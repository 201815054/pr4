WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in July as consumers cut back on purchases of motor vehicles, and could slow further in the months ahead amid spiraling new COVID-19 infections and a reduction in unemployment benefit checks.
Despite the moderation in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Friday, sales have recouped losses suffered when businesses were shuttered to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The third straight monthly gain lifted retail sales to their highest level since the government started tracking the series in 1992. It supported the view that consumer spending would rebound this quarter after a record collapse in the second quarter.
Economists attributed the increase in retail sales over the past three months to a $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement from the government, which amounted to almost $75 billion in July. The supplement ended on July 31, leaving economists to expect a decline in retail sales in August. 
""It looks like the skies are darkening once again as the second-wave shutdowns clamp down harder on economic activity and the federal government stops sending $600 weekly checks to the unemployed,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The pandemic isn't over yet and the recession won't be either if Congress and the president can't come to an agreement on how to best support the nascent recovery in a hurry.""
Retail sales rose 1.2% last month after advancing 8.4% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would rise 1.9% in July. Sales increased 2.7% from a year ago in July.
President Donald Trump on Saturday signed a number of executive orders, including one that extended the supplement, though he reduced the weekly payout to $400.
States are required to cover $100 of the benefits under the order, but they are under immense financial pressure due to the pandemic. The remaining $300 will be funded from a limited emergency disaster relief program, which economists estimated could be depleted as early as September. 
A top White House advisor said this week that Trump's plan would provide an extra $300 per week. Republicans and Democrats are bickering over new aid for the economy even as signs mount that activity is stalling as coronavirus infections continue to spread across the United States.
Job growth slowed in July. About 28.3 million people are on unemployment benefits.
The slowdown in retail sales in July was led by a 1.2% decline in receipts at auto dealerships. That followed a 6.1% acceleration in June. Consumers also cut back spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores as well as at building materials outlets.
STEADY SENTIMENT 
Purchases at electronics and appliance stores soared 22.9% last month, likely reflecting strong demand as many Americans work from home. 
Receipts at restaurants and bars increased 5.0%, though the pace slowed from the 26.7% notched in June. Online and mail-order retail sales rebounded 0.7%. Furniture store sales were flat. Receipts at clothing stores increased 5.7%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales increased 1.4% in July after soaring 6.0% in June. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the gross domestic product report.
Consumer spending collapsed at a 34.6% annualized pace in the second quarter. That led GDP to plunge at a 32.9% rate last quarter, the deepest decline in output since the government started keeping records in 1947.
A separate report from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment steady in mid-August, though consumers anticipated ""bad economic times to persist not only in the year ahead"" and many ""expect no return to a period of uninterrupted growth over the next five years.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed in midday trading. The dollar (DXY) was trading lower against a basket of currencies while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
""Providing further assistance to struggling households will be essential to keeping growth momentum from faltering,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""This is even more critical as recent research have highlighted that low-income families have played a central role in driving the initial phase of the recovery in consumption."" 
Though motor vehicle sales fell last month, manufacturers continued to ramp up production, boosting output at the nation's factories, a third report from the Federal Reserve showed. Manufacturing production rose 3.4% in July after surging 7.4% in June. Still, the third straight monthly gain left factory output about 8% below its level in February.

""Excess capacity throughout the economy will weigh on production of investment goods,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburg. ""The biggest downside risk is a failure of Congress and the Trump administration to agree on a fiscal stimulus package that would support consumer demand during a period of very high unemployment.""

Business inventories fell 1.1% in June after decreasing 2.3% in May, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories, a key component of gross domestic product, have now declined for six straight months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast business stocks falling 1.2% in June.
Retail inventories decreased 2.6% in June as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 6.2% fall in April. Motor vehicle inventories tumbled 6.7% rather than 6.5% as previously reported. 
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, dropped 0.8% as reported last month.
The prolonged inventory drawdown contributed to GDP declining at a record 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted almost 4 percentage points from GDP, the most since the fourth quarter of 1982. 
Inventories have declined for five straight quarters. The economy fell into recession is February.
Wholesale inventories fell 1.4% in June. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.6%.

Business sales increased 8.4% in June after rebounding 8.5% in the prior month. At June's sales pace, it would take 1.37 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.50 months in May.

2,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 10:29AM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing output rises strongly in July, but still below pre-pandemic levels","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory output increased more than expected in July, boosted by a surge in motor vehicle production, though activity remained below its pre-COVID-19 pandemic peak. 
The Federal Reserve said on Friday that manufacturing production rose 3.4% last month after advancing 7.4% in June. The third straight monthly gain left factory output about 8% below its level in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would increase 3.0% in July.
While businesses have reopened, new coronavirus cases continue to spread across the country, keeping a lid on demand. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy, was struggling even before the pandemic hit the nation, a casualty of the Trump administration's trade war with China.
Lower crude prices as global economies buckle under the coronavirus strain have also undercut spending by oil producers on drilling and shaft exploration equipment. Business spending on equipment has declined for five straight quarters, the longest such stretch since 2016.
Motor vehicles and parts production increased 28.3% in July after accelerating 118.3% in June. There were also increases in machinery, computer and electronic products, and electrical equipment, appliances and components.
The rise in manufacturing output, together with a 3.3% increase in utilities and a 0.8% gain in mining, lifted industrial production 3.0% in July. That followed a 5.7% increase in June. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased 2.3 percentage points to 69.2% in July. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose 2.1 percentage points to 70.6%. It is 9.2 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 7.3% annualized rate last quarter, its largest rise since the second quarter of 2009. Productivity fell at a 0.3% pace in the January-March period. Hours worked tumbled at a 43.0% rate in the second quarter, the largest since the series started in the first quarter of 1947.

Investing.com -- The rebound in U.S. retail sales faltered in July, as the exuberance of pent-up demand faded against a backdrop of record unemployment.
Retail sales rose only 1.2% from June, after gains of over 18% and 8% in May and June. The figure was below consensus forecasts for 1.9% growth ahead of time.
Core retail sales, a series that excludes automobiles, rose 1.9% on the month, better than the 1.3% gain expected but still a clear slowdown from 8.3% in June. 
In year-on-year terms, sales were still 2.7% ahead of July 2019, helped in large measure by government support measures that have been drastically cut since the end of the month.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>","Euro zone trade surplus surges as imports drop, GDP and employment in record fall","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone's trade surplus with the rest of the world jumped in June to 21.2 billion euros ($25 billion) as the bloc's drop in imports of goods outpaced the fall of exports amid a global decline in the trade due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The bloc also experienced in the second quarter of 2020 its worst drop in employment ever recorded, the European Union's statistics agency Eurostat said. 
It also confirmed the record fall of the bloc's gross domestic product in the second quarter, which fell by 12.1% compared to the first three months of the year.
Eurostat said on Friday the June trade surplus was higher than that posted a year earlier when the bloc had a positive balance of 19.4 billion euros. The reading also largely beat market expectations of a 12.6 billion euros surplus. 
The surplus was more than twice as big as that recorded in May when the bloc had a positive balance of 9.4 billion euros.
The year-on-year improvement was caused by a 12.2% drop of imports, which more than offset the 10% fall in exports, Eurostat estimates showed.
The 19 countries of the currency bloc also traded much less among themselves. In June they exchanged goods worth 150.6 billion euros, down by 7.3% compared with the same month last year.
The larger EU, which is composed of 27 states, posted a 20.7 billion euros surplus in June, also caused by a bigger drop in imports than exports.
Among its top three trading partners, the EU reduced trade mostly with Britain, which left the EU on Jan. 31. Trade with the United States also fell significantly while the drop of exchanges with China was small.
In a separate release, Eurostat said euro zone employment in the period between April and June fell by 2.8% compared to the previous quarter, in the sharpest decline since data began to be collected in 1995.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>",China's economic recovery underwhelms as consumer comeback stays elusive,"By Kevin Yao and Stella Qiu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's retail sales slipped in July, dashing expectations for a modest rise, as consumers in the world's second-largest economy failed to shake off wariness about the coronavirus, while the factory sector's recovery struggled to pick up pace.
Asian markets pulled back on Friday following the disappointing set of economic indicators, which raised concerns about the fragility of China's emergence from coronavirus.
China's recovery had been gaining momentum after the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy as pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports revived activity.
However, July data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday showed weaker-than-expected year-on-year industrial output growth and retail sales extending declines into a seventh straight month. That was slightly offset by firmer property investment, which showed recent stimulus was supporting construction.
Some analysts attributed the loss of momentum in the economy to the torrential rains that have flooded Southern China since June and several fresh COVID-19 outbreaks that led to partial lockdowns.
""Although there could be a modest rebound in some investment activities if the floods subside in coming months, we expect sequential recovery momentum to get weaker in H2,"" Nomura analysts said in a note, citing factors such as receding pent-up demand, diminished chances of more policy easing and rising U.S.-China tensions.
Industrial output grew 4.8% in July from a year earlier, in line with June's growth but less than a forecast 5.1% rise.
Retail sales dropped 1.1% on year, missing predictions for a 0.1% rise and following June's 1.8% fall.
The decline in retail sales was broad based with garments, cosmetics, home appliances and furniture all worsening from June.
A key exception was auto sales, which surged 12.3%, turning around from a 8.2% fall in June.
""Despite narrowing declines in investment, consumption remained weak, highlighting the lasting economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management. 
""Given we are likely to see a resurgence of COVID in the autumn and winter, it is not recommended that monetary policy be tightened too prematurely and fiscal policy stay insufficient.""
China's July nationwide survey-based jobless rate remained elevated at 5.7%, the same as June. 
INVESTMENT BRIGHT SPOT
Helping carry the recovery, however, was investment, which was driven by the fast expansion in the property sector, with analysts expecting infrastructure spending to accelerate in coming months on the back of government support.
China's economy returned to growth in the second quarter after a deep slump at the start of the year, but unexpected weakness in domestic consumption has slowed the momentum. 
Fixed-asset investment fell 1.6% in January-July from the same period last year, in line with expectations but slower than a 3.1% decline in the first half of the year. 
July property investment grew at the quickest clip since April last year, underpinned by solid construction activity and easier lending. New home prices rose at a slightly slower pace in July from a month earlier.
Infrastructure investment, a powerful driver of growth, fell 1.0% year-on-year, easing from a decline of 2.7% in the first half.
""After the floods are over, I believe the reconstruction work for affected areas will boost fixed-asset investment and industrial production,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING.
Another major risk is the increasingly tense U.S.-China relationship ahead of the U.S. presidential elections in November, which analysts say has prompted Beijing to focus on domestically driven growth.
""Changes in U.S.-China relations definitely have an impact on China, as well as the United States,"" statistics bureau spokesman Fu Linghui told a press conference. 

""We still hope to maintain the equal and mutually beneficial development (in relations).""

Investing.com - Chinese economic recovery from COVID-19 took an unexpected stumble, with July’s retail sales and factory output figures both missing analyst forecasts.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics data released on Friday, industrial output grew 4.8% in July year-on-year. The figure was lower than the 5.1% increase in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but remained unchanged from June. 
Meanwhile, retail sales dropped 1.1% year-on-year, an improvement from the 1.8% drop recorded in June but still below the forecasted increase of 0.1%. Sales also recorded a seventh consecutive month of declines, attributable to weak consumer demand due to COVID-19.
Unemployment remained unchanged at 5.7%.
“Clearly the hope for a fast recovery has faded - the consumption still lags behind and the job market is still under pressure,” Zhou Hao, senior Emerging Markets economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY), told Bloomberg.
With policy makers emphasizing risk control and rolling back some stimulus, “growth momentum will be slowing down in near future,” he added.
China saw its recovery quicken in the second quarter after easing COVID-19 lockdown measures in April, with demand, stimulus measures and surprisingly resilient exports all contributing to the speed. But high unemployment, leading to continuously weak consumer demand, is proving to be an Achilles heel.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China said on the same day that it would add short-term funds into the financial system, the most since May, to improve liquidity."

The world's largest steel producer churned out 93.36 million tonnes of crude steel last month, 1.9% higher than the output seen in June and up 9.1% from July 2019, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Average daily output of the metal stood at 3.01 million tonnes in July compared with 3.05 million tonnes in June, according to Reuters calculations based on the official data.
The consumption of steel in July was underpinned by demand for flat steel products used in products from cars and appliances, even as heavy rain hurt demand for steel products used in construction activities. 
Production of hot-rolled coils and cold-rolled coils at major mills jumped nearly 28% in July from a month earlier, according to data compiled by Mysteel consultancy, while output for steel reinforcing bars used in buildings rose 18%. 
""As the monsoon season has come to an end, demand for construction rebar has stabilised since late-July and (is) expected to further recover in coming months,"" Zhuo Guiqiu, analyst with Jinrui Capital said before the data was released. 
Blast furnace capacity utilisation rates among China's 247 steel mills rose for the fourth consecutive week to 95.16% as of Aug.14, weekly data compiled by Mysteel showed.

For the first seven months of the year, China produced 593.17 million tonnes of crude steel, rising 2.8% from the same period in 2019, the NBS data showed.

Real estate investment in July rose 11.7% from a year earlier, quickening from 8.5% growth seen in June, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday.
For January-July period, property investment grew 3.4% on an annual basis, faster than a 1.9% uptick in January-June. 
China's property market was among the first to recover after reopening of the economy this year on cheaper credit as well as relaxation on urban residential curbs, with some analysts warning of a potential bubble in a handful of big cities. 
But others have dismissed the suggestions of a possible bubble and say a full-blown rebound may take longer to arrive as consumer confidence remains soft. 
Property sales by floor area rose 9.5% in July from a year earlier, versus a 2.1% growth in June.
New construction starts measured by floor area increased 11.3% on-year last month, compared with June's 8.9% uptick.
Funds raised by China's property developers returned to growth of 0.8% in the first seven months, better than a 1.9% drop in the first half of 2020.

11,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Japan’s Economy Set to Crater by a Record in Awful Quarter,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s pandemic-hit economy shrank last quarter by the most in records going back to 1955, official data is set to show Monday, with a resurgence of the virus threatening to slow a fragile recovery now under way.
Analysts see gross domestic product contracting at an annualized pace of 27% in the three months through June. That means the world’s third-largest economy will have declined in size for three straight quarters, hit first by trade wars and a sales tax hike, then by the virus.
The cratering of Japan’s economy follows grim readings from other major countries reeling from the impact of Covid-19. The U.K. contracted 20.4% last quarter. The U.S., where the virus still rages on, shrank by nearly a third.
The size of the declines helps explain the massive scale of support rolled out by Japan and other countries to keep companies and households afloat, with more measures expected even though the worst of the economic damage is likely over.
A five-week nationwide state of emergency devastated consumption in the second quarter as people stayed at home and businesses closed, but retail sales and factory output in Japan are already showing signs of recovery.
Still, weak overseas demand for cars and other Japanese exports is likely to continue and there will be no Olympics spending boost from tourists this quarter with the Games postponed.
The biggest factor clouding the outlook is the trajectory of the pandemic itself.
“What happens after this really depends on Covid-19,” said economist Yoshiki Shinke at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute. “I don’t think the economy will return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon.”
Japan’s Economy Seen Taking Four Years to Regain Lost Ground
Japan’s death toll of just over 1,000 is still tiny compared with the U.S. and some other countries, but a recent jump in new infections -- with another 206 confirmed in Tokyo on Thursday -- could weigh on the recovery if people become too fearful to travel, eat out or shop.
A campaign launched last month to reboot domestic travel and spur spending was initially supposed to cover the entire country, but Tokyo ended up excluded after concern grew over the virus’s spread in the capital.
Government measures worth more than 40% of GDP, including job-retention subsidies, loan guarantees and cash handouts, have helped prevent a surge in bankruptcies and the official jobless rate, but economists still expect more aid to come in the autumn even if it draws largely on reserves set aside in recent budgets.
“Whether or not the government brings more money from somewhere else,” said Yoshimasa Maruyama, economist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., “there’ll definitely be another response package.”

12,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 11:52AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims fall below one million; labor market pain far from over,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits dropped below one million last week for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, but that was likely as the expiration of a $600 weekly supplement discouraged some from filing claims.
The report from the Labor Department on Thursday did little to change economists' views that the jobs market recovery was faltering. Data from payroll scheduling and workforce management firms suggested a decline in employment in early August due to the spread of new COVID-19 cases across the United States. 
""It is too early to declare victory as there is a long way to go to stop the bleeding of the labor markets and part of the reason for reduced filings looks to be tied to the expiration of that $600 weekly turbo-boost for unemployment benefits from the expired Federal program at the end of July,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 228,000 to a seasonally adjusted 963,000 for the week ended Aug. 8. That was the lowest level since mid-March when authorities started shutting down non-essential business to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.12 million applications in the latest week.
Claims peaked at a record 6.867 million in late March. Even with last week's decrease, claims are well above their 695,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. A total 28.3 million people were receiving unemployment checks at the end of July. 
There were big declines in claims last week in Florida, Georgia and California, some of the states that have been hardest hit by new waves of coronavirus infections. Businesses in some areas in these states have been shut down again and in some instances, reopenings have been paused. 
Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed a decline in employment last week. Figures from Kronos, a workforce management software company, showed a flattening in the number of shifts worked.
The government reported last week that the economy created 1.763 million jobs in July after adding a record 4.791 million in June. It has regained only 9.3 million of the 22 million jobs lost between February and April. 
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar (DXY) fell 
against a basket of currencies. U.S Treasury prices rose.
LAYOFFS SEEN PERSISTING
The $600 extra unemployment benefit lapsed on July 31. President Donald Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that included an extension of the supplement, though he reduced the weekly payout to $400. 
But there has been confusion over the order. States are required to cover $100 of the benefit, but governors have said they don't have the financial capacity after revenues were decimated in the fight against the pandemic. 
The remaining $300 will be funded from a limited emergency disaster relief program, which economists estimated could be depleted as early as September. Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said this week Trump's plan would provide an extra $300 per week. 
Industry groups and Republicans claimed the $600 weekly supplement, which was higher than the minimum wage in many states, was encouraging some unemployed people to stay at home. Many economists rejected the argument and credited the supplement for the economy's nascent recovery from a recession triggered by the coronavirus. There is one job for every three people unemployed, making it harder to secure employment. 
While the loss of the supplement might have helped to push weekly jobless claims down, economists estimate it will reduce household income by roughly $75 billion per month, which will weigh on consumer spending and cause struggling companies to lay off workers. A government-funded program offering businesses loans to help with wages has also lapsed. 
Trump said on Thursday funding for the U.S. Postal Service and to shore up election infrastructure is the main sticking point in talks between the White House and Democrats over a fresh round of coronavirus relief. Trump is lagging former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee, in polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election .
""We've not yet seen the light at the end of the tunnel for millions of workers,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. ""With no sign yet of a new relief package, the question is whether sheer momentum can keep pushing the economic recovery forward in this historically deep crisis.""
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 604,000 to 15.486 million in the week ending Aug. 1. 
""It is also possible that recent declines in continuing claims filings in regular state programs are related to people exhausting eligibility rather than improvement in the labor market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We have seen filings for the programs that could kick in once other eligibility is exhausted jump lately.""

There were nearly 1.4 claims filed across the extended benefits and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program in the week ending July 25.

13,By Investing.com,"<span>Aug 13, 2020 08:34AM ET</span>","Initial Jobless Claims Fell to 963,000 Last Week, Lowest Since March","By Noreen Burke
Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits fell to 963,000 last week, the lowest weekly total since late March, when lockdowns were put in place around the country to slow the spread of Covid-19.
The numbers add to evidence of an ongoing recovery in the labor market, despite fears that the improvement had stalled due to the surge in coronavirus cases across the south and west of the U.S. in June and July.
Economists had forecast a more modest decline to 1.120 million. 
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased to 15.486 million. The previous week's figure was also revised downwards to 16.090 million.
In addition, the Labor Department said another 489,000 people applied for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, down from 656,000 the previous week. The sharp drop may reflect in part the reduced incentive to apply for the benefits, funding for which under the CARES Act expired at the end of July.
Investors are worried that that last month’s expiration of the extra $600 in enhanced weekly unemployment benefits will hit consumer spending and act a drag on the recovery. President Trump has signed an executive order extending payouts at half that level. 
The sharper-than-expected drop in claims takes a little of the pressure off Congress and the White House officials to agree the size and scope of the next coronavirus fiscal relief bill. House Democrats have passed a bill with a sticker price of $3.5 trillion while the Republican-led Senate and the Administration are proposing measures that amount to a more conservative $1 trillion.
San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said on Wednesday the economic recovery will be slow and gradual depending on how the virus progresses, and added that she is not expecting a V-shaped recovery.
Any policies that can encourage consumers to keep spending during the downturn will help the recovery, Daly said."

The jobless rate fell to 7.1%, from 7.8% in the first quarter, hitting its lowest level since the second quarter of 1983, when it stood at 7.0%.
INSEE warned that unemployment data for the first two quarters of 2020 was skewed because of the mid-March to mid-May lockdown, which reduced the number of those classified as unemployed by making it impossible for them to look for jobs.

The International Labour Organisation defines being unemployed as not working but being available to work and actively seeking a job - which was virtually impossible in many industries during lockdown.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Investor confidence in Thailand's capital markets over the next three months dropped for the first time in four months, unsettled by recent anti-government protests, a capital market association said on Thursday.
The risk coming from political turbulence is adding to pressure on the government as policy makers struggle to revive an economy expected to shrink by a record amount as the coronavirus pandemic upends tourism and consumption.
The Federation of Thai Capital Market Organisations said its July survey showed the investor confidence index fell to 85.26 from 101.19 in the previous month.
""The main reason was politics. It's the first time in months that political factors took the spotlight and played a role in investment,"" the federation's chairman, Paiboon Nalinthrangkurn, told a briefing.
Demonstrators have called for the removal of the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, amendments to the constitution and reforms of the monarchy.
The Thai stock index (SETI) has fallen by 15% so far this year, with foreign investors dumping 231 billion baht ($7.44 billion) of shares.
Investors remained concerned about the economy and the earnings of listed companies, but they hoped a new government economic team would help restore confidence, Paiboon said.
""From now on, it will depend on the new team and whether they will have policies to build market confidence,"" he said.
In a cabinet shake-up, banking executive Predee Daochai was picked as finance minister and given the tough task of pulling Southeast Asia's second-largest economy out of a deep slump. 

The finance ministry expects the economy to shrink 8.5% this year, although the government has introduced stimulus measures, including a 1.9 trillion baht package, in a bid to mitigate the outbreak impact.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment surged further in July, handily beating forecasts, though the increase was still not enough to offset the ballooning numbers of those looking for work as the jobless rate ticked up to a 22-year high.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Thursday showed employment jumped by 114,700, on top of a hefty 210,800 new jobs in June and surpassing expectations for a 40,000 increase as large parts of the economy re-opened.
Australia has been one of the few countries in the world with relatively low numbers of coronavirus infections and death. Most states and territories reopened their economies in late May, although a recent resurgence of cases and deaths in Victoria marked an unwelcome setback.
The July jobs boost came as the number of people out of work, available to work and actively looking for work topped one million for the first time ever, the data showed.
Indeed, the participation rate rose by 0.6 percentage points to 64.7%. As a result, the jobless rate climbed to 7.5% from 7.4% in June, highest since late 1998, but below the 7.8% forecast.
The monthly increase in employment was underpinned by a jump of 71,200 in part-time work while full-time jobs rose by 43,500. 
Employment was still more than half a million people lower than in March when coronavirus-driven shutdowns kicked in.
""The pick-up in employment in July is likely to be unwound in the coming months as the stricter lockdown in Victoria weighs on the labour market,"" said Ben Udy, analyst at Capital Economics.
Udy expects the unemployment rate to shoot up to 8.5% in coming months.

""... the stalling in business and consumer confidence suggest that the recovery in other states is running out of steam.""

Exports of information and communications products picked up 3.3% from a year ago, compared to a 1% rise in June, according to data Thursday from South Korea’s trade ministry. Technology exports had contracted in April and May as the pandemic kept large swathes of the globe in lockdown.
The second month of gains in technology exports, a key portion of trade revenue, shows that demand remains strong for devices that allow people to work and study from home. Major tech companies around the world continue to stock up on chips and other electronic components needed to meet demand for online activities.
Shipments of memory chips rose 5% in July, after contracting in June. Exports of system semiconductors, which help process data, rose 8%, their third consecutive monthly increase. Mobile-phone sales rose 21%, their first rise since March. Sales of computer storage devices jumped 124%.
South Korea discloses total exports at the start of each month; they fell 7% in July. That’s followed later by a breakdown of technology shipments, which offer more clues about global demand.

The Australian dollar advanced on the data and was trading at 71.81 U.S. cents at 11:41 a.m. in Sydney.
The data set the scene before Melbourne moved to Stage 4 restrictions and a curfew and surrounding Victoria state to Stage 3 to try to contain a rapidly spreading outbreak.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 09:15PM ET</span>",Japan's wholesale price fall eases further as economy emerges from coronavirus jolt,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's wholesale prices fell at a smaller annual pace in July than in the previous month as global and domestic demand rebounded, a sign the economy was gradually emerging from the damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.
But analysts expect any pick-up in prices to remain shallow as fears of a huge second wave of infections weigh on business and consumer sentiment.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods, fell 0.9% in July from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Thursday, less than a median market forecast for a 1.1% drop.
The decline was less steeper than a 1.6% fall in June and the smallest downturn since March, when it was off 0.5%.
Declines in gasoline, chemical and nonferrous metal prices eased in July, reflecting a pick-up in demand as China and many advanced economies lifted lockdowns, the data showed.
Agricultural goods prices also fell at a much slower pace than in June, as demand for beef and other food products recovered after Japan ended lockdown measures in late May.
""As economies re-open, downward pressure on prices from the pandemic appears to be easing,"" Ichiro Muto, head of the BOJ's price statistics division, told reporters.
""But there's no change to the broader picture, in which the pandemic is weighing heavily on wholesale prices,"" he said.
Japan's economy slipped into recession and is expected to have suffered an annualised contraction of 27.2% in April-June, as the coronavirus crisis crushed business and consumer spending.

While economic activity has re-opened, a recent surge in infection numbers is clouding the outlook for the recovery.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","UK housing boom gathers pace, but fears of a bust grow too: RICS","LONDON (Reuters) - The rebound in Britain's housing market gathered more pace in July with a measure of property prices turning positive for the first time since the coronavirus crisis engulfed the country, a survey showed on Thursday.
But the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said its members were worried the mini-boom could turn into a bust once the government's jobs subsidy programme closes in less than three months' time and a tax cut expires at the end of March.
The RICS monthly house price balance rose to +12 from June's -13, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. London was the only region to show price falls last month and even there the pace of decline slowed.
Simon Rubinsohn, RICS's chief economist, said surveyors were more cautious about the outlook in the medium term with the economy expected to recover only slowly from its record second-quarter crash and finance minister Rishi Sunak's property tax cut set to vanish in April.
""Significantly, some contributors are now even referencing the possibility of a boom followed by a bust,"" he said. 
Sunak last month temporarily raised the starting threshold of a tax on property purchases to 500,000 pounds ($652,100) to boost activity in the housing market after the coronavirus lockdown.
RICS said enquiries by new buyers rose strongly in July for a second month. Agreed sales, which were falling sharply earlier in 2020, jumped too.
Sales were expected to grow over the next three months but to be falling in 12 months' time.
RICS also confirmed signals picked up by other housing market players that buyers are increasingly looking for properties with access to green spaces, gardens or balconies which would help them cope with any future lockdowns.
Separately, a think tank said first-time home buyers were unlikely to gain from an expected fall in house prices which has been forecast by Britain's independent budget office.
""Falling incomes and the risk of more restrictive lending look set to make buying a home for the first time every bit as difficult as before the crisis,"" the Resolution Foundation said in a report published on Thursday.

""Policymakers must ensure that young people's incomes are protected in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, and that their competitive advantage as first-time buyers is maintained when the stamp duty holiday comes to an end,"" policy analyst Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Judge said.

The July deficit brought the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $2.81 trillion, compared to $867 billion for the comparable period of 2019 and doubling the 2009 full-year record deficit of $1.4 trillion.
The budget deficit for July was smaller than the $193 billion deficit forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. But many analysts still anticipate a full-year deficit approaching $4 trillion. The fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
Outlays in July were $626 billion, up from $371 billion a year earlier and down from about $1.1 trillion in June. A Treasury official said the higher figure for June was due to about $511 billion in costs recognized for disbursement of small business loans under the Paycheck Protection Program that were sharply lower in July.
Receipts for July more than doubled from a year earlier to $563 billion as a result of payment of non-withheld taxes due on July 15, a deadline that was delayed from the traditional April 15 deadline due to the coronavirus epidemic.

Receipts for the fiscal 2020 year-to-date period were $2.82 trillion, down slightly from $2.86 trillion in the year-earlier period. A Treasury official said this was because of stronger revenues early in the year, coupled with income replacement aid, including PPP loans that kept employees on payrolls and supplemental unemployment benefits that were subject to tax withholding.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices push higher; high unemployment likely to keep lid on inflation,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in July, with a measure of underlying inflation increasing by the most in 29-1/2 years amid broad gains in the costs of goods and services.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday, however, probably does not mark the start of worrisome inflation, and the Federal Reserve is likely to continue pumping money into the economy to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 recession. 
The jump in prices is likely an unwinding of sharp declines experienced when nonessential businesses were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The higher prices further dispel fears of deflation, a decline in the general price level that is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
""This should end any speculation that the pandemic-related slump in demand will quickly push the economy into a deflationary spiral,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""But this is not a sign that the U.S. is instead about to experience a bout of much high inflation because of supply restrictions."" 
The consumer price index rose 0.6% last month, with gasoline accounting for a quarter of the gain. The CPI increased by the same margin in June. In the 12 months through July, the CPI accelerated 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in June. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI jumped 0.6% last month as the cost of motor vehicle insurance surged a record 9.3%. That was the largest gain in the so-called core CPI since January 1991 and followed a 0.2% rise in June. In the 12 months through July, the core CPI advanced 1.6% after increasing 1.2% in June.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would rise 0.3% in July and the core CPI would gain 0.2%.
The report followed on the heels of news on Tuesday that producer prices accelerated in July. 
With at last 31.3 million people on unemployment benefits, inflation is hardly a threat in the services-oriented economy.
""The biggest input to service sector prices is labor, and when you have more that 30 million people claiming unemployment benefits there is likely to be a glut for quite a while,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""This will keep wage pressure subdued, thus limiting the upside for service sector inflation.""
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 0.9% on a year-on-year basis in June. Economists expect July data, which will be released later this month, will show the core PCE price index rose about 1.4%.
The U.S. central bank has adopted an extraordinarily easy monetary policy, slashing interest rates to near zero as well as making large-scale asset purchases and funneling loans to firms among other measures. But the budding recovery from the pandemic is showing signs of stress as new coronavirus infections spiral across the United States, forcing authorities in some of the hot spots to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings.
Job growth slowed significantly in July. The economy, which entered recession in February, suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) index edging toward a record high. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading mostly lower.
FOOD PRICE RELIEF
In July, gasoline prices advanced 5.6% after soaring 12.3% in June. Food prices fell 0.4%, the first decrease since April 2019, after rising 0.6% in June. The cost of food consumed at home dropped 1.1%, with beef prices tumbling 8.2% after surging in recent months. But the cost of food consumed away from home rose 0.5%, with full-service meals increasing 0.4%. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.2%. That followed June's 0.1% gain, the smallest rise since July 2013. Many tenants have entered into forbearance agreements with landlords. 
Consumers also paid more for healthcare in July, with prices rising 0.4%. The cost of doctor visits increased 0.7% and prices for hospital services rose 0.2%. The cost of prescription medication, however, fell 0.2%.
Prices for wireless telephone services rose 3.6%. Prices of used cars and trucks increased 2.3% after three straight monthly declines. The cost of airline fares jumped 5.4%, the biggest rise since July 1999. Prices for hotel and motel accommodation increased 1.3%.
New motor vehicles prices gained 0.8% and those of apparel advanced 1.1%. There were also increases in the prices of household furnishings, recreation, personal care products and services.

""The weakness in rents is arguably more indicative for longer-term inflation trends than the rebounds in travel and core goods, and the weakness is more likely to persist"" said Oscar Munoz, macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.

27,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 12, 2020 10:17AM ET</span>",UK economy faces long climb back to health after historic 20% crash,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank by a record 20.4% in the second quarter when the coronavirus lockdown was tightest, the most severe contraction reported by any major economy so far, with a wave of job losses set to hit later in 2020.
The scale of the economic hit may also revive questions about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's handling of the pandemic, with Britain suffering the highest death toll in Europe. More than 50,000 UK deaths have been linked to the disease.
""Today's figures confirm that hard times are here,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. ""Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs, and sadly in the coming months many more will.""
The data confirmed that the world's sixth-biggest economy had entered a recession, with the low point coming in April when output was more than 25% below its pre-pandemic level.
Growth restarted in May and quickened in June, when the economy expanded by a monthly 8.7% - a record single-month increase and slightly stronger than forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll.
However, some analysts said the bounce-back was unlikely to be sustained.
Last week the Bank of England forecast it would take until the final quarter of 2021 for the economy to regain its previous size, and warned unemployment was likely to rise sharply.
Any decision to pump more stimulus into the economy by the BoE and finance minister Sunak will hinge on the pace of growth in the coming months, and whether the worst-hit sectors such as face-to-face retail and business travel ever fully recover.
The second-quarter GDP slump exceeded the 12.1% drop in the euro zone and the 9.5% fall in the United States. 
Some economists said the sharper decline partly reflected the timing of Britain's lockdown - which fell more in the second quarter - and its dependence on domestic consumer spending.
PENT-UP DEMAND
Suren Thiru, an economist with the British Chambers of Commerce, said the recent pick-up probably only reflected the release of pent-up demand rather than a sustained revival.
""The prospect of a swift 'V-shaped' recovery remains remote,"" he said.
Britain's unemployment rate is expected to jump when the government ends its huge job subsidy programme in October.
Sunak - who told the BBC he saw some ""promising signs"" in GDP data for the month of June - reiterated his opposition to extending the programme.
In July he cut sales tax for the hospitality sector and in August is subsidising restaurants to draw in diners.
Hotels and restaurants did just one fifth of their normal business in June, when the lockdown was still largely in force. 
LATER LOCKDOWN
British GDP shrank by 2.2% in the first quarter of the year, reflecting the lockdown that started on March 24.
Britain closed restaurants, shops and other public spaces after many other European countries, meaning more of the hit was felt in the second quarter. 
However, the Office for National Statistics said that over the first six months of 2020, British GDP fell by 22.1%, slightly less than Spain's 22.7% but more than double the 10.6% fall in United States.
""The larger contraction of the UK economy primarily reflects how lockdown measures have been in place for a larger part of this period in the UK,"" it said.
Non-essential shops in England did not reopen until June 15, and pubs and restaurants were shut until July 4.
Sunak, as well as some economists, said Britain's greater reliance on consumer-facing services businesses - many of which were completely shut in the lockdown - also explained why the economy suffered more than its peers.
In both Britain and Spain spending on hotels, restaurants, recreation and culture make up around 13% of the economy, compared with around 10% or less elsewhere in Europe and the United States.
Although some sectors appear to have made a rapid recovery, businesses are wary about the outlook, especially as a second wave of COVID infections could lead to the reimposition of lockdowns. 

Employers have already shed more than 700,000 jobs since March, according to tax data.

The manufacturing output increase was driven by a surge in production of durable goods, such as cars or fridges, in what could be seen as a positive sign of consumer confidence as COVID-19 restrictions were eased in the region.
However, the month-on-month increase was lower than economists had forecast. It slowed from May, and production remained largely below pre-crisis levels.
Manufacturing output in the 19-country currency bloc rose by 9.1% in June from May, the European Union statistics office Eurostat said, after it had increased by 12.3% in May on the month.
Economists polled by Reuters had predicted a 10.0% rise in June month-on-month. The May reading had also disappointed economists who had been expecting a 15% rise as factories reopened after lockdowns were softened.
Eurostat also slightly revised downward from 12.4% its previous estimate of industrial output in May.
In a clearer sign that the bloc's manufacturing sector is still far from having recovered, output tumbled by 12.3% in June on the year, more than market expectations of a 11.5% fall.
The year-on-year drop was less pronounced than in May and April, confirming a gradual rebound. All countries for which data were available posted an annual drop, with the exception of Ireland where industrial output grew by 4.5% in June compared to a year earlier.
Month-on-month, production of durable goods rose by 20.2%, the highest increase among segments assessed by Eurostat.
Output of capital goods also went up significantly, by 14.2%, in what could show stronger appetite for investments among factory managers.

Production of energy went up by only 2.6%, while output of non-durable consumer goods, such a clothing or canned food, rose by 4.8% on the month.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian wages grew at their slowest pace on record in the second quarter, underscoring the damage the coronavirus has done to household spending, after recent data showed consumer confidence and business conditions were hit.
The official wage price index (WPI) rose 0.2% in the three months to the end of June, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported on Wednesday. That was below the already subdued 0.3% forecast in a Reuters poll and the 0.5% growth seen in the first quarter.
Annual wage growth slowed to 1.8%, well below the levels that used to be considered standard for the country.
Both annual and quarterly wage growth were the weakest since records began in September 1997.
The data marked the first full period that captured the impact of COVID-19-driven social and business restrictions, said Andrew Tomadini, head of price statistics at the ABS.
Private sector wages fell for the first time on record, in original terms, easing 0.1% in the second quarter from the first three months of the year.
""The fall in private sector wages is mainly due to a number of large wage reductions across senior executive and higher paid jobs,"" Tomadini noted.
Data out earlier showed a measure of Australian consumer sentiment fell sharply in August as a strict coronavirus lockdown in Victoria state darkened the mood in a major setback to the country's fledgling economic recovery. 
A measure of business confidence, released on Tuesday, also showed a hit from the situation in Victoria.
""Looking ahead, wages growth is likely to remain very weak given the collapse in employment and the depressed economic environment,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist, at BIS Oxford Economics.
Australian states have already announced plans for wage freezes in the face of budget pressures.
That, together with tepid inflation, means wage growth will stay depressed for a long time to come, cementing views the country's central bank will maintain its accommodative approach. 

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) slashed interest rates to a record low 0.25% in an emergency meeting in March. It has since stood pat on rates.

Tourism accounts for about 9% of Mexican gross domestic product, but tourists stayed away from foreign countries during the pandemic-triggered lockdown.

33,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 08:54PM ET</span>",Australia Households Spooked as Confidence Collapses on Victoria,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s consumer confidence collapsed as Melbourne shifted to Stage 4 Covid-19 restrictions, including a nightime curfew, and a contagion-like effect rolled across the rest of the country.
The sentiment index tumbled 9.5% to 79.5 in August, approaching the lows recorded in April during the peak of the nationwide lockdown,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. said Wednesday in a statement. Reflecting nervousness spreading beyond Victoria’s borders, confidence plunged 15.5% in New South Wales, the nation’s most populous state.
“Consumers across the nation appear to have been rattled by the developments in Victoria and fear that other states may also succumb to the ‘second wave’ outbreak,” said Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac. “Our view is that these fears are likely to have become overblown. While consumers are right to be concerned, virus risks still look low outside Victoria.”
Australia is mired in recession and Victoria’s renewed lockdown to try to contain its spiraling infections is likely to extend that into the current quarter. While the state is effectively isolated from the rest of the country due to border closures, worries about renewed bouts of infections is eroding confidence nationwide.
“For now, we feel the August sentiment read should be treated with more caution than usual,” Evans said. “Consumers are clearly fearful of the Covid threat and uncertain about how it will play out. And that will have some bearing on their decisions near term.”
The poll was based on responses from 1,200 people and conducted in the week from Aug. 3-8.
All five component indexes in the survey recorded declines in August, with the largest falls around “expectations for the economy and assessments of time to buy a major item,” Evans said. The “economy, next 12 moths” sub-index recorded the biggest decline, slumping 19% to be down more than 30% since June.
“From a policy perspective the next major event will be the Commonwealth budget which will be announced on Oct 6,” Evans said. “The government’s forecasts for economic growth will be key inputs to budget decisions, including decisions around the need for further stimulus.”

The figures reflect sales at over 62,000 stores across Mexico, including at chains such as Soriana and Chedraui, that have been open for at least a year. In June, same store sales fell by 17.9% from the same month a year earlier.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 11:32AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices rebound in July; trend remains weak amid fragile demand,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased by the most in more than 1-1/2 years in July, but the overall trend in producer inflation remained subdued amid signs the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession was faltering.
The jump in producer prices reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday, however, further diminished the risk of deflation, a decline in the general price level. Deflation is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices. 
Overall, benign inflation should allow the Federal Reserve to maintain its extraordinarily easy monetary policy as it tries to nurse the economy back to health.
""Fed officials will see no reason to be on high alert for inflation pressures after today's modest rebound in producer prices and there is little reason for them to temper their highly stimulative monetary policy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The producer price index for final demand increased 0.6% last month, driven by a surge in portfolio management fees and rising costs for gasoline. That was the biggest gain since October 2018 and followed a 0.2% decline in June. 
In the 12 months through July, the PPI dropped 0.4% after falling 0.8% in the 12 months through June. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would rise 0.3% in July and decrease 0.7% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices increased 0.3% last month after a similar rise in June. In the 12 months through July, the core PPI edged up 0.1%. The core PPI ticked down 0.1% on a year-on-year basis in June.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 0.9% on a year-on-year basis in June. July's core PCE price index data will be released later this month.
There is little scope for inflation to heat up as the economy continues to take a hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. A separate report on Tuesday showed small business confidence relapsed in July, with owners tempering their economic expectations over the next six months. 
Small businesses noted that ""sales are often lower due to business restrictions, social distancing requirements, and a still-reduced willingness of consumers to go out and mingle with the general population.""
PORTFOLIO FEES JUMP
Coronavirus infections have soared across the United States, forcing authorities in some of the worst-affected areas to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, sending workers back home. 
The government reported last Friday that the economy created 1.763 million jobs in July after a record rise of 4.791 million in June. Only 9.3 million of 22 million jobs lost between February and April have been recouped. At least 31.3 million people are on unemployment benefits.
The economy, which entered recession in February, suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher, with the S&P 500 index closing in on a record high, as investors bet on more stimulus measures. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were down. 
Last month, wholesale food prices fell 0.5% as the cost of meat dropped 8.0%. Food prices decreased 5.2% in June. Wholesale gasoline prices increased 10.1% after advancing 26.3% in June. Goods prices shot up 0.8%. That followed a 0.2% rise in June. 
Excluding food and energy, goods prices climbed 0.3% in July after inching up 0.1% in the prior month. 
The cost of services rebounded 0.5%, the largest gain since April 2019, after dropping 0.3% in June. A 0.4% increase in the prices for services, excluding trade, transportation, and warehousing, accounted for about 60% of last month's rise.
Margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, advanced 0.8%. A 7.8% surge in portfolio fees was also a major contributor to the acceleration in the costs of services. 
That reflected a stock market rally and followed a 2.2% advance in June. But prices for airline tickets fell 7.0%. The cost of motel and hotel accommodation also declined. The cost of healthcare services increased 0.4%. 
Those airline tickets, healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index.

""Weaker demand should exert downward pressure on prices overall, keeping a sustained return to and overshoot of 2% unlikely for some time,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

36,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 09:21AM ET</span>","UK job losses hit decade-high, worse seen ahead","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people in work in Britain has suffered the biggest drop since 2009 and signs are growing that the coronavirus will take a heavier toll on the labour market as the government winds down its huge job-protection scheme.
Led by a record plunge in the self-employed, 220,000 fewer people were working in the three months through June, official figures showed on Tuesday.
Separate tax data for July showed that the number of staff on company payrolls had fallen by 730,000 since March, sounding the alarm about a potentially much bigger rise in joblessness.
Mounting job losses are expected as Britain winds down its job-retention scheme, which has covered around one in three private-sector jobs. It is due to close at the end of October.
""A real concern is that this is just the first wave of bad news for the jobs market,"" said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development.
""The fact that reduced hiring rather than increased firing of permanent staff is the main cause of the jobs slowdown to date bodes ill for the coming months if more employers turn to redundancies as a last resort.""
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said the government's support programmes were working but job losses were inevitable.
""I've always been clear that we can't protect every job, but ... we have a clear plan to protect, support and create jobs to ensure that nobody is left without hope,"" he said.
A string of companies plan layoffs, ranging from British Airways (L:ICAG) and London's Evening Standard newspaper to retailers WH Smith (L:SMWH) and Selfridges.
The unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 3.9%. But that reflected more people who had given up looking for work and therefore were not considered unemployed, and 300,000 people who said they were working but getting no pay, the Office for National Statistics said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the unemployment rate to rise to 4.2%. Last week, the Bank of England forecast the jobless rate would hit 7.5% at the end of this year.
BoE Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden told The Times the central bank still had ""significant headroom"" to ramp up its huge bond-buying stimulus programme again if needed.
The ONS is expected to announce on Wednesday that Britain's economy has fallen into a recession with a 21% slump in the size of the economy in the second quarter.
Tuesday's figures showed the number of self-employed people fell by a record amount in the three months to June, led by older workers. The number of employees rose - something the ONS said was partly accounted for by workers reclassifying themselves as employed.
The number of people claiming universal credit - a benefit for those on low pay as well as the unemployed - rose to 2.689 million in July, leaping by 117% from March. 
Pay fell by the most in more than 10 years in the April-June period, down 1.2%, reflecting how workers on the job retention scheme receive 80% of their salary. Excluding bonuses, pay fell for the first time since records began in 2001.

However, there was a small increase in job vacancies in the three months to July as small businesses took on staff to meet coronavirus guidelines, the ONS said.

The group’s index of sentiment decreased by 1.8 points to 98.8, reversing course after two months of gains. The measure remains well below the pre-pandemic 2020 high of 104.5. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a reading of 100.5. The NFIB’s measure of sales expectations in the next three months fell 8 points in July to a net 5%.
Some states paused or rolled back their reopenings during the month as the virus continued to rage around the U.S. While the unemployment rate fell in July, small businesses continued to be disproportionately hit by the virus.  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) Inc. reported in July that more than half of the business closures that were temporary at the beginning of the pandemic are now permanent.
“This summer has been challenging for many small-business owners who are working hard to keep their doors open and remain in business,” Bill Dunkelberg, NFIB chief economist, said in a statement. “There is still plenty of work to be done to get businesses back to pre-crisis numbers.”
Five of the 10 subindexes in the small-business optimism index lost ground in July, and the group’s uncertainty index increased 7 points to 88. An index of those firms expecting better business conditions in the next six months dropped 14 points to a net 25%.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 11, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",German investor sentiment improves in August as recovery hopes rise,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Investor sentiment in Germany picked up more than expected in August, a ZEW survey showed on Tuesday, reflecting hopes that Europe's biggest economy is on the road to recovery after the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The ZEW survey of investors' economic sentiment rose to 71.5 from 59.3 points the previous month, far exceeding a forecast for 58.0 in a Reuters poll of economists. 
""Hopes for a speedy economic recovery have continued to grow,"" said ZEW President Achim Wambach. 
Experts were much more downbeat about current conditions, however. The index tracking those dropped to -81.3 points from -80.9 the previous month. That compared with a Reuters consensus forecast of -68.8 points. 
The German economy shrank by 10.1% in the second quarter, its steepest rate on record as consumer spending, company investment and exports collapsed at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, wiping out nearly 10 years of growth.
Wambach said assessments from individual sectors showed that experts expect a general recovery, especially in domestic sectors. ""However, the still very poor earnings expectations for the banking sector and insurers regarding the coming six months give cause for concern,"" he added.
The government hopes its more than 130 billion euro ($153.17 billion) stimulus package will help a return to growth. It expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year and expand 5.2% in 2021.
""Signs of a strong economic recovery in the summer are continuing,"" said LBBW economist Uwe Burkert. ""However, the danger of an expectation bubble, triggered by massive fiscal and monetary policy impulses, which mainly boost financial markets, is not off the table,"" he added.

The hardest-hit sectors were hotels and hospitality, the auto sector and tour operators, it said.
""The broad use of short-time working due to the coronavirus pandemic had a negative impact on the level and development of gross monthly earnings and working hours,"" the Office said in a statement.
It added, however, that the short-time work programme, under which employees temporarily work shorter hours but keep their jobs while the state makes up the shortfall, cushioned the loss of income for employees to a large extent. 
The Ifo institute said last week that the number of people in Germany on short-time work had fallen to 5.6 million.

Hourly earnings before tax were not hit by short-time work, rising 2.6% on average in the second quarter from the same period last year, said the Office.

The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions grew 2.3 points to 41.1 from June. The index hit a record low in April.

The Cabinet Office, in its assessment, said the index is picking up but worries over the coronavirus have been growing.

The number of payroll jobs nationwide eased 0.1% in July while Victoria recorded a fall of 1.5% as strict mobility restrictions and curfews came into effect, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed.
""With stage four restrictions now in effect, we anticipate further job losses across (Victoria), particularly in vulnerable sectors such as hospitality and retail,"" said Callam Pickering, an economist at global job site Indeed. ""Recovery won't be possible until restrictions are eased.""
The release, an experimental series, differs from the monthly official employment data and is based on wage payment figures from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
The monthly figures, due later this week, are expected to show a jump in the national jobless rate to a 22-year high of 7.8% even though employment is expected to rise by 40,000, according to a median forecast of economists in a Reuters poll.
Australia had seen a surge in jobs growth in the past couple of months as authorities largely managed to control the spread of the virus and began re-opening the economy. That helped recoup many of the jobs lost due the coronavirus.
Tuesday's data showed payroll jobs still remained 4.5% below mid-March, when Australia recorded its 100th confirmed COVID-19 case.
Other data also pointed to the hit to Victoria from the renewed wave of coronavirus infections.
A measure of Australian business conditions rose in July though confidence was badly hit in Victoria.

A separate weekly survey of consumer confidence from ANZ also out on Tuesday showed sentiment had slipped for a seventh straight week as the latest lockdown took a heavy toll on Victorians.

National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) index of business conditions bounced to 0 in July, from -8 in June. That was up from a low of -34 in April at the height of the pandemic and nearer to the long-run average of +6.
However, the survey's measure of business confidence fell back to -14 in July, from 0 in June, though it remained well above the April trough of -46.
The index of sales firmed to +1, from -6, and profitability to +2 from -8. Employment improved to -2, from -11 in June.
""Conditions have now recovered to be broadly around their pre-COVID level with improvements across the country,"" said NAB Group Chief Economist Alan Oster.
""The fall in confidence even prior to the announcement of stage 4 restrictions in Melbourne demonstrates that businesses will remain very cautious given the great uncertainty around the virus at the moment.""
A weekly survey of consumer confidence from ANZ out on Tuesday showed sentiment had slipped for a seventh straight week as the latest lockdown took a heavy toll on Victorians.
Its main index fell 2.4% last week to its lowest since late April, though it was still above the record low hit that month.
The bank also noted spending on its cards last week fell 12% in Victoria compared to a year ago, even as it climbed 17% in the rest of the country.
The pandemic has wreaked havoc on two of Australia's most lucrative sectors, tourism and education, with the Reserve Bank of Australia warning economic output could contract by 6% this year in the first recession since the early 1990s.
The central bank has chopped interest rates to an all-time low of 0.25% and launched a major bond-buying campaign to hold yields down, while the government has pledged over A$200 billion ($142.98 billion) in fiscal stimulus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan posted its smallest current account surplus in more than five years in June, Ministry of Finance data showed on Tuesday, mainly due to a slump in exports, highlighting the heavy hit to external demand from the coronavirus pandemic.
The current account surplus was 167.5 billion yen ($1.58 billion), the smallest monthly surplus since January 2015, a finance ministry official said.
That compared with a median forecast for a 110 billion yen surplus and a 1.177 trillion yen surplus in May. The current account balance has maintained a run of uninterrupted monthly surpluses for six years.
Exports plunged 25.7% in June from a year ago, hit hard by falling shipments of cars and car parts to the United States, the data showed. That was slightly smaller than a 28.9% annual decline in May.
Imports shed an annual 14.4%, following a 27.7% annual fall in May. As a result, the trade deficit in June widened to 157.7 billion yen.
A 99.9% drop in foreign tourists due to immigration restrictions imposed over the health crisis sent the travel account to a 157.7 billion yen deficit in June, the data showed.
Weakening overseas demand has raised worries of a prolonged downturn for the world's third-largest economy, with some analysts seeing the impact from the COVID-19 crisis on corporate and household sentiment lasting into next year.
A Reuters poll showed analysts expect gross domestic product data, due to be released on Monday, to show the economy shrank an annualised 27.2% in the second quarter.
Japan's economic activity has picked up in recent months after the government lifted a coronavirus-related state of emergency at the end of May. But the virus has made a worrying revival, especially in highly populated areas.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese bank lending hit a record high in July as regional lenders continued to boost loans to small firms hit by the coronavirus pandemic, central bank data showed on Tuesday.
But the annual pace of increase in major banks' lending slowed as funding demand from big firms eased, suggesting that the wall of money printed by the Bank of Japan has helped address immediate corporate funding strains.
Total lending by banks and ""shinkin"" credit unions rose 6.3% in July compared with a year earlier, hitting a record 572.7 trillion yen, ($5.40 trillion) and accelerating from a 6.2% gain in June, BOJ data showed.
It was the fastest pace of growth since comparable data became available in 2001.
Major banks' lending was up 7.8% in July, slowing from a 8.6% gain in June. Lending by regional banks grew 5.1%, accelerating from a 4.7% increase in June and matching a record high in 1991, the data showed.
""Big firms' fund demand seems to have run its course. Some borrowers are also shifting to commercial paper and corporate bonds in raising funds,"" a BOJ official told reporters.
""Lending to smaller firms continues to rise as borrowers tap cheap loans with government guarantees, though the pace of increase will likely slow ahead,"" the official said.
The widespread fallout from the health crisis is tipping Japan into deep recession, having forced the government to compile a huge stimulus package and the BOJ to ease policy in March and April.
Private financial institutions have played a key role in channelling money to the economy by following government requests to offer loans against no collateral to cash-strapped firms, most of which would be backed by government guarantees.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers spent the most last month since the country went into a coronavirus lockdown in March, as pubs, restaurants, barbers and beauty salons reopened, according to industry figures published on Tuesday.
Data from Barclaycard and the British Retail Consortium showed spending was close to getting back to normal levels though not all sectors were benefiting.
Barclaycard said consumer spending was 2.6% lower than in July 2019, the smallest shortfall since the lockdown began.
""However, a sense of cautiousness still prevails,"" Barclaycard director Esme Harwood said. 
Official figures due on Wednesday are expected to show Britain suffered the biggest economic hit from COVID-19 of any major economy between April and June with output expected to be down by about 20%.
While unemployment has barely risen so far, due largely to a government job protection scheme, the Bank of England expects the jobless rate to almost double to 7.5% by the end of 2020.
Reopening businesses, as well as warm weather, boosted consumer spending in July. But sales at pubs and restaurants, which reopened for on-premises consumption on July 4, remained well below year-ago levels. 
By contrast, sales of takeaways and fast food were 20% higher than last year as people preferred to eat at home - something finance minister Rishi Sunak is trying to change with government subsidies for dining in restaurants in August.
Spending on groceries, furniture and electronics was also up strongly, while travel spending remained week.
Figures from the British Retail Consortium - which only cover shopping - painted a similar picture for July.
Total retail spending across the BRC's members - mostly large chains - was 3.2% higher than a year earlier, close to June's 3.4% rise, the biggest increase since May 2018.

""The strongest performance came from food, furniture and homeware, as consumers increasingly invest in their time at home. However many shops, particularly in fashion, jewellery and beauty, are still struggling to survive,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings increased in June but the surge in vacancies was accompanied by a rise in workers quitting their positions at hotels, restaurants and bars, likely because of fears of exposure to COVID-19 and problems securing child care. 
Despite the increase in vacancies reported by the Labor Department on Monday, job openings remained below their pre-pandemic level, supporting the view that it could take the labor market years to recover from the public health crisis.
""Perhaps the rise in job openings is less about adding additional workers, but backfilling positions from workers who quit positions due to concerns about the virus, lack of childcare options, or similar reasons,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. 
""An increase in quitting is usually a sign of worker confidence in the health of the labor market. Right now, it's hard to see workers feeling quite so confident with unemployment in the double digits.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 518,000 to 5.9 million on the last day of June, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. Vacancies were below their level of 7 million in February. 
There were an additional 198,000 job openings in the accommodation and food services industry. Vacancies also increased in the health care and social assistance sector. Overall, the job openings rate rose to 4.1% from 3.9% in May.
The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs increased 531,000 to 2.6 million. Those quitting jobs in the healthcare and social assistance industry rose by 106,000, while the jump in the accommodation and food services sector was 104,000. The retail sector saw an increase of 99,000 quitting.
The quits rate, which under normal circumstance is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, increased to 1.9% from 1.6% in May.
SCANT JOB OPPORTUNITIES
The JOLTS report followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy created 1.763 million jobs in July, decelerating from a record 4.791 million in June. The economy has regained 9.3 million of the 22 million jobs lost between February and April. There were 16.3 million unemployed last month, though 31.3 million were on jobless benefits in mid-July.
With June's vacancies, there were three people per job opening.
""Opportunities to find work as unemployment benefits have been reduced, however, remain relatively scant, with three unemployed workers for every job opening,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
A $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement expired at the end of July. President Donald Trump on Saturday signed an executive order to extend the supplement, though he reduced the weekly check to $400.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher. The dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
The JOLTS report showed hiring dropped by 503,000 jobs to 6.7 million in June. Hiring was still at the second highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2000. 
Hiring fell in the health care and social assistance sector, as well as in construction. It rose by 255,000 in professional and business services, and 78,000 in accommodation and food services.
Overall, the hiring rate fell to 4.9% from an all-time high of 5.4% in May.

""Another day, another labor market statistic that just doesn't make sense,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Incredibly, bars, restaurants, and hotels want to hire 719,000 workers in June where before the pandemic shut down the country they wanted to hire 815,000. Biggest recession in almost a century and there is no change in the hiring plans of leisure and hospitality industries.""

The shift reflects the effects of fresh restrictions enacted by state and local governments to combat a resurgence in coronavirus infections. U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in July, reflecting a potential slowdown in the economic rebound. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.8 million jobs last month, compared to the record 4.8 million jobs added in June, the Labor Department said on Friday. 
Consumers said the mean perceived probability of losing their job over the next year increased to 16% in July from 15% in June, above the 2019 average of 14.3%, according to the New York Fed survey.
The mean expectation that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher in a year started rising again in July after falling for three straight months from the series high of 50.9% reached in March. Consumers put the odds at 39.3% in July, up from 35.1% in June.
People with jobs remained likely to stay put with their employers. The average probability that a worker would leave his job voluntarily was unchanged at 18.9%, below last year's average of 21%. 
Inflation expectations rose slightly in July, with the median expectation for the next year rising to 2.9% from 2.7% in June. The median inflation expectations for the next three years rose to 2.7% in July from 2.5% in June. Consumers below age 40 reported the biggest increases in inflation expectations.

The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

Sentiment in Germany picked up for a fourth straight month, with investors feeling more upbeat about both the current situation and the future. Sentix suggested this may be linked to a surge in industrial orders in June.

Month on month inflation increased to 0.4% in July from 0.1% in June mainly on the back of an increase in electricity and energy prices, the agency said.
Allen Sandeep, head of research at Naeem Brokerage, called the fall in the annual rate a ""positive surprise"", highlighting a 0.9% monthly drop in the price of food. 
Consumer demand ahead of and during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which fell on July 31, had slowed likely due to concerns over spending at a time of uncertainty, Sandeep said. 
July's inflation rate however remained well below the central bank's target of 9% plus or minus three percentage points.
At its last monetary policy meeting, the central bank held the overnight lending rate at 10.25% and the overnight deposit rate at 9.25%.
""We still feel that Egypt's central bank will hold its horses for a couple of months as we see through all the effects of the pandemic,"" Sandeep said. 

Egypt's economy was hit hard by the coronavirus lockdown that paralysed tourism and other vital sectors, leading to a cut in growth forecasts for the 2019/2020 fiscal year to 4.2% from 5.6% prior to the crisis.

Investing.com – China saw its factory deflation ease in July, as the global economy shows signs of a slow recovery to pre-COVID-19 levels.
The National Bureau of Statistics said earlier in the day that July’s consumer price index rose 2.7% and 0.6% year-on-year and month-on-month respectively, whilst the producer price index decreased 2.4% year-on-year. All three readings beat forecasts prepared by Investing.com as well as June’s figures.
Chinese industrial output is on a steady march back towards pre-pandemic levels, with iron ore future prices in the city of Dalian rallying over 50% so far in 2020.
Analysts say China's industrial output is steadily returning to levels seen before the pandemic paralyzed huge swathes of the economy, as pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports propel a recovery.
But some investors warned that cautious consumer spending and the ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases could stall economic recovery. Heavy rainfall has also led to floods in several parts of the country, hampering production.
“The acceleration in China’s consumer price inflation is likely to be short-lived, despite its pickup in July. Food price inflation would probably soften toward year-end, which, together with still-sluggish household demand, could exert downward pressure to the headline CPI. We expect the pace of decline in producer prices to continue to narrow but remain in deflation over the course of the year,” David Qu, Bloomberg’s China Economist, said in a note.
Investors will be looking to further data, including industrial production, due to be released on Friday."

The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.4% from a year earlier in July, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement on Monday, compared with a 2.5% decline tipped in a Reuters poll of analysts and a 3.0% drop in June.

Iron ore futures prices in Dalian have rallied over 50% so far this year while prices of steel bars used in construction have jumped 12%.[IRONORE/]
Prices of petroleum and natural gas extraction led the headline gains, rising 12% month-on-month, thanks to the continued rebound in global crude oil prices, according to Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS. Coal mining and automobile manufacturing prices also turned positive in July.
""A further ramp-up in fiscal stimulus should continue to shore up infrastructure spending in the coming months, supporting a further recovery in economic activity and producer prices,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
BAD WEATHER
However, PPI rose 0.4% on a monthly basis, unchanged from the increase in June, pointing to strains on construction and production work caused by recent floods in southern China. Some economists have warned the recovery could stall amid cautious consumer spending and a resurgence in global infections.
Consumer inflation also picked up up in July as the bad weather pushed food prices higher.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7% from a year earlier, its fastest pace in three months and compared with an expected 2.6% increase and a 2.5% rise in June.
It was mainly driven by surging pork prices, which rose 85.7% on a yearly basis. 
However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, rose a mere 0.5% in July from a year earlier.

""The higher-than-expected price increase will strengthen the determination of the monetary authorities to normalise policies,"" said Hu Yuexiao, chief macro analyst at Shanghai securities.

57,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Canada adds more jobs than expected in July; most were part-time positions,"By Julie Gordon and Kelsey Johnson
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada added 418,500 jobs in July, though the vast majority were part-time positions, and the unemployment rate fell to 10.9% as the economy continued to reopen from COVID-19 closures, Statistics Canada said on Friday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a gain of 400,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 11%, after record job gains in June as businesses across the country reopened.
""This is fairly close to what was expected compared to what we've seen in the last three months or so. We're settling down after the easy increases in June,"" said Douglas Porter, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal.
Employment in the goods-producing sector grew by 70,600 jobs, while the services sector grew by 347,900 positions. Part-time employment rose by 345,300 compared to 73,200 new full-time positions.
""Obviously you would rather see a more favorable full-time, part-time split,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. ""But that was also understandable given that it was the services sector driving the recovery."" 
Many restaurants and hotels continue to operate below normal capacity and retail jobs are often part-time.
StatsCan also broke out employment numbers for minority population groups for the first time in July. It found that the unemployment rate was significantly higher for South Asian, Arab and Black Canadians than the average.
""We know that the best decisions are based on the most inclusive data, and our government will continue to monitor and track how this situation is impacting Canadians from all walks of life,"" the government said in a statement.
In the United States, meanwhile, the gap in the jobless rate between whites and Blacks spread to its widest in more than five years, as employment growth slowed considerably amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections. 
The Canadian dollar  was trading 0.4% lower at 1.3360 to the greenback, or 74.85 U.S. cents, as rising trade tensions between Canada and the United States offset the job gains.
While the gains were better than expected, almost 2.2 million Canadians were jobless in July, around twice as many as in February. That means ""there is still a long way to go,"" said Ryan Brecht, senior economist at Action Economics.
""The Bank of Canada will remain in whatever-it-takes policy mode through 2021,"" Brecht added. The central bank has said interest rates will remain low for at least two years.

If those who wanted to work but did not look for a job were included as unemployed in July, the adjusted unemployment rate would have been 13.8%, StatsCan said.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",U.S. wholesale inventories decline further in June,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories fell less than initially estimated in June, likely reflecting a rebound in goods imports after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trade flows.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories decreased 1.4% in June, instead of dropping 2.0% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers fell 1.2% in May. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product dropped 1.4% in June.
Goods imports rebounded by the most in more than five years in June as trade flows improved.
The continued inventory drawdown contributed to GDP declining at a record 32.9% annualized rate in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted almost 4 percentage points from GDP, the most since the fourth quarter of 1982. Inventories have declined for five straight quarters. The economy fell into recession is February.
The decline in inventories in June was broad. Stocks of motor vehicles and parts fell 2.1%.
Sales at wholesalers surged 8.8% in June after increasing 5.7% in May. At June's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.38 months to clear shelves, down from 1.53 months in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in July amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections, offering the clearest evidence yet that the economy's recovery from the recession caused by the pandemic was faltering.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday piles pressure on the White House and Congress to reach an agreement on another aid package. Talks have been dragging over differences on major issues including the size of a government benefit for tens of millions of unemployed workers.
A $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement expired last Friday, while thousands of businesses have burned through loans offered by the government to help with wages.
""The jobs recovery is on very shaky ground and without seat belts for the unemployed provided by additional fiscal stimulus the economy could be in for a very bumpy ride,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""There cannot be sustainable economic growth if the country has to carry on with the crushing weight of massive unemployment."" 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.763 million jobs last month after a record rise of 4.791 million in June. That left payrolls 12.9 million below their pre-pandemic level. Employment peaked at 152.5 million in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.6 million jobs were added in July. Many say July was probably the last month of employment gains related to the rehiring of workers after the reopening of businesses.
The slowing labor market is more bad news for President Donald Trump, who is lagging in opinion polls behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee for the Nov. 3 election. 
The economy, which entered into recession in February, suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years. 
Infections of the respiratory illness soared across the country last month, forcing authorities in some of the worst-affected areas in the West and South to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, sending workers back home. Demand for goods and services has suffered.
Last month's slowdown in job growth occurred across all sectors, with the exception of government. The leisure and hospitality industry hired 592,000 workers, accounting for about a third of nonfarm payrolls. The bulk of the jobs were at restaurants and bars. Retail employment rose by 258,000 jobs, with almost half of the gain in clothing and accessories stores. 
Professional and business services added 170,000 jobs, concentrated in the temporary help services. Government employment increased by 301,000 in July, artificially boosted by hefty gains in state and local government education.
The model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data normally anticipates education workers to drop off payrolls in July. This, however, happened earlier because of the pandemic, leading to a big gain in July.
U.S. stocks opened lower while the dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading largely higher.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
The unemployment rate fell to 10.2% from 11.1% in June, but it has been biased downward by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the report, estimated that the jobless rate would have been 11.2% without this error. The BLS, however, cautioned that the 1 percentage point estimate ""represents the upper bound of our estimate of misclassification and probably overstates the size of the misclassification error.""
At least 31.3 million people were receiving unemployment checks in mid-July. The slowdown in hiring challenges the U.S. stock market's expectation of a V-shaped recovery. The S&P 500 index (SPX) is up nearly 50% from its March trough. As COVID-19 cases spiral, and Republicans and Democrats bicker over another stimulus package, economists see a W-shaped recovery.

Economists estimate the Paycheck Protection Program that gave businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee pay saved around 1.3 million jobs at its peak. The extra $600 weekly unemployment checks made up 20% of personal income and helped to boost consumer spending in May and June.

Last month’s hiring, which added to the 1.2 million in May and June, lowered the nation’s unemployment rate to 10.9%, from 12.3% previously. Economists predicted a July increase of 380,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 11%, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
Hourly wages climbed 5.7% in July from a year earlier. Hours worked rose 5.3% from June.
A strong third month was largely expected as provinces, particularly Ontario, moved to more aggressively reopen their economies, prompting businesses to rehire workers. Economists, however, have warned it could still take years before the labor market returns to pre-pandemic levels.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy's recovery from lockdown faltered in July, creating only 1.763 million jobs through the middle of the month, according to government data released on Friday.
Nonfarm payrolls rose by 1.763 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, down from a revised 4.791 million in the month through mid-June. A broad range of forecasts ahead of the report had generated an average estimate of 1.60 million jobs created.
With the headline number falling relatively close to the average forecast, the initial impact on markets was small. The US 500 Futures contract, which has been zeroing in on a new record high this week, edged only 4 points higher, less than 0.1%, on the news. The euro pared earlier losses, rising a quarter of a cent to $1.1840 by 8:45 AM ET (1245 GMT), but still well within the day's trading range.
Marc Chandler, managing director of Bannockburn Global Forex, said the dollar had needed a ""much stronger"" number to turn market sentiment which has been solidly against it this week, driving the dollar index to a series of two-year lows. 
The unemployment rate fell to 10.2% of the working population, from 11.1% in June. That's below a consensus forecast of 10.5%.
The softening of the labor market was in part due to the second wave of coronavirus infections that spread through the South and West of the U.S. during the month, leading states such as California, Texas, and Florida to pause and even reverse some of the measures they had previously announced to reopen their economies.
The still-high number of unemployed - figures released on Thursday showed over 31 million Americans claiming either statutory unemployment benefits or the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits in the week through July 25 - has gained in importance since the Congressional approval for enhanced unemployment benefits expired at the end of July. Negotiators from the Republican-led Senate and the Democrat-led House of Representatives have been unable so far to agree on a compromise that would extend the benefits. Analysts warn that failure to extend would result in a sharp drop in household consumption.
""Total employment remains 13 million down on February level,"" said Panmure Gordon chief economist Simon French via Twitter. He pointed out that the broader 'U6' classification of unemployed and underemployed was still running at over 17% of the workforce. 
The government's data meanwhile also showed a fresh decline in the labor force participation rate to 61.4% from 61.5% in June. That suggests that more Americans have stopped actively looking for work given the lack of opportunities since the coronavirus epidemic exploded.  The participation rate had hit a multi-year high of 63.4% in February and dropped to a low of 60.2% in April.

Exports rose 0.4% from a year earlier to $28.2 billion in July, the finance ministry said on Friday. A Reuters poll had forecast an annual drop of 0.22%. In June, exports slipped 3.8%
The ministry said the ""stay-at-home economy"", where millions of people worked from home to curb the spread of the coronavirus, boosted exports of telecommuting products such as laptops which jumped 18.5% from a year earlier to a record high. 
Beatrice Tsai, head of the ministry's statistics department, expected exports in the second half to decline slightly from a year earlier, citing the impact from the pandemic. 
Uncertainties remain for exports in the second half as strong technology demand for products such as semiconductors could be offset by the pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions, the ministry said. 
Taiwan's July imports fell 6.8% against economists' expectations for a 3.1% decline.
Tech powerhouse Taiwan, whose largest trading partner is China, could see August exports come in within a range of -2.5% to -0.5% on the year, Tsai said.
In China, exports also confounded expectations by rising at the fastest pace in seven months in July.
While Taiwan has had relatively fewer coronavirus infections and managed to avoid a lockdown of its economy, the government has repeatedly warned of economic uncertainties and is rolling out a stimulus package worth T$1.05 trillion ($35.7 billion).
The island's economy recorded its deepest contraction in nearly 11 years in the second quarter, as the pandemic dampened tourism although global demand for its tech exports helped counter the slowdown.

Industrial output from Europe's largest economy grew 8.9% on the month, fueled in part by a 14.9% increase in exports - the largest month-on-month increase in almost 30 years.
Germany's automotive industry recorded a 54.7% increase in output over the previous month, though volumes were still 20% lower than in February, the last month before the pandemic struck.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy appeared to be gathering pace in July as exports rose the most this year while some raw material imports hit record highs, adding to hopes for a more sustained recovery.
The economy is gradually emerging from a record contraction in the first quarter but the recovery remains fragile as rising coronavirus cases around the world and renewed lockdowns could hit demand. Chinese consumer spending also remained subdued amid job losses and concerns about a resurgence in infections.
The country's export performance, however, has not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared, while signs of stabilisation in the domestic economy have reduced the urgency for more stimulus.
Exports in July increased 7.2% from a year earlier, the fastest pace since December last year, customs data showed on Friday, confounding analysts' expectations for a 0.2% drop and quickening from a 0.5% increase in June. 
Imports, on the other hand, fell 1.4%, missing market expectations for a 1.0% increase.
""The data is in line with our forecast for exports to recover more decisively in H2 alongside the global economy,"" Tommy Wu, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note, adding that external demand for other products, besides medical supplies, will recover gradually as global industrial production starts picking up.
""However, the road ahead may be bumpy as new export orders remain weak and the recovery path will be uneven across economies."" 
January-July exports of textile products, including face masks, rose 31.3% y/y, quickening from a 27.8% expansion in the first half. Growth of sales in medical equipment also picked up to 47.3% from 41.4%.
But in a sign that global demand may be stabilising, exports of other goods such as electronicss and mobile phones increased while declines in furniture and toys moderated, the data showed 
DIP IN IMPORTS
Analysts attributed the year-on-year dip in July imports to weaker commodities prices and payback following strong shipments the previous year.
They are optimistic that a ramp-up in infrastructure projects on the back of policy support will lift import growth. Imports rose 4.9% in July on a monthly basis. 
""With credit growth still accelerating, China's stimulus-led recovery looks set to continue in the coming months, supporting a further rebound in imports,"" said Martin Rasmussen, China Economist, at Capital Economics. 
Import volumes of industrial raw materials remained robust, with record imports of iron ore and copper, along with a sharp jump in crude oil.
The country's trade surplus for July stood at $62.33 billion, up from a surplus of $46.42 billion in June.
A risk for China's trade outlook this year is heightening U.S.-China tensions which are expected to escalate ahead of the United State's presidential election. 
The country's trade surplus with the United States widened to $32.46 billion in July from $29.41 billion in June. 
China's imports from the United States in July rose 3.6% from a year earlier, slowing from a 11.3% gain in June. In January-July, imports fell 3.5%, falling short of the commitments made in the Phase 1 trade deal to increase purchases of American goods. 

Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are set to review the implementation of the Phase 1 trade deal and likely air mutual grievances during a video conference on Aug. 15.

Investing.com – China reported that July’s exports rose at their fastest pace in seven months, but imports declined in the same month, leaving investors with a mixed picture of the Chinese economy’s recovery from COVID-19.
Customs data showed that exports increased 7.2% year-on-year, against June’s growth of 0.5% and predictions of a 0.2% slide prepared by Investing.com. Meanwhile, imports decreased 1.4% year-on-year, compared to June’s 2.7% and missed expectations of a 1% increase.
The country’s trade balance for July increased to $62.33 billion, compared to June’s $46.42 billion and exceeding the forecasted $42 billion.

“However, the road ahead may be bumpy as new export orders remain weak and the recovery path will be uneven across economies,” he warned.
Although the economy is slowly recovering after seeing a record contraction during the first quarter, the never-ceasing number of COVID-19 cases globally has impacted demand. The government is also dealing with record job losses and fresh outbreaks within the country.
But exports of medical supplies and demand for electronics, contributed to the meteoric growth in exports. July also saw robust imports of iron ore and copper, along with a jump in crude oil imports.

“Consumer perception of the prevailing economic situation, employment scenario and own income was significantly lower than that in May,” the RBI said in the report. “Most respondents reported a reduction in discretionary spending” and didn’t expect to increase non-essential spending in the coming year as well, it said.
At the same time inflation expectations of households are rising, a separate report showed, making it difficult for the RBI to cut interest rates in coming months to spur spending. On Thursday, the six-member monetary policy committee voted unanimously to keep its main policy rate unchanged, given the recent surge in inflation to above the central bank’s 2%-6% target range.
There was a glimmer of hope in the sentiment survey though, with consumers turning cautiously optimistic about the coming year. The survey is conducted in over 13 Indian cities and covers more than 5000 households."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits fell last week, but a staggering 31.3 million people were receiving unemployment checks in mid-July, suggesting the labor market was stalling as the country battles a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases that is threatening a budding economic recovery.
Other data on Thursday showed a 54% surge in job cuts announced by employers in July. The reports followed on the heels of news this week of a sharp step-down in private payrolls in July and continued declines in employment at manufacturing and services industries.
""Repeated shutdowns for virus containment remain a threat to the labor market, which is already weak,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Without effective virus containment the recovery remains at risk from ongoing job losses that could further restrain incomes and spending.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 249,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.186 million for the week ended Aug. 1, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March. Claims remain well above the peak of 695,000 during the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.415 million applications in the latest week. 
Coronavirus cases soared across the country last month, forcing authorities in some of the hard-hit areas in the West and South to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, sending workers back home. Though infections have eased about 5% nationally, they jumped last week in Oklahoma, Montana, Missouri and 17 other states. 
The public health crisis is hurting demand for goods and services, broadening layoffs to sectors of the economy that were not initially impacted when nonessential businesses like restaurants and bars were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of the respiratory illness. 
Businesses are also cautious about hiring. Claims topped out at a record 6.867 million in late March. Some economists attributed last week's drop in claims to the end of a $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement last Friday. They expected further declines in the weeks ahead. Industry groups had complained the supplement was discouraging furloughed and unemployed workers from returning to their jobs.
""The expiration of these benefits last week may have discouraged some job losers from applying, clouding the signal from the claims data,"" said Bill Adams, senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Last week, 655,707 applications were filed under the government-funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for gig workers and the self-employed among others, who do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance. That was down 253,093 from the prior week.
Other economists, however, expected claims to remain elevated because of weak demand and the expiration of the U.S. government's Paycheck Protection Program that gave businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee pay.
Stocks on Wall Street dipped as investors awaited the government's new stimulus package to prop up the economy. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED 
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid totaled 16.107 million in the week ending July 25, from 16.951 million in the prior week. A total 31.3 million people were receiving unemployment benefits under all programs in the week ending July 18, up 492,816 from the prior week.
Economists said the tens of millions of unemployed workers underscored the need for another aid package. The White House and Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress are working on the next wave of relief.
""Today's jobless claims are an ominous sign that many Americans are unable to get back to work after the coronavirus lockdown of the economy earlier this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""There aren't enough dollars flowing through the economy to help keep it growing if the government stops its support.""
The claims report has no bearing on July's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed businesses and households for the nonfarm payrolls tally and unemployment rate.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 1.58 million in July, down sharply from the record 4.8 million jobs created in June. The jobless rate is forecast to fall to 10.5% from 11.1% in June. 
But July job growth could surprise on the downside. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed the small business recovery stalling in July, with activity declining in areas hardest hit by the coronavirus. The Census Bureau's Household Pulse survey implied job losses.

A report on Thursday from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S. employers surged 54% to 262,649 in July. Hiring announcements totaled 246,507 last month.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits fell to 1.186 million last week, after two straight weeks of increases, amid concerns the recovery in the labor market is losing momentum amid a resurgence in Covid-19 cases.
The number is the lowest weekly total for initial claims since late March, when layoffs around the country exploded due to lockdown orders. Economists had forecast a more modest decline to 1.415 million.
The Labor Department's data also showed a big drop in the number of people making an initial claim for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits, which fell by over 253,000 to just under 656,000 last week. 
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased to 16.107 million, the lowest since late April. The previous week's figure was also revised downwards to 1.951 million. However, the overall number of people claiming for unemployment assistance - including two specific programs related to the pandemic - rose by nearly half a million to 31.31 million.
The data comes as Congressional Democrats and White House officials continue talks to reach a compromise on a new coronavirus relief bill, but the two sides remain sharply divided on several issues including the size of a federal benefit for tens of millions of unemployed Americans.
Investors were looking ahead to the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report for July on Friday.
That report is expected to show 1.6 million jobs were added last month, slowing sharply from a record 4.8 million in June. The report covers the period through mid-July, before containment measures were reintroduced in some states in the second half of the month.
Data from payrolls processor ADP on Wednesday showed that U.S. private sector hiring increased by just 167,000 in July, falling far short of forecasts for 1.5 million jobs to be added. However, ADP also revised its estimate of job gains in June sharply higher."

It was the lowest jobless rate since June 2011 but the highest reading in the last nine months.
Seasonally adjusted data showed the number of unemployed at 764,912 people, with those aged up to 24 bearing the brunt of being out of work.
Among younger persons aged 15 to 24, the jobless rate rose to 37.5% from 32.2% in the same month in 2019. Greece's jobless rate, which hit a record high of 27.8% in September 2013, had been falling since but remains the highest in the euro zone.
Greece's 2020 budget projected growth picking up this year, helping to drive joblessness down to 15.6% but a government-imposed lockdown to stem the spread of the new coronavirus pandemic has thrown forecasts off.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine economy fell into recession for the first time in 29 years with a record slump in the second quarter, as strict lockdown measures ravaged economic activity and prompted the government to sharply cut its GDP forecast for 2020.
Official data showed on Thursday gross domestic product  tumbling 16.5% in April-June from a year earlier - the biggest slump since comparable GDP data was first recorded in 1981 - after falling a revised 0.7% in the first quarter.
The drop was far bigger than the 9% contraction forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and made the Philippines the second country in Southeast Asia, after Singapore, to fall into recession amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Domestic demand and business investment were severely hit, data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed, while the government was now forecasting the biggest annual drop in GDP since 1985 this year. It reimposed restrictions in and around Manila this week to fight a rise in coronavirus cases.
""The Philippine economy crash-landed into recession with the Q2 GDP meltdown showcasing the destructive impact of lockdowns on the consumption-dependent economy,"" said ING senior economist Nicholas Antonio Mapa.
Seasonally adjusted GDP fell 15.2% in the second quarter from the first three months of the year, while the government sharply downgraded its 2020 growth forecast.
The Philippines was among Asia's fastest-growing economies before the pandemic, but now the government expects its GDP to shrink 5.5% this year - the biggest annual drop in 35 years - from a previous forecast for a 2.0-3.4% decline. The government sees the economy rebounding in 2021 and 2022.
The government has allocated some 655 billion pesos ($13.35 billion) to help people face the pandemic and 59 billion pesos to improve the healthcare system, but this has done little to ease the pain of a population facing record-high unemployment.
Jomar Santos, who used to earn 350 pesos ($7.14) a day delivering school supplies to stores in Caloocan city, has been at home since the lockdown resumed on Tuesday for the next two weeks and worries about his wife and one-year old child.
""It's really very hard. No work, no food to eat,"" said the 23-year-old Jomar Santos.
""There's nothing we can do except to bear it. That's better than me and my family getting sick.""
The stock market (PSI) largely shrugged off the data and rose 1.2%, having already underperformed its regional peers this year. The local currency  closed slightly firmer at 49.05 to the dollar from Wednesday's 49.075.
WORSE OVER?
Pressure is mounting on the government to deliver more far-reaching support, given the central bank has already cut interest rates to record lows this year and that economists see little room for more monetary easing as inflation rises.
""The worst is behind us, but we're not out of the woods yet,"" Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said on Thursday.
The central bank has slashed interest rates by a total of 175 basis points this year to a record low of 2.25%.
Michael Ricafort, economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp said it is ""fundamentally tougher to further cut local policy rates at the moment"" when inflation is at a six-month high of 2.7% in July, above the central bank's key interest rate.

Instead, policy support will have to come from further reductions in banks' reserve requirement ratio, which would inject liquidity into the market, or more government stimulus, economists said.

76,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","UK construction activity jumps in July, but jobs at risk: PMI","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction industry grew at the fastest rate in almost five years in July as business picked up after COVID-related shutdowns, survey data showed on Thursday, mirroring a rapid rebound in manufacturing and parts of the services sector.
However, the sector has a long way to go before output returns to pre-COVID levels, and construction firms are still shedding jobs at one the fastest rates since the global financial crisis.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 58.1 in July from 55.3 in June - slightly above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll and a sharp rebound from April's record low of 8.2.
""Survey respondents noted a boost to sales from easing lockdown measures across the UK economy and reduced anxiety about starting new projects. However, new work was still relatively thin on the ground,"" IHS Markit's economics director, Tim Moore, said.
 Taylor Wimpey  (L:TW), one of Britain's biggest house builders, said last week it expected to complete 40% fewer homes this year than in 2019.
The index represents the pace of growth, not the level of production, and the sector still has a long way to recover after construction output collapsed by more than 40% in March and April, according to official data.
Construction accounts for about 6% of Britain's economy.
July's all-sector PMI, which includes the much larger services and manufacturing sectors, rose to its highest since June 2015 at 57.1, following similarly robust services and manufacturing PMIs on Monday and Wednesday.
The acceleration in construction was dominated by a bounce in house building, with commercial and civil engineering projects slower to get off the ground, and new order growth has not caught up with the robust pace seen in February.

The employment index fell back to 35.4 from June's 41.5 - representing one of the steepest drops in job numbers since the 2008-09 financial crisis.

Ireland has opted for a more cautious easing of COVID-19 restrictions than some other parts of the bloc, and it delayed the fourth and final stage of its exit plan for a second time on Tuesday, keeping nightclubs and many pubs closed until at least the end of August.
The AIB IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services rose to 51.9 from 39.7 in June, returning above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction after sinking as low as 13.9 in April.
That was still some way below February's pre-lockdown two-year high of 59.9, and the 55.1 and 56.6 readings in July for the euro zone and neighbouring Britain respectively.
In a note of caution, the Irish survey's authors pointed to a further fall in the volume of incoming new sales, with firms supporting workloads by completing outstanding business.
Expectations for activity also stalled following a sharp rebound in June.
""New orders remained at subdued levels, while backlogs continued to decline. With demand still soft and spare capacity rising, firms continued to cut their workforces,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said.

78,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>",Italy industry output continues rebound in June,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian industrial output rose more strongly than expected in June as factories built on the exceptional surge seen in May when production resumed after coronavirus lockdown measures were eased, data on Thursday showed.
Statistics agency ISTAT reported an 8.2% rise in industrial production in June from the month before, compared with a median forecast of a 5.1% rise in a Reuters survey of 19 analysts.
The rise followed a revised 41.6% jump in May, as the coronavirus lockdown was first lifted, and a drop of 20.5% in April, when most factories were shut down.
On a workday adjusted year-on-year basis, output was still down 13.7% in June, following a revised 20.5% fall in May and a 43.4% drop in April.
There were single digit rises in consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products.
Overall economic output in the eurozone's third-largest economy contracted sharply during the lockdown with gross domestic product down 12.4% in the second quarter, ISTAT reported last week. However the fall was less severe than many economists had predicted.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2020 03:41AM ET</span>",German industrial orders surge in fresh sign of recovery,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Orders for German-made goods rose sharply in June in the latest sign that Europe's largest economy is starting to shrug off the effects of months of lockdown, but volumes were still far below pre-pandemic levels, according to Statistics Office data.
Orders rose an adjusted 27.9% compared to the previous month, more than double May's 10.4% expansion, and far ahead of economists' forecast of 10.1%. Orders were still 11.3% below the level of February, the last pre-crisis month, though.
The recovery, led by domestic demand, is still fragile, as was underlined by a poll Der Spiegel magazine published on Thursday that showed four-fifths of Germans expect further lockdowns to control the coronavirus pandemic, with half of them expecting future measures to be more severe.
But even with those caveats, some economists were jubilant.
""The number came in so far ahead of expectations that we can almost call it a breakthrough,"" said the LBBW bank's Jens-Oliver Niklasch. ""Of course there are concerns about a second lockdown, but this number is really encouraging for the second half.""
Germany's response to the pandemic has been effective by European standards, managing to keep infection and death rates relatively low despite imposing restrictions that were both milder and shorter than in many other countries.
Domestic orders grew 35.3%, outpacing orders from abroad which expanded by 22%. The recovery in automotive orders was particularly strong, with orders rising 66.5%, though this still left them 12.2% short of February's level.
The economic impact has been softened by Germany's short-time work programme, under which employees temporarily work shorter hours, with the state making up their income shortfall.

An Ifo institute survey earlier found that numbers on short-time work were falling. The recovery was uneven, however, with toolmakers putting more people on short hours, even as working days lengthened in services, retail and automotive.

80,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 11:27PM ET</span>",Australia Third-Quarter GDP to Be Cut 2.5% by Victoria Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned the lockdown across Victoria state and even tighter measures in Melbourne to contain a Covid-19 outbreak will cut gross domestic product by 2.5% in this quarter.
“The events in Victoria are devastating,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra Thursday as he outlined Treasury’s initial estimates of the economic impact. “Devastating for the Victoria economy but also the national economy. The supply chain impact, the confidence impacts, these things are obviously impacting over states and territories.”
The prime minister estimated the unemployment rate was likely to peak closer to 10% -- as forecast by the central bank Tuesday -- rather than the 9.25% seen by Treasury in the economic update two weeks ago. The effective unemployment rate that includes workers reduced to zero hours, is now expected to climb back to nearly 14% from around 11% where it is currently, Morrison said.
The rest of Australia has isolated Victoria, shutting borders as the state’s Covid infections soared. Victoria, which accounts for almost a quarter of GDP, has implemented a curfew from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. for Melbourne’s 5 million people and drastically tightened restrictions on retail, manufacturing and construction. The wider concern is that the spillover to the national economy erodes confidence and prompts firms to put off hiring and investing.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The GDP impact of Victorian restrictions is significant, but we estimate it will dampen, rather than derail, Australia’s economic expansion in 3Q. While an extension of Australia’s recession is a clear risk, the recovery across other regions should see Australia’s GDP expand modestly in 3Q. Successful containment, and the easing of Victorian restrictions through September and October, could see the rebounding of Victorian activity boosting growth in 4Q.”
James McIntyre, economist
The Reserve Bank of Australia releases its quarterly update of economic forecasts Friday. in his policy statement Tuesday, Governor Philip Lowe predicted output would fall 6% over 2020, but then grow by 5% in 2021.
“In this scenario, the unemployment rate rises to around 10% later in 2020 due to further job losses in Victoria and more people elsewhere in Australia looking for jobs,” Lowe said. “Over the following couple of years, the unemployment rate is expected to decline gradually to around 7%.”
Morrison said Treasury’s estimates would be updated in the October budget.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired far fewer workers than expected in July as companies exhausted loans to help with wages and new COVID-19 infections flared up across the country, supporting the view that the nascent economic recovery was faltering.
While other data on Wednesday showed activity in the vast services sector gained momentum in July as new orders raced to a record high, hiring declined. The reports, together with a recent rise in applications for unemployment benefits, suggest job growth pulled back sharply in July. The Labor Department will publish July's employment report on Friday.
""The economy will remain at risk of a renewed downturn so long as a vaccine or therapeutic for the virus remains out of reach,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 167,000 jobs last month after jumping by 4.314 million in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 1.5 million in July.
Hiring weakened across the board last month. Payrolls for medium-sized businesses with 50 to 499 employees fell 25,000. The sharp step-down in hiring was attributed to the expiration of the U.S. government's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the resurgence in coronavirus cases.
The PPP was part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion that gave businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee pay. New cases of the respiratory illness have exploded, especially in the densely-populated South and West regions where authorities in hard-hit areas are closing businesses again and pausing reopenings. 
California, Texas and Florida account for a third of the nation's employment. Labor markets in the Midwest have been strong, but that could change as the region battles a surge in new COVID-19 cases. 
The economy suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product shrinking at its steepest pace in at least 73 years. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its services index increased to a reading of 58.1 last month, the highest since March 2019, from 57.1 in June. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
The ISM said businesses remained concerned about the pandemic, but ""are mostly optimistic about business conditions and the economy."" The ISM, however, noted that sentiment varied across industries, as companies were impacted differently.
Businesses in the healthcare sector said surgical services were only scheduling at 50% capacity. Public administration companies said ""spending is down."" Retailers reported that ""orders and business activity are back to pre-pandemic levels."" Companies in the utilities industries said ""previously stalled projects are starting back up."" 
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry soared to a record 67.7 in July from a reading of 61.6 in June. Its index of services industry employment, however, fell to a reading of 42.1 last month from 43.1 in June, contracting for a fifth straight month. Companies reported either freezing hiring or limiting recruitment.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher on the services industry expansion and Disney's surprise quarterly profit. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LABOR MARKET SLOWING
Though the ADP report, jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, has a poor track record forecasting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report, it added to a plethora of government and private sector reports indicating a significant deceleration in job growth in July.
New applications for unemployment benefits have risen for two consecutive weeks. The ISM's measure of factory employment contracted in July for the 12th straight month. The Census Bureau's weekly Household Pulse Survey signaled a deterioration in labor market conditions in July. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 1.6 million in July, down sharply from the record 4.8 million jobs created in June. That would leave employment about 13.1 million jobs below the pre-pandemic level. 
""The ADP report reinforces our view that the economy has lost momentum in recent weeks following a period of strong growth,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
But there are some glimmers of hope for the economy, which slipped into recession in February. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the trade deficit narrowed 7.5% to $50.7 billion in June. 
Exports rebounded by a record 9.4% to $158.3 billion. Goods exported surged by a historic 14.5% to $102.9, boosted by shipments of motor vehicles and parts, capital goods and industrial supplies, including crude oil. 

That offset a 4.7% increase in imports to $208.9 billion. The rise in exports was the largest since March 2015. Goods imports rose 5.4% to $175.0 billion, lifted by imports of motor vehicles and parts, consumer and capital goods.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 58.1 last month, the highest since March 2019, from 57.1 in June. The index slumped to 41.8 in April, which was the lowest reading since March 2009. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index increasing to a reading of 55 in July.
The report followed the ISM's manufacturing survey on Monday showing factory activity racing to a 16-month high in July. The upbeat ISM surveys are, however, at odds with high frequency data such as weekly applications for unemployment benefits that have suggested the economic recovery that started in May, with the reopening of businesses, was slowing.
Coronavirus cases have sky-rocketed, especially in the densely populated South and West regions where authorities in hard-hit areas are closing businesses again and pausing reopenings. Claims for jobless benefits have risen for two straight weeks. At least 30.2 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks in early July.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry soared to a record 67.7 in July from a reading of 61.6 in June. There was a rise in order backlogs, but exports orders contracted.
The survey's index of services industry employment fell to a reading of 42.1 last month from 43.1 in June. Last month's decline in services industry employment is in tandem with the recent rise in applications of jobless benefits. 
It also bolsters economists' expectations for a pull back in employment growth in July. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 1.6 million jobs last month after a record 4.8 million in June. 

The Labor Department is scheduled to release its closely watched employment report for July on Friday.

Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected the private sector to have added 1.5 million jobs last month.
“The labor market recovery slowed in the month of July,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. “We have seen the slowdown impact businesses across all sizes and sectors.”
June’s figure was revised to show job gains of 4.314 million from the gain of 2.369 million that was initially reported.
The ADP numbers come ahead of the Labor Department's weekly report on initial jobless claims on Thursday and its nonfarm payrolls report for July on Friday.
Last week’s initial jobless claims figures showed a second straight weekly increase in initial applications, together with the biggest increase in continuing claims since May, which could foreshadow a negative nonfarm payrolls number for August.
“Both initial and continuing unemployment claims have picked up in recent weeks, which could show up as a decline in employment during August if the trend persists,” said Diane Swonk, Chief Economist at Grant Thornton.
Friday’s data is expected to show that 1.65 million jobs were added last month, slowing from 4.8 million in June. The report covers the period through mid-July, before containment measures were reintroduced in some states in the second half of the month."

It was the fastest annual growth since June 2017, driven by cheaper mortage rates as the Norwegian central bank cut its key policy rate to a record low zero percent during the coronavirus outbreak.
While Norges Bank has said it aims to keep rates on hold until the second half of 2022, a sustained rally in housing prices could trigger an earlier tightening, Nordea Markets wrote in a note to clients.
Still, the lift in prices in recent months will most likely subside in the time to come as the effects of interest rate cuts wear off, Real Estate Norway said.
Unadjusted prices increased by 0.4% in July from June. The housing data was compiled by Real Estate Norway, FINN and Eiendomsverdi.
Norway's crown currency strengthened slightly against the euro, hitting 10.7036 at 0910 GMT versus 10.7120 earlier.

The rise followed other signs of a gradual recovery in Britain's economy after its historic 25% contraction in March and April. House prices and manufacturing have risen although jobs cuts are mounting in the retail sector.
Dealerships reopened their doors to customers on June 1 in England, June 8 in Northern Ireland, June 22 in Wales and June 29 in Scotland after being closed since mid-March. 
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, an industry body, cautioned that pent-up demand had boosted the 174,887 sales recorded in July. 
""By the end of September we should have a clearer picture of whether or not this is a long-term trend,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said. 
The group has been lobbying for additional support for the sector, including a possible scrappage scheme.

July's increase in sales was the first since December but year-to-date demand is down just over 40% and the latest forecast by SMMT predicts a full-year drop of around 30% in 2020.

89,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Indonesia's economy contracts for the first time since 1999 in the second quarter,"By Fransiska Nangoy and Tabita Diela
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's economy contracted for the first time in over two decades in the second quarter, official data showed on Wednesday, with the government promising faster spending in the coming months to boost growth.
Southeast Asia's largest economy shrank by a bigger than expected 5.32% in the April-June period from a year ago, according to data from Statistics Indonesia, the first contraction since 1999.
That was bigger than the 4.61% contraction forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and down sharply from 2.97% growth year-on-year in the first quarter.
The data showed a broad-based fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and restrictions to contain its spread. Households curbed spending and businesses delayed investments, while exports were hit by lower global demand and commodity prices.
""The risk of recession is getting bigger considering the slower economic performance in the second quarter,"" said Josua Pardede, economist at Bank Permata, adding that government spending had remained slow.
Indonesia has budgeted 695.2 trillion rupiah ($47.88 billion) worth of stimulus for 2020 to protect the economy from the fallout of the outbreak including subsidised loans for small businesses and cash assistance for low-income families.
But the data showed government spending falling 6.9% annually in the second quarter even as the central bank has provided ample monetary stimulus in recent months.
Airlangga Hartarto, Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, told a news conference the government would accelerate spending in the third quarter, without giving details.
""We need to spend a minimum 800 trillion rupiah each quarter"" to get the economy growing again, Hartarto said.
Wisnu Wardana, an analyst at Bank Danamon, also said further economic stimulus should come from the government given that ""monetary policy has been stretched"".
Indonesia's central bank has cut its key interest rates four times this year by a total of 100 basis points to the lowest since at least 2016, when it adopted the rate as its benchmark.
Bank Indonesia and the government also unveiled earlier this month a $40 billion debt monetisation scheme, with the central bank pledging to buy $28 billion of bonds while relinquishing interest payments. 
The economy also shrank 4.19% quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period, on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, after a 2.41% contraction in the first quarter.
Household consumption, which makes up around half of the country's GDP, fell by 5.5% in the second quarter compared to last year, while investment was down 8.61%. Export and imports were down 11.7% and 16.9% respectively over that period. 

Indonesia started easing social restrictions in parts of the country in June, but the number of coronavirus cases accelerated in July, raising concerns about fresh restrictions.

90,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Euro zone retail sales return to pre-pandemic levels,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The volume of retail sales in the euro zone rebounded in June to levels recorded in February before lockdowns, official estimates showed on Wednesday, completing a recovery that began in May after record drops in March and April.
Sales in the 19-country currency bloc rose by 5.7% in June from May, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office. Spending on clothing and car fuel drove the gains.
The increase in sales was smaller than the 5.9% forecast by economists polled by Reuters, but that was largely offset by an upward revision of May sales. 
Eurostat said on Wednesday the volume of shopping leaped by 20.3% in May for the month, revising its earlier estimate of a 17.8% increase, which was already the steepest increase since euro zone records began in 1999.
The two consecutive increases in sales fully offset the record declines in March and April, when many euro zone countries imposed lockdowns to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In a further sign that retail sales were back to pre-crisis levels, Eurostat said the shopping volume in June was 1.3% higher than a year earlier, the first annual rise since February. The increase on the year defied market expectations of a 0.5% drop.
Month-on-month, retail sales went up in June by double digits in Ireland, Spain and Italy, but fell again in Germany and Austria after large increases in May.
Sales of textiles, clothing and footwear grew by 20.4% month-on-month in the euro zone, after a record 224.1% jump in May. Consumers also bought more car fuel, computer equipment and books.
Online shopping fell instead in June for the first time this year by 6.8% on the month, as consumers went back to brick-and-mortar stores.

The quarterly decline was the worst in modern history, topping the 3.8% drop in fourth quarter in 2008, during the financial crisis. But the Swedish economy out-performed much of the rest of Europe's.
Second-quarter GDP in the euro zone fell 12.1% from the previous period and 11.9% across the whole of the European Union. The German economy contracted 10.1%, the Spanish economy by 18.5% and the Italian by 12.4%.
""The economic crunch over the first half of the year is in a different league entirely to the horror shows elsewhere in Europe,"" David Oxley, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
Sweden's response to the COVID-19 outbreak has differed from most other countries in Europe, relying mainly on voluntary measures.
Most schools and many businesses have remained open and, although economic activity has been badly hit, many analysts had forecast that the slump would not be as bad as in many countries that adopted more drastic lockdown measures.
The banking group SEB had forecast a quarterly fall of 8% from the previous period. Nordea had predicted a decline of 8.5%. The central bank foresaw a drop of 8.8%.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",UK businesses grow at fastest pace in five years in July after COVID slump,"LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses in the services and manufacturing sectors grew at the fastest rate in more than five years last month as they began to recover from the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 57.0 from 47.7 in June, its highest since June 2015 and close to the provisional flash reading of 57.1. 
The services PMI also rose, to a five-year high of 56.5 from June's 47.1, again a fraction below the flash reading.
""UK service providers are starting to see light at the end of the tunnel after a record slump in business activity during the second quarter of 2020,"" IHS Markit's economics director, Tim Moore, said.
The PMI numbers reflect the rate of growth, not the level of output, and some economists says Britain could take years to recover the record 25% of output lost over March and April.
Restaurants, cafes and pubs reopened to diners and drinkers on July 4 after more than three months of lockdown, which only began to ease substantially in mid-June when non-essential shops resumed trading.
Retail sales were almost back to their year-ago levels, and house purchases picked up strongly in June. 
But other sectors such as entertainment and arts venues have been much slower to recover, and some Bank of England officials have warned that growth risks levelling off after an initial burst of pent-up demand.
The composite PMI's employment index stayed unchanged from June to July and remained well below 50, suggesting most employers plan to cut staff.
Britain's official unemployment rate has yet to rise, due largely to a government job support programme that ends in October and requires employer contributions from this month.

""The weakness of the employment figures reported in July is clearly a cause for concern and likely to hold back the longer-term recovery in business and consumer spending,"" Moore said.

The Middle East financial and trade hub drew in 12 billion dirhams ($3.3 billion) in the six months to June 30, according to a government of Dubai statement released on Monday.
The statement did not provide a comparative figure, but the government last year reported 46.6 billion dirhams in first half foreign direct investment.
Sami al-Qamzi, head of Dubai's economic department, said the pandemic has presented challenges but that stimulus packages had driven ""positive developments"" in the investment environment.
Dubai's government media office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for further comment.
Dubai was locked down for several weeks as part of government efforts to curb the coronavirus, causing many businesses to temporarily shutter.
The United Arab Emirates has recorded 61,352 cases of the virus and 351 deaths. The Gulf state does not disclose where in the country the infections and deaths have occurred.

More than 18 million people have been diagnosed with the virus globally but amid signs the pandemic was being contained in much of Europe, governments have allowed more businesses to reopen.
The bloc's economy contracted a record 12.1% last quarter, data showed on Friday, while a July Reuters poll predicted 8.1% growth this quarter as businesses begin to return to some sort of normal.[ECILT/EU]
Wednesday's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from IHS Markit, seen as a good indicator of economic health, bounced to 54.9 in July from June's 48.5, ahead of the 54.8 flash estimate. It had been below the 50 level separating growth from contraction for four months.
""Euro zone service sector business activity rebounded in July to grow at a rate not exceeded for over two years,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. 
""France and Germany enjoyed especially strong gains though renewed growth was also recorded in Spain and Italy as COVID-19 containment measures continued to be relaxed.""
Overall demand increased and optimism improved but - likely of concern to policymakers - firms again cut headcount sharply. The employment index held below breakeven at 46.5, albeit better than June's 43.2 reading.
As people ventured out to bars and restaurants, the services PMI rose to 54.7 from 48.3, its highest since September 2018 but short of the 55.1 flash reading.
While purchasing managers were more optimistic about the year ahead, the services business expectations index was below the long-run average at 59.4, although up from June's 56.7.

""Whether the recovery can be sustained will be determined first and foremost by virus case numbers, and the recent signs of a resurgence pose a particular risk to many parts of the service sector, such as travel, tourism and hospitality,"" Williamson said.

Wednesday's IHS Markit services purchasing manager index rose to 55.6, its first time above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction since lockdown measures were introduced in March.
The reading was the highest for Europe's largest economy since June 2019, and well above the previous month's 47.3. In April, the index hit an all-time low of 16.2.
The recovery was less pronounced in financial, rental and business services, which had been less affected by the lockdown, Markit said in its statement on Tuesday.
Some service providers had also resumed hiring, though the overall impact on job creation was marginal, Markit said, particularly because many sectors were only recruiting part-time workers.
Positive developments in the service sector combined with an upward trend in manufacturing to produce a recovery in the composite PMI index, which at 55.3 stood at its highest level since August 2018, driven by strong demand growth. Capacity utilisation was still low, however.

""After a record 10.1% collapse in economic output in the second quarter, GDP growth of 6% is expected in the third quarter,"" said Markit economist Phil Smith. ""But we can't expect a return to pre-crisis levels before 2022.""

PARIS (Reuters) - French service sector activity grew in July compared to June, a survey showed on Wednesday, reflecting the reopening of shops and businesses as curbs in place during one of Europe's strictest COVID-19 lockdowns have been gradually eased.
Data compiler IHS Markit said its purchasing managers index rose to 57.3 points - weaker than the flash forecast of 57.8 - from 50.7 in June. Any reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.
""July PMI data showed the kind of recovery we have been expecting since the easing of lockdown restrictions first began. Both manufacturers and service providers posted sharp expansions in activity following the dire conditions they have experienced in recent months,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
IHS Markit's overall composite PMI index, covering the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 57.3 - again below an initial forecast of 57.6 - from 51.7 in June.
""The latest figures add weight to the argument that economic growth should return in the third quarter, which will represent the first green shoots in the recovery after contractions in both the first and second quarter,"" Kerr said.

Data in July showed that the French economy contracted by a post-war record of 13.8% in the second quarter, although the drop was shallower than expected and a bounceback in consumer spending offered hope of recovery.

The IHS Markit Business Activity Index for services rose to 51.6 from 46.4 in June, climbing above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the first time in five months.
The median forecast in a Reuters survey of 16 analysts had pointed to a reading of 51.1.
Markit said survey respondents frequently put the improvement down to slightly higher demand and the loosening of lockdown restrictions but it said the data indicated a still muted recovery so far.
The improved picture in the services sector follows IHS Markit's sister survey for manufacturing on Monday, which showed factory activity rebounding to its highest level in two years after the lockdown began to ease in May.
The composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services and manufacturing climbed to 52.5 in July from 47.6 in June, showing the quickest expansion in private sector output since July 2018.

The euro zone's third-largest economy contracted 12.4% in the second quarter from the previous three months and 17.3% year-on-year, preliminary data showed on Friday. The fall was less severe than many analysts had predicted.

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of services companies, which account for around half of Spain's economic output, rose to 51.9 from 50.2 in June. The 50 line separates growth from contraction, and the survey hit a record low of 7.1 in April. 
Wednesday's data showed only muted growth and ""most worrying of all, incoming new business failing to regain meaningful traction as the economy opened up,"" said Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit.
""With recent reports of a spike in (coronavirus) cases, plus some countries changing advice for citizens travelling to Spain likely to weigh heavily on the country's key tourism sector, uncertainty over the shape and speed of the recovery from the pandemic has inevitably increased.""
A sister survey of Spanish manufacturing activity on Monday showed a steeper rise to 53.5 in July from 49.0 in June. 
Coronavirus restrictions were gradually lifted from May and scrapped on June 21 as contagion rates and the number of coronavirus fatalities slowed before the recent uptick.

The pace of job losses also slowed, but July still saw the third-fastest reduction in employment on record.
The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 44.9 from 42.5 in June, its second increase in a row but still far below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
Africa's most industrialised economy imposed a hard lockdown in late March to contain the spread of the coronavirus. It has gradually eased curbs on most economic activity since.
The July reading was the 15th in succession below 50, showing the downturn began well before the pandemic.
David Owen, economist at IHS Markit, said: ""Businesses that remained closed or under working-from-home policies continued to report a weak level of sales, with exports also falling steeply.""
This led to a further cut-back to output, and further job losses.
""However, some firms are beginning to operate closer to normal capacity and are seeing an increase in demand. As lockdown restrictions are loosened, we expect more firms to move towards a recovery,"" he said.
South Africa has recorded more than a half a million cases of COVID-19, the most in Africa, with the number of infections continuing to rise rapidly in recent weeks.

Government forecasts are for gross domestic product to shrink by at least 7% this year.

Trade weakness will add to concerns whether the ongoing recovery momentum in the world's second-largest economy can be sustained even as domestic demand continues to improve on the back of government stimulus.
Exports in July are expected to have contracted 0.2% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 28 economists, compared with an increase of 0.5% in June.
Imports likely rose 1.0% on year, the poll showed, easing from a gain of 2.7% the previous month, due to a high base last year and the reimposition of lockdown measures in some overseas economies which hampered the flow of goods, analysts said. 
Both official and private surveys on manufacturing activity showed new export orders for Chinese factories in July still mired in contraction after the pandemic shattered global demand, although overall activity expanded at a faster clip due to improving domestic demand.
China's export performance, boosted by record shipments of medical supplies and robust demand for electronic products, has not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared, but analysts believe weak orders are set to weigh on its manufacturers in the coming quarters.
Specifically, the weakness in July spot prices for dynamic random access memory (DRAM), a type of random access semi-conductor memory, points to weaker export growth in automatic data-processing equipment and components for mainly computers or laptops, Nomura analysts said in a note. 
""This suggests the decent demand for work-from-home electronic products including computers, might have started to lose some steam,"" said Nomura.
Indeed, cargo throughput for foreign trade at major Chinese ports dropped 1.2% on year in the last 10 days of July, reversing from the positive gains recorded in the first 20 days, China Ports & Harbours Association said in a statement on Tuesday. 
Trade frictions with the United States are also set to hurt bilateral trade, the association said, adding the United States resumed collecting an additional tariff of 25% on 55 Chinese goods from July 31.
With heightened risks from U.S. hostility and the coronavirus pandemic, government advisers have told Reuters China is looking to reduce its reliance on overseas markets and technology for its economic development. 
China bought only 5% of the targeted purchases in energy products from the United States in the first half of 2020, falling well short of its U.S. trade deal commitments. It will need to step up buying of commodities if it is to meet an ambitious $36.5 billion target for Chinese imports of U.S. farm goods this year.

Senior U.S. and Chinese officials will review the implementation of their Phase 1 trade deal during an Aug. 15 video conference.

July's consumer price index rose 2.7% from a year earlier , the fastest in six months, driven by increases in transport, utility, alcoholic beverages and tobacco prices, the Philippine Statistics Authority said on Wednesday.
It was near the upper end of the central bank's 2.2% to 3.0% forecast range, and faster than the median 2.5% estimate in a Reuters' poll, which matched June's rate.
Core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, was 3.3%, versus 3.0% in June .
Tame inflation has allowed the central bank to cut interest rates  by a total of 175 basis points this year to a record-low of 2.25% to help support a battered economy.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 49.6, up from 44.6 in June and only a sliver below the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The government suspended international flights on March 19, all but shutting down Egyptian tourism, which it says directly accounts for about 5% of the economy.
Private non-oil activity, which has weakened every month since July 2019, showed its worst ever reading in April, at 29.7, after the pandemic hit in full force in mid-March.
The government restarted flights and reopened major tourist attractions on July 1. Restaurants and cafes have also been allowed to reopen.
""Several companies raised activity as tourist numbers increased and export demand also ticked up,"" IHS Markit said.
""That said... nearly as many companies continued to lower activity due to ongoing structural weakness from COVID-19.""
Output strengthened to 50.9, its highest reading in a year, while new orders came in at 51.4, the highest since November 2017.
The PMI reading for the employment sub-index strengthened only marginally to 46.1 from 44. ""Panellists noted that this was mostly driven by companies not replacing voluntary leavers,"" IHS Markit said.

""The landscape for Egyptian businesses remains both competitive and daunting, but can be improved in the coming months should tourism and other sectors be given a boost,"" said IHS Markit economist David Owen.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, rose to 50.8 in July from 50.4 in June. A number below 50 indicates a contraction. 
""The rate of growth remained marginal and represented only a mild recovery from the downturn experienced by UAE businesses,"" the report said of the improvement in the past two months.
The UAE's oil-producing Abu Dhabi and tourism and trade-reliant Dubai had instituted coronavirus lockdowns earlier this year, and were also impacted by falling oil prices.
Output rose to its highest level since September 2019, with businesses reporting new projects and increased demand as drivers. The index marked a record low of 36.9 in April.
Employment, however, declined for the seventh month in a row, and ""this acted as a drag on overall business conditions,"" said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit.
""Firms were reportedly able to cover the rise in new work with existing workforces,"" the report said, and although the pace of job losses declined, businesses continued to cut costs.
Respondents were therefore less optimistic about future output than last month, as concerns about the coronavirus and weak cash flow weighed on expectations. Some continued to be optimistic about improved demand and increased marketing. 

""It was ... particularly evident that future output sentiment depended on how demand recovered in the coming months, as firms hope that the economy will make strides back to pre-COVID-19 output levels over the second half of 2020."" said Owen.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.0 from 47.7 in June, settling at the mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The latest figure is the highest since February but well below the long-run trend level of 57.1,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""Indicators for output, new orders and jobs all rose in July but fell short of the 50.0 mark, meaning that the PMI would have remained below 50.0 were it not for a solid rise in stocks of purchases and longer suppliers' delivery times.""
The non-oil private sector is at the centre of de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reform plans aimed at diversifying the kingdom's economy away from oil.
The world's biggest oil producer had the region's highest coronavirus figures as of Aug. 3, with over 280,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths.
While many restrictions have been lifted, international flights remain shut and the Haj pilgrimage, a major source of income for the government which in past years would draw some 3 million pilgrims, was scaled back dramatically.
The new export orders sub-index of the survey contracted for the fifth straight month, as international demand remained weak, while employment also fell for the fifth consecutive month.

Sentiment was the strongest since February, with almost a quarter of firms expecting growth over the coming year, the report said.

Investing.com – China’s services sector saw a slowdown from the previous month’s decade-high growth in July, as new export business dropped and unemployment continues to increase, according to an industry survey.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for July was 54.1, remaining above the 50-mark separating contraction and expansion. But it fell from June’s reading of 58.4, the highest reading since April 2010.
Meanwhile, the Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), released on Monday, saw a third consecutive month of expansion and the biggest increase since January 2011 as it rose to 52.8.
Comprising around 60% of the economy and half of the jobs in the country’s cities, the services sector has seen a slower recovery compared to large manufacturers. But although the sector saw a brief uptick as the government lifted COVID-19 lockdown measures, fresh COVID-19 outbreaks in the country and rising unemployment remain challenges to tackle.
“Employment was still a key problem. The combination of expanding demand and production with shrinking employment has dogged the economy for several months,” Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, told Reuters.
The government has introduced measures to help businesses, but Wang said that improving employment would take more time with companies tending to cut labor costs during tough economic times.
Meanwhile, service firms remain optimistic about business prospects overall as PMI readings continue to stay above expansion levels and point to continuing economic recovery from COVID-19."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.1 from June's 58.4, which was the highest reading since April 2010. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The services sector, which accounts for about 60% of the economy and half of the urban jobs, had been slower to recover initially than large manufacturers, but the recovery has gathered pace in recent months as the nationwide COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings gradually lifted.
However, pressures remain. Heavy job losses, pay cuts and now fresh COVID-19 outbreaks in the country's west and northeast regions have made some consumers cautious about spending and going out again.
The Caixin survey showed new export businesses received by Chinese services firms contracted again in July after a brief expansion, weighing on the growth of overall new business, which was predominately driven by domestic markets. 
Firms continued to shed jobs for the sixth straight month, albeit at a slower rate, as they sought to boost profits at a time of rising costs and falling prices.
""Employment was still a key problem. The combination of expanding demand and production with shrinking employment has dogged the economy for several months,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group. 
A slew of measures have been introduced to ensure business survivals, but improving employment takes more time as companies tend to cut labour costs during tough times, Wang said.
Still, the overall expansion in the sector remained elevated in July and in line with the survey's long-term trend. Service firms are growing more optimistic about business prospects as the economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 lockdowns, with a sub-index for confidence in the year ahead improving to the highest since March 2015. 

China returned to growth in the second quarter after a deep slump at the start of the year, but unexpected weakness in domestic consumption underscored the need for more policy support to bolster the recovery.

The final Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to a seasonally adjusted 45.4 in July, hardly an encouraging change from 45.0 in June and a preliminary 45.2 reading.
The survey highlights the continued struggle facing the world's third-largest economy as the pandemic cripples activity and hurts customer demand, though firms' business expectations turned positive for the first time in five months.
""While there were some positive signs in terms of domestic sales, large parts of the service sector remained impacted by fragile customer demand and the cancellation of projects due to the pandemic,"" said Tim Moore, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""As a result, service providers commented on the need to reduce fixed overheads and an aversion to replacing departing staff.""
The headline index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the sixth month, the longest such run since an eight-month stretch through September 2011.
The survey also showed firms shed more jobs and new export business contracted further.
Japan fell into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the first quarter. Preliminary gross domestic product data due later this month is expected to show the country suffered its deepest postwar slump in April-June.
More than a fourth of surveyed businesses saw a drop in activity since June, IHS Markit said, with firms also grappling with lower tourism and cancelled events.

The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, remained in decline as well, rising to a five-month high of 44.9 from June's final 40.8.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased more than expected in June, suggesting the manufacturing sector was regaining its footing, though rising COVID-19 cases threaten the tentative recovery.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday factory orders rose 6.2%, boosted by a surge in demand for motor vehicles, after rebounding 7.7% in May. Despite the second straight monthly gain, orders remained well below their February level.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that orders advanced 5.0% in June. Factory orders decreased 10.1% in the month from a year earlier.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of U.S. economic activity, is recovering as businesses replenish inventories. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that its measure of national factory activity accelerated to its highest level in nearly 1-1/2-years in July. 
Many manufacturers, however, said demand was weak or slow, and that they were laying off workers. A significant improvement in both demand and factory activity is unlikely because of sky-rocketing coronavirus cases, especially in the densely populated South and West regions where authorities in hard-hit areas are closing businesses again and pausing reopenings.
Timely data like weekly applications for unemployment benefits suggests that the economic recovery that started in May, with the reopening of businesses, was ebbing. Claims for jobless benefits have risen for two straight weeks. At least 30.2 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks in early July.
The economy suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product shrinking at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.
Stocks on Wall Street were little changed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher. 
Unfilled orders at factories tumbled 1.4% in June after being unchanged in May. Inventories at factories increased 0.6%, while shipments of manufactured goods surged 9.8%.
Transportation equipment orders rose 20.2% after soaring 78.8% in the prior month. Orders for motor vehicles and parts accelerated 86.2%. Machinery orders increased 3.0%, and orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 1.9%.
The government also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, jumped 3.4% in June instead of increasing 3.3% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, increased 3.3% in June, instead of rising 3.4% as previously reported. Business spending on equipment contracted at its sharpest pace on record in the second quarter, mirroring the historic plunge in GDP.

Business spending on equipment has declined for five consecutive quarters. It was already being undermined by the Trump administration's trade war with China, before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the economy. The coronavirus has also crushed oil prices, leading to deep cuts in shale oil production.

Prices at factory gates in the 19-country currency bloc increased in June by 0.7% month-on-month, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said.
The reading beat forecasts from economists polled by Reuters of a 0.5% rise, and was the first increase after prices had fallen for four consecutive months.
It was driven by a 3.1% rise in energy prices. Otherwise, producer prices would have been flat on the month.
On the year, producer prices fell in June by 3.7%, less than the 3.9% drop expected by economists, and down from the 5.0% decline posted in May.
Producer prices are a key factor shaping consumer inflation, as changes in prices at factory gates largely translate into the final cost for consumers.

Euro zone annual consumer inflation ticked up by 0.4% in July after a 0.3% rise in June.

The largest consumer price rises in July were in the transportation sector, with a rise of 2.44%, while clothing and footwear prices dropped 3.48%. Key food and non-alcoholic drinks prices dropped 1.28%, the TUIK data showed.
Economists had cited coronavirus-related disruptions to production as contributing to the expected dip in year-over-year price rises.

The number of people in Spain registering as jobless fell by 2.33% in July from a month earlier, or by 89,849 people, marking the biggest July drop since 1997, the ministry said.
Still, 3.77 million people remain out of work across the country and overall, there were 761,601 more jobless people in July than in the same month a year ago.
""The rise in hiring, double April's number, indicates a strong recovery in activity,"" Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz tweeted. 
Unemployment fell across all sectors apart from agriculture which saw a 5.9% rise due to the end of fruit-picking seasons.
The number of jobless people had risen in June by 0.13% even as the nationwide lockdown came to an end.

Around 712,000 Spaniards left the country's ERTE furlough scheme, the social security ministry said separately, meaning around two thirds of furloughed workers have now left the program.

Exports, a key driver of Thai growth, slumped 15.2% in the second quarter from a year earlier and 7.1% in the January-June period.
The export picture in the third quarter will be similar to the second period as the global economy has yet to recover, Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong, chairwoman of the Thai National Shippers' Council, told reporters.
While the group keeps its 2020 export target of minus 10% for now, Ghanyapad said there were more negative factors than positive ones and it was therefore possible that shipments could fall by 15%.
That would be the sharpest decline since the commerce ministry started compiling records on exports in 1992 and compares with a 14.3% drop in 2009, during the global financial crisis.
The baht was at 31.05 per dollar at 0710 GMT, a month high. The current level is much stronger than the 33-34 per dollar level needed to help exports, Ghanyapad said.
""We want to shout to the central bank to help take care of it,"" she said. ""The Thai economy is not better than the global economy but why the baht keeps strengthening?"". 

The central bank previously said the strength of baht could hurt the recovery of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy which it predicts will contract by a record 8.1% this year.

Taiwan is one of Asia's major exporters, especially of technology goods, and its export trend is a key gauge of global demand for technology gadgets worldwide. Its largest trading partner is China.
Forecasts ranged widely from a decline of 4.5% to a growth of 3% in the midst of uncertainties over the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted global supply chains and hit the growth outlook for the island's tech manufacturers.
Exports in June dropped 3.8% from a year earlier to $27.13 billion, falling for a fourth straight month.
Taiwan's economy recorded its deepest contraction in nearly 11 years in the second quarter, as the pandemic dampened tourism though global demand for the island's tech exports helped counter the slowdown.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's retailers are facing a consumption drought as the country's second biggest state locks down to fight the coronavirus and as data showed sales volumes suffered their biggest plunge in two decades in the second quarter.
Retail sales adjusted for inflation slipped 3.4% in the June quarter, Tuesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed, the steepest decline since the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2000. Analysts were expecting a 3.2% fall in the quarter.
The larger-than-expected drop suggests consumer spending will be a drag on gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the June quarter. 
The sales downturn was driven by cafes & restaurants, off 29.1%, and clothing, footwear and personal accessory, down 22%. There were also losses in food retailing.
The slump in volumes contrasts with value-based retail numbers, with June seeing a solid 2.7% jump in monthly sales and May recording a stellar 16.9% rise as shops, restaurants and pubs fully re-opened across large parts of Australia.
Economists warned the outlook was clouded by a second wave of coronavirus infections in the state of Victoria, with weekly spending data by the country's major banks already showing signs of moderation.
Victoria declared a ""state of disaster"" this week following a relentless surge in coronavirus infections since late June. 
In contrast to retailers, Australia's exporters have been going gangbusters thanks to demand from China for iron ore and other resources, while imports have been hammered by the lockdowns. 
Separate data on Tuesday showed the trade surplus swelled to A$8.2 billion in June, taking the total for the second quarter to a whopping A$23.4 billion.
Exports rose 3% in June underpinned in part by sharply rising prices for iron ore and gold, providing a windfall to miners' earnings and government tax receipts.

Exports to China alone hit an historic high of A$14.6 billion for the month, bringing the rolling 12-month total to A$151 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated to its highest level in nearly 1-1/2 years in July as orders increased despite a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections, which is raising fears about the sustainability of a budding economic recovery.
Still, the road to recovery for manufacturing likely remains long and bumpy, with the survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday also showing hiring at factories remaining subdued for a year now. About 72% of industries reported growth last month. 
""After the scale of shutdowns we really should be seeing a large proportion of firms saying they are experiencing rising output,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Jobs continue to be lost in the sector. With COVID-19 cases picking up, businesses are likely to remain cautious.""The ISM said its index of national factory activity raced to a reading of 54.2 last month from 52.6 in June. That was the strongest since March 2019 and marked two straight months of expansion. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would rise to 53.6 in July.
The ISM said ""sentiment was generally optimistic"" among manufacturers. The continued improvement in manufacturing despite skyrocketing coronavirus cases, especially in the densely populated South and West regions where authorities in hard-hit areas are closing businesses again and pausing reopenings, is encouraging.
High-frequency data such as weekly applications for unemployment benefits has suggested the economic recovery that started in May with the reopening of businesses was faltering.
Claims for jobless benefits have risen for two straight weeks. A staggering 30.2 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks in early July.
The economy suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product contracting at its sharpest pace in at least 73 years.
But momentum in factory activity could be already slowing. A separate survey from data firm IHS Markit on Monday showed its final manufacturing PMI slipping to 50.9 in July from a preliminary reading of 51.3 more than a week ago. The PMI was still up from a reading of 49.8 in June.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s pursuit of TikTok's U.S. operations and a clutch of upbeat quarterly earnings reports lifted investor sentiment. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
NEW ORDERS ACCELERATE
The ISM said 13 industries including wood products, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances & components reported growth in July. Manufacturers of transportation equipment, machinery and fabricated metal products reported contraction.
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 61.5 in July, the highest since September 2018, from 56.4 in June. The survey's measure of order backlogs at factories rebounded as did orders for exports. 
Despite the surge in new orders, manufacturers' assessment of business was not as upbeat. Transportation equipment makers said ""overall business remains down almost 70%."" 
Furniture makers said they had reduced production and expected additional layoffs. Food manufacturers, whose business has been booming as the pandemic triggered panic buying, worried about uncertainty over schools opening in the fall.
Lack of demand has been highlighted by major manufacturers.  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) last week reported lower second-quarter earnings. The heavy equipment maker, a bellwether for economic activity, said retail sales declines would not worsen in the current quarter, but did not expect them to improve either.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and slashed production on its widebody programs.
Though factory employment continued to improve last month, it remained in contraction territory for 12 straight months. The ISM's manufacturing employment measure rose to a reading of 44.3 from 42.1 in June. This supports economists' expectations for a moderation in employment growth in July.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 1.6 million jobs last month after a record 4.8 million in June. The Labor Department is scheduled to release July's employment report on Friday. 
""At face value, that lends some support to our forecast that while overall non-farm payrolls continued to rebound in July, they did so at a much slower pace than previous months,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior economist at Capital Economics.
Factory employment was already in decline because of the Trump administration's trade war with China.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending dropped 0.7% in June, pulled down by declines in both private and public outlays, after decreasing 1.7% in May. The third straight monthly decline pushed outlays to a one-year low of $1.355 trillion. Economists had forecast construction spending would rebound 1.0% in June.

The median forecast of 20 analysts in the poll was for Southeast Asia's largest economy to post a contraction of 4.61% from a year ago, after growing 2.97% in the first quarter.
It would be the weakest figure since the first quarter of 1999, according to OECD data, and close to the government's forecast for a 4.30% contraction and the central bank's estimate of a 4% to 4.80% contraction.
The large-scale social restrictions put in place across Indonesia to contain the virus outbreak appear to have hit most components of economic activity.

Nomura forecast Indonesia's economy had contracted by 6.1% in the second quarter.
""There are signs that suggest Indonesia's economy is past its weakest point, but with the domestic outbreak not under control yet, economic activity is likely to remain under pressure,"" ANZ economists said in a note, noting government spending picked up only slightly and would not be able to offset other weaknesses.
Indonesia reported its first novel coronavirus infections in early March, though only started bringing in significant restrictions in April.
Since then the number of confirmed cases has topped 113,000 with more than 5,300 deaths, and the caseload accelerated in July. 
Six analysts who shared their full-year growth forecast predicted Indonesia's economy could contract by 0.8% in 2020, compared to 5.02% expansion in 2019.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish manufacturing recovered in July after a coronavirus lockdown was eased, a survey showed on Monday, but Hungary posted a more modest improvement and the Czech Republic did not return to growth, suggesting the region still faces challenges.
Poland started easing its lockdown in May, and economic indicators for June provided some surprises to the upside. Retail sales and industrial output beat analysts' expectations as consumers returned to shops and factories resumed operations.
""The PMI points to a further recovery in the Polish economy related to the gradual lifting of restrictions and the gradual resumption of activity by processing companies,"" said Krystian Jaworski, senior economist at Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) in Warsaw.
In Poland, the IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing rose to 52.8, the first time since October 2018 it has been above the 50.0 line that separates growth from contraction. 
In Hungary the PMI, which is published by The Association of Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory Management, rose to 50.8 in July from a revised 47.4 in June.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel, but the recovery in industry will be slow and gradual,"" said Peter Virovacz, senior economist at ING in Hungary.
Czech manufacturing PMI rose to 47.0 last month from 44.9 in June, returning to pre-pandemic levels with the slowest decline since March 2019. 
""Demand still has significant room for improvement after the collapse caused by the coronavirus,"" said Radomir Jac chief economist of Generali (MI:GASI) Investments CEE in Prague.
The Czech Republic and Hungary have been affected by the difficulties facing the auto industry, which generates 4% to 6% of Hungary's gross domestic product and a tenth of the Czech Republic's.
The Czech Exporters Association said last week the crisis had wiped out about three to four years of export growth. In a survey of companies released last week, the association found none expected revenue growth this year and 43% expected a drop of more than 20%.
Sonia Buchholtz, an economist at employers group Confederation Lewiatan, also struck a note of caution regarding the Polish reading.

""It is hardly surprising that we see improvement compared to the period of increased lockdown,"" she said. ""If we have any form of lockdown it may be difficult for (companies) not to go bust.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing output grew at its fastest pace in nearly three years in July as factories reopened and demand began to pick up after the coronavirus lockdown was eased, a closely watched business survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.3 in July from June's 50.1, broadly in line with an earlier flash estimate of 53.6 and the highest since March 2019.
The PMI's output component - which survey compilers IHS Markit say currently gives a clearer sense of the sector's health - rose to its highest since November 2017 at 59.3.
Orders grew for the first time in five months and optimism rose by the most in two years.
However, the index levels represent the pace of growth rather than the amount of output, and the sector has a long way to get back to where it was before the lockdown.
""Despite the solid start to the recovery, the road left to travel remains long and precarious. An extended period of growth is still needed to fully recoup the ground lost in recent months,"" IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
Official data showed British manufacturing output collapsed by 28% over March and April, before rising 8% in May. 
Car production in the first half of 2020 was the lowest since 1954 and 40% below its level in the same period of 2019, according to industry data released last week.

Britain's future trading relationship with the European Union is also a worry for many businesses that rely on pan-European supply chains, as an 11-month tariff-free transition period ends this year, with no sign yet of a replacement deal.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's manufacturing sector has started to overcome the problems triggered by the coronavirus shutdown, data published on Monday showed, although the road ahead will be tough.
The July Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing rose to 49.2 points in July, according to the data compiled by procure.ch and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), up from 41.9 points in June.
The reading shows the industrial sector close to February's level, before the outbreak hit the country, and near the growth threshold of 50 points.
Positive signals included a fall in the take up of short-time working - where the government pays a portion of furloughed workers' wages - to around 16% of the manufacturing workforce in July, down from 27% in June and 28% in May.
Demand for manufactured products is also increasing, said Credit Suisse economist Claude Maurer.
""More than one-third of businesses surveyed are buying more from Switzerland and the European Union as a result of the coronavirus crisis, while almost half of companies are planning to do so in future,"" Maurer said.
Companies have also adapted their supply chains, buying more products domestically to avoid disruptions.
Still, the recovery in the services sector is starting to slow, the survey showed. Separately, the KOF Employment Indicator said the outlook in the industrial and hospitality sectors remained bleak, adding it expected further job cuts.
The government's scientific advisers have said they think restrictions should be tightened again to flatten a recent spike in COVID-19 cases.
Credit Suisse's Maurer said the recovery from the supply shock, where supply chains had been disrupted, had been relatively quick, while an improvement in demand would take longer.
""This latest data is encouraging, but now is not the time to signal the all-clear,"" he said.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 51.0 in July, rising above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the first time in 19 months.
The June reading was 45.2.
Phil Smith, economist at IHS Markit, linked the rise to a strong pick up in both output and new orders.
He said, however, that the survey pointed to demand remaining below pre-crisis levels, which was holding up a more pronounced recovery.

He added: ""Nevertheless, with new orders up sharply in July the immediate outlook for production looks positive, and the manufacturing sector remains on course to make a strong contribution to an expected technical rebound in the economy in the third quarter.""

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about 10% of the Greek economy, fell to 48.6 in July from 49.4 in June. Readings above 50.0 indicate that activity is growing.
""The manufacturing sector stumbled slightly in its progression towards recovery at the start of the third quarter,"" said IHS Markit economist Sian Jones.
Producers continued to report difficulties stemming from the pandemic, Jones said, noting that tourism - a key source of income for Greece - has been weak and some firms have continued to close.
There was a big drop in new business, with some firms saying the impact on the tourism sector had dented new sales inflows. Weak demand from key export markets saw a drop in new business from abroad.
Reflecting the downturn in client demand, Greek manufacturers were less confident on output over the coming year, with optimism dropping notably from June's four-month high, weighed by uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Firms also expressed less confidence in future output, with companies highlighting greater hesitancy towards client demand over the coming year and how long it will take to return to pre-pandemic output levels,"" Jones said.
On the price front, input costs rose for the first time in four months as raw materials prices climbed. Still, the rate of inflation was marginal overall.

Factory gate prices continued to fall as firms used more discounting in an attempt to boost sales and attract new clients.

Just over 18 million people have been infected by the coronavirus. But governments around Europe have eased some restrictions that had shuttered vast swathes of the bloc's economy.
To offer support to the ravaged economy, the European Central Bank has ramped up its stimulus measures and European Union leaders have agreed on a 750 billion euro recovery fund.
Still, the economy contracted a record 12.1% last quarter, official data showed on Friday, although a July Reuters poll predicted 8.1% growth this quarter.
Factories appear to be playing their part in the recovery. IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index bounced to 51.8 in July from June's 47.4 - its first time above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction since January 2019. An initial ""flash"" release had it at 51.1.
An index measuring output which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday leapt to 55.3 from 48.9, its highest since April 2018.
""Euro zone factories reported a very positive start to the third quarter, with production growing at the fastest rate for over two years, fuelled by an encouraging surge in demand,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. 
""Growth of new orders in fact outpaced production, hinting strongly that August should see further output gains.""
Forward looking indicators in the survey were generally more positive, but policymakers are likely to be concerned that factories again reduced headcount - and at one of the sharpest rates in the survey's 23-year history. The employment index only nudged up to 42.9 from 41.3.

""The job numbers remain a major concern, however, especially as the labour market is likely to be key to determining the economy's recovery path,"" Williamson said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index (PMI) for July rose to 52.4 from 52.3 in June, lifting the index further above the 50 point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said the resurgence in manufacturing activity reflected older, existing orders being carried out rather than new contracts, however.
""French manufacturers saw another improvement in business conditions during July, which was predominantly supported by output growth, much like in June,"" said Kerr.
""However, the resurgence in activity has seemingly been driven by the unfreezing of previously existing orders, according to panellists' comments. This suggests that the recovery in production could be a false dawn, with underlying demand yet to recover,"" he added.

Data published in July showed that the French economy contracted by a post-war record of 13.8% in the second quarter, crushed by a coronavirus lockdown, although the drop was shallower than expected and a bounceback in consumer spending offered glimmers of a recovery.

The median forecast in a Reuters survey of five analysts had pointed to a reading of 51.0.
The index slumped to a record low of 31.1 in April, reflecting the closure of most Italian factories in an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19. Plants were allowed to reopen in May, and the index has now climbed for three months running.
IHS Markit's subindex for output at manufacturers rose to 54.7 in July from a previous 50.8, continuing its revival from a low of 11.6 registered in April to post its strongest reading since March 2018.

The euro zone's third-largest economy contracted 12.4% in the second quarter from the previous three months and 17.3% year-on-year, preliminary data showed on Friday, but the fall was less severe than many analysts had predicted.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of manufacturing companies rose to 53.5 in July from 49.0 in June, having dived to 30.8 in April when all non-essential economic activity in the country was halted by the lockdown.
Coronavirus restrictions were scrapped from June 21 as contagion rates and the number of coronavirus fatalities slowed, but it will take time before factories are running at their full capacity again, the survey showed.
""There remains some way to go until we see a return to levels of activity recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic intensified, with the latest survey again showing falling backlogs of work and cuts to employment,"" Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
The Spanish economy contracted 18.5% in the second quarter, the widest margin on record and one of the deepest downturns in the region, as the pandemic took a heavy toll on the country.

The PMI for manufacturing rose to 52.8 in July from 47.2 in June, above the 50.0 line that separates growth from contraction. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 50.0.
The figure pointed to the strongest month-on-month improvement in the underlying health of the manufacturing sector for two years, but nonetheless manufacturers continued to cut jobs as they adjusted capacity.
""A third successive strong rise in the headline PMI in July... brought to an end a 20-month run of negative readings, the longest downturn in business conditions in nearly 18 years,"" said Trevor Balchin, Economics Director at IHS Markit.

The index's headline reading fell to 48.4 from 49.4 the month before, remaining below the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the 15th month in a row.
""Although output expanded, manufacturing sales fell back into contraction territory amid challenging demand conditions and hesitancy among clients,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. 
Having plunged to a record low of 31.3 in April, the first month of pandemic-related lockdowns in Russia, the headline PMI index has recovered steadily. The output component expanded in July for the second straight month.
But demand remained weak due to uncertainty related to the pandemic, capping inflation in the sector despite an increase in prices for imported goods.
Even though companies have further reduced workforce numbers in an attempt to cut costs, the degree of optimism inched up to a six-month high in July.

""While it is encouraging to see confidence improving among goods producers, our latest forecast is for a 6.4% annual contraction in industrial production in 2020 and a slow recovery in output to pre-pandemic levels,"" Jones said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia's factory pain continued to ease in July with contraction slowing in big export-reliant nations, adding to hopes the region is steadily emerging from the devastating hit of the coronavirus pandemic.
Manufacturing activity in China expanded at the fastest pace in nearly a decade as domestic demand improved, a private sector survey showed on Monday, suggesting the world's second-largest economy will help cushion the pandemic's blow to world growth.
But worries about a second wave of infections may weigh on global demand and business sentiment, keeping any rebound in Asia's factory output feeble, some analysts say.
Japan, for one, will enjoy only a ""very gradual and protracted recovery"" as concerns about a resurgence in COVID-19 cases will weigh on domestic and overseas spending, said Stefan Angrick, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
""With the pace of recovery slowing in some of Japan's key trading partners, exports and business spending are likely to continue to struggle,"" he said.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 52.8 last month from June's 51.2, marking the sector's third consecutive month of growth and the biggest jump since January 2011.
The upbeat findings echoed an official survey on Friday, adding to evidence the world's second-largest economy is getting back on its feet faster than expected.
Japan and South Korea saw factory activity shrink at a much slower pace, a sign that pressures on manufacturers were easing and raising hopes the worst impact from the pandemic was over.
Taiwan's manufacturing activity also rose above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, suggesting that increased demand for work-from-home equipment is underpinning chip sales.
But factory activity in the Philippines and Vietnam slid in July, underscoring the patchy nature of the recovery.
India's factory slump also deepened as renewed lockdown measures to contain surging virus cases weighed on demand and output.
""While the broad steadying of the PMI prints across the region point towards further stabilisation in the regional manufacturing sector after the April-May malaise, the path ahead remains a rocky one, as evidenced by the more uncertain tone in the latest reading for some economies,"" said Wellian Wiranto, an economist at OCBC Bank.
Japan's final au Jibun Bank Flash Manufacturing PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 45.2 in July from 40.1 in June, marking the slowest pace of contraction in five months.
South Korea's IHS Markit PMI rose to 46.9 in July from 43.4 in June, the highest reading since January, reflecting easing pressure on output and new orders.
A gauge of expectations for South Korea's manufacturing output over the next 12 months jumped, though exports - which account for nearly 40% of the economy - remained a concern.
""Manufacturers maintained a bias towards price discounting and continued to take a cautious view on their staffing numbers,"" said IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes.
The hit from lockdowns and social distancing policies to contain the virus has pushed many Asian economies into recession including Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Singapore.

While some countries have eased restrictions, a renewed spike in infections has cast a shadow over the recovery prospects in Japan.

Reinforcing that grim outlook, the Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index , compiled by IHS Markit, fell to 46.0 last month from 47.2 in June, below the 50-level separating growth from expansion for a fourth straight month and marking its longest spell of contraction since March 2009.
""The survey results showed a re-acceleration of declines in the key indices of output and new orders, undermining the trend towards stabilisation seen over the past two months,"" noted Eliot Kerr, an economist at IHS Markit.
""Anecdotal evidence indicated that firms were struggling to obtain work, with some of their clients remaining in lockdown, suggesting that we won't see a pick-up in activity until infection rates are quelled and restrictions can be further removed.""
A further decline in new orders and output signaled weakness in overall demand despite factories again cutting their prices, leading firms to reduce their workforces for a fourth month in a row.
A persistent decline in both input and output prices raises the chance that overall inflation would ease, after spiking above the upper bound of the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 2-6% in June.
That might give the RBI more room to ease policy further, after having cut its repo rate by 115 basis points (bps) since March to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic.
The central bank was forecast to cut its key interest rate by another 50 bps by year-end, according to a Reuters poll.

With more monetary stimulus expected, business optimism about the coming 12 months hit a five-month high in July, the PMI showed.

The figures come on the back of the National Bureau of Statistics reporting an official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) of 51.1 on Friday. Both readings stayed firmly above the 50-threshold separating expansion from contraction.

""The supply and demand sides both improved, with relevant indicators maintaining strong momentum,"" Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said in a note accompanying the survey.
But he warned, “we still need to pay attention to the weakness in both employment and overseas demand.”
But the survey also showed that export demand remains weak many manufacturers, both big and small, facing reduced or falling order. The re-imposition of lockdown measures in some countries also continue to dampen overseas demand.
Dampened demand has also led factories to cut payrolls for a seventh consecutive month to reduce costs. But avoiding mass unemployment has been a top governmental priority, with the government pledging continuous support for the economy in the second half of the year on Thursday."

Money sent to Asia, where about a third of migrant workers worldwide come from, could fall by $54.3 billion, or about a fifth of baseline remittances, the Manila-based lender said in the report released on Monday.
Remittances to Asia and the Pacific, which amounted to $315 billion in 2019, help fuel the consumption-led growth for some of the region's developing economies, including the Philippines.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to hit remittances hard in Asia and the Pacific,"" the ADB report said. 
The countries facing ""more severe"" effects are those where the share of remittances to the gross domestic product and per capita remittances are high, such as Tonga, Samoa and other Pacific nations, it said.
Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, which send a large number of seasonal and long-term migrants mainly to Russia and Europe, will also be hard-hit, along with Nepal and the Philippines, the report said.
""The worst-case scenario assumes that the domestic outbreak control and resumption of economic activities take a year's time,"" it said. ""Uncertainty looms about the timing of full recovery, even as lockdowns are lifted.""

It also beat analysts' forecasts for a more modest improvement of 51.3. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The generally upbeat findings echoed an official survey on Friday, adding to evidence that the world's second-largest economy is getting back to its feet faster than expected from the coronavirus shock, which has now been largely brought under control. 
""The supply and demand sides both improved, with relevant indicators maintaining strong momentum,"" Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, wrote in a note accompanying the Caixin survey release.
""We still need to pay attention to the weakness in both employment and overseas demand,"" Wang said.
China announced unprecedented emergency measures early in the year to mitigate the economic damage from the health crisis, which had caused weeks of disruptions as most regions imposed strict lockdowns.
Growth rebounded in the second quarter after a record contraction in the first quarter, but analysts are looking for signs that the recovery is being fuelled by more than just temporary, pent-up demand and state-led stimulus.[ECILT/CN] 
The Caixin survey showed both factory output and total new orders recorded the strongest increase in July since January 2011, and the gauge for output prices rose at the fastest pace in nearly two years, signalling future producer inflation that could help boost firms' profits, the survey showed.
However, export demand remained weak, with the sub-index for new export orders falling for the 7th month, albeit at a slower rate. The Caixin survey is believed to focus more on smaller exporters than the larger official survey.
Many manufacturers are still facing reduced or cancelled overseas orders, and the re-imposition of virus restrictions in parts of the United States and other countries could slow down a global recovery.
The survey also showed Chinese factories cut payrolls for the seventh month to reduce costs, although job shedding moderated as sales improved.
Avoiding mass unemployment has been a top government priority. A top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party on Thursday pledged to ensure continued support for the economy in the second half, explicitly asking for more financing support for manufacturers.

Beijing has rolled out numerous support steps this year, including cuts in key lending rates and banks' reserve requirement ratios, and allowing local governments to sell far more bonds to fund infrastructure projects.

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 46.9 in July from 43.4 in June, marking the highest reading since January. But that was still below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The headline index reflected slower rates of decline in major sub-indexes such as output, new orders and export orders but those still remained low by historical standards.
""July data provides early signs of a turnaround across the South Korean manufacturing sector ... helped by reopening international supply chains and a gradual recovery in demand in key areas such as automotive production,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
A gauge of expectations for manufacturing output over the next 12 months jumped to 49.0, just below the threshold, but still much higher than 45.7 in June.
But exports, which account for nearly 40% of the economy, are still the biggest concern.
South Korea joined Asian peers Japan, Thailand and Singapore in recession, after the economy marked its worst decline since the Asian Financial Crisis in the second quarter.
""Perhaps the strongest signal that demand levels had fallen short of expectations was the largest rise in stocks of finished goods since the start of 2009 ... manufacturers maintained a bias towards price discounting and continued to take a cautious view on their staffing numbers,"" Hayes said.
The sub-index for finished goods inventory, which is often attributed to weaker-than-expected sales, jumped at the fastest pace in 11-1/2 years.
To further reduce costs, firms cut staff for a 15th straight month in July, though at a slower rate.

Monday's survey came after factory production jumped at the fastest rate since 2009 in June and much quicker than expected, adding to hopes that the worst of the coronavirus impact has passed.

Britain's lockdown has been slowly lifting since May, with the last major change on July 4 when hotels, pubs and restaurants were allowed to reopen.
However, on Friday Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was postponing further relaxation, which would have helped some arts and entertainment venues, due to rising cases.
Businesses on average said they were operating at 85% of usual capacity due to social distancing, compared with 72% when a stricter rule generally requiring two metres of distance was in force.
Lack of demand from customers continued to be businesses' most common challenge to resuming normal operations, the CBI said. More than two thirds of firms named it as a barrier to normal operations, down slightly from three quarters in June.
The Bank of England is due to set out new quarterly forecasts on Thursday, as different sectors of the economy recover at different rates from the unprecedented economic damage.
Whether the main barrier to growth is lack of consumer demand, or businesses' difficulties meeting it, will be key to the central bank's decisions on stimulus later this year.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports fell the slowest in four months and beat market expectations, data showed on Saturday, a further sign a recovery in Asia's fourth-largest economy is gaining traction, although threats loom from global flare-ups in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Overseas sales fell 7.0% in July from a year earlier, the trade ministry said, the fifth month of decline but much less than June's 10.9% fall and the 9.7% drop tipped in a Reuters survey.
South Korea is the first major exporting economy to release monthly trade data, providing an early guide to the health of global trade.
Saturday's data come a day after the country's factory output, which trails trade and some other data by a month, jumped at the fastest rate since 2009 and much quicker than expected, supporting hopes that the worst of the coronavirus impact has passed.
""Expectations of an improvement in exports in the second half are materialising,"" though the pace of recovery is likely to be mild, said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at HI Investment & Securities.
The trade-reliant economy has slipped into recession, joining Japan, Thailand and Singapore, in the second quarter despite some 277 trillion won ($232 billion) worth of stimulus rolled out since the outbreak.
Exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, rose 2.5% from a year earlier and for a second month. Those to the United States jumped 7.7%, reversing previous contractions, but sales to the European Union continued to fall, down 11.1%.
Shipments of semiconductors, the nation's top export, climbed 5.6%, while those of computers and ships surged 77.1% and 18.0%, respectively.
Imports dropped 11.9%, sharper than the previous month's 11.2% and the forecast 11.5% fall. That resulted in a $4.27 billion trade surplus, expanded from $3.63 billion in June.
""The global coronavirus spread seems to be the most important variable (in South Korean trade), while renewed tension between the United States and China could add pressure,"" Park added.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending presses ahead; declining income poses challenge,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased for a second straight month in June, setting up consumption for a rebound in the third quarter, though the recovery could be limited by a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and the end of expanded unemployment benefits.
Concerns about sky-rocketing coronavirus infections and the expiring jobless benefits hurt consumer sentiment in July, other data showed on Friday. Robust consumer spending is critical to reviving the economy after it suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter.
""The June data confirm the strong initial phase of the recovery, but we caution that rear-view mirror economics could drive us off a cliff,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Low-income families have nearly regained pre-COVID spending levels supported by strong fiscal aid, but with numerous assistance programs expiring, and a mismanaged health crisis constraining spending on services, the second phase of the recovery will likely be much slower.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 5.6% last month after a record 8.5% jump in May as more businesses reopened, the Commerce Department said. 
Consumers boosted purchases of clothing and footwear. They also spent more on healthcare, dining out and on hotel and motel accommodation, though outlays on services remained lackluster because of caution sparked by the virus. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would advance 5.5% in June. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 5.2% after surging 8.4% in May. 
The data was included in Thursday's advance gross domestic product report for the second quarter, which showed the economy shrinking at a record 32.9% annualized rate, the steepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. Consumer spending tanked at a historic 34.6%. 
With June's increase, consumer spending has pulled out of April's deep hole, but remains 6.9% below its pre-pandemic level. This puts spending on a higher growth trajectory heading into the July-September quarter. 
But the explosion of COVID-19 infections, especially in the densely populated South and West regions where authorities in hard-hit areas are closing businesses again and pausing reopenings, is casting doubt on the magnitude of the expected surge in third-quarter consumer spending.
In addition, tens of millions of unemployed Americans will at midnight on Friday lose $600 in additional weekly jobless benefits after the White House and Congress failed to reach an agreement to extend the supplement, which has allowed them to pay rent and buy food among other expenses.
A separate report from the University of Michigan on Friday showed its consumer sentiment index dropped to a reading of 72.5 this month from 78.1 in June. 
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies. Prices of shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries were slightly higher.

ALL EYES ON CONGRESS
The extra unemployment checks are worth about $75 billion per month and accounted for nearly 5% of personal income in June. A staggering 30.2 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks in the week ending July 11. Though government welfare payments have been declining after jumping 110% in April, unemployment benefits increased 8.5% in June.
""If Congress does not quickly extend these programs, and in light of the recent loss of momentum in the economy, the impact on household wellbeing and economic activity may be severe,"" said Steven Friedman, senior macroeconomist at MacKay Shields in New York. ""Strong federal support for households will likely be necessary until the virus is contained.""
Government transfer payments decreased 8.9% last month, leading to a 1.1% fall in income, on top of May's 4.4% drop. Wages increased 2.2% after rebounding 2.6% in May. With the unemployment rate at 11.1% and COVID-19 slowing the labor market recovery, wage growth could slow further.
A third report on Friday from the Labor Department showed the smallest wage increase in five years in the second quarter. 
Historically high savings could keep consumer spending supported while lawmakers and the Trump administration seek a deal on extending the enhanced jobless benefits. 
Consumers socked away $1.3 trillion over the last three months. Savings funded spending last month, pulling the saving rate down to a still-high 19% from 24.2% in May.
While higher food and energy goods and services prices lifted monthly inflation last month, the trend was muted. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2%, matching May's gain. In the 12 months through June, the so-called core PCE price index rose 0.9% after increasing 1.0% in May. The core PCE index is the preferred inflation measure for the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
""This should allow the Fed to be as expansionary as it wants without inflationary consequences,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

The U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept interest rates near zero and pledged to continue pumping money into the economy.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's gross domestic product shrank 14.1% in the second quarter of 2020, the biggest contraction ever, as lockdowns imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus hit key sectors of the economy.
In a flash estimate, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) said that between April and June this year, the country's GDP plunged 16.5% compared with the same period in 2019, affected by collapsed private consumption, investment and exports.
""It is a number which will be remembered in the history of Portuguese economy, a consequence of strong confinement, particularly between mid-March and the end of April, which affected almost all economic sectors,"" said Filipe Garcia, economist at Informacao de Mercados Financeiros consultants.
Portugal's two largest trading partners, Spain and Germany, also recorded major contractions in GDP in the second quarter of the year, 18.5% and 10.1% respectively.
In yet another sign of weak domestic demand, INE said consumer inflation fell 1.3% in July after growing 0.9% in June.
The country had seen some of its strongest growth streaks in the past few years after leaving behind the 2010-13 economic and debt crisis.
Last year, Portugal's GDP grew 2.2% while unemployment was 6.5%, near record lows. But the economy depends on tourism, which accounts for up to 15% of GDP and has suffered from the coronavirus lockdowns in Portugal and abroad.
The coronavirus is set to leave long-lasting scars on the country's economy, with the Bank of Portugal predicting Portuguese GDP will contract 9.5% in 2020, the biggest recession in a century. The government estimates it will fall 6.9%.
The pandemic is also threatening Portugal's unemployment rate, which rose to 7% in June from a revised 5.9% in May as tens of thousands of jobs were wiped out by the coronavirus.
But the overall number is likely to be substantially higher. Many workers stopped looking for jobs in the lockdown, meaning they were left off unemployment statistics.
The southern Algarve region, usually packed with visitors but now nearly deserted, was badly hit, with the number of registered unemployed in June jumping 231% to more than 26,000 people.
Portugal, which has reported a total 50,868 coronavirus cases and 1,727 deaths, began lifting its lockdown on May 4, but localised outbreaks in and around the capital, Lisbon, have worried authorities at home and abroad.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone's economy recorded its deepest contraction on record in the second quarter, preliminary estimates showed on Friday, while the bloc's inflation unexpectedly ticked up in July. 
In the months from April to June, gross domestic product in the 19-country currency bloc shrank by 12.1% from the previous quarter, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said in its flash estimates.
The deepest GDP fall since the time series started in 1995 coincided with coronavirus lockdowns which many euro zone countries began to ease only from May.
The contraction was slightly more pronounced than market expectations of a 12.0% fall, and followed the 3.6% GDP drop recorded in the first quarter of the year.
Among the countries for which data were available, Spain posted the worst output slump, with its economy shrinking by 18.5% quarter-on-quarter, worse than expected and wiping out all the post-financial crisis recovery of the last six years.
GDP in Italy and France also fell sharply but less than forecast, respectively by 12.4% and 13.8%. Germany, the largest economy in the bloc, saw a 10.1% contraction in the second quarter, worse than expectations of a 9.0% slump.
Inflation continued instead its upward trend, defying expectations of a slowdown, supporting the European Central Bank's expectation that a negative headline reading may be avoided. 
Eurostat said consumer prices in the bloc rose 0.4% on an annual basis in July from 0.3% in June and 0.1% in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.2% increase in July.
Underlying price pressure also accelerated. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, a key measure watched by the ECB, inflation rose by 1.3% from 1.1% in June, Eurostat's flash estimates showed.
An even narrower gauge, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco, jumped to 1.2% from 0.8% in June. 
The acceleration in headline inflation was driven by higher prices of industrial goods which rose by 1.7% after a 0.2% increase in June.
Food, alcohol and tobacco prices went up by 2.0% on the year, but slowed from the 3.2% rise recorded in June.

Energy prices fell by 8.3% in July, after plunging 9.3% in June.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Revived French consumer spending offers hope after economy plunges record 13.8%,"By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - The French economy contracted by a post-war record of 13.8% in the second quarter, crushed by a coronavirus lockdown, although the drop was shallower than expected and a bounceback in consumer spending offered hope of recovery.
The contraction in the euro zone's second-largest economy was steeper than the 10.1% reported by Germany, where authorities kept a surge in COVID-19 related deaths in check and did not have to enforce a lockdown as strict as France's. 
The French lockdown was stringently enforced until May 11, with non-essential shops shut down, and gradually lifted over the course of the second quarter, with cafes and restaurants being allowed to open on June 2.
The contraction was not as severe as the 17% predicted earlier this month by national statistics office INSEE and the 15.3% reduction pencilled in by analysts polled by Reuters. 
""Not too bad!"" tweeted Allianz (DE:ALVG) chief economist Ludovic Subran. ""We were expecting -16% but deconfinement saved the day.""
In another hopeful sign, consumer spending - the traditional engine of the French economy - shot back above its pre-lockdown level in June, INSEE said.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire pounced on the data to encourage consumers to spend money saved during the lockdown to pull the country out of the deepest recession since World War Two.
""The best way to quickly pull out of this situation is to have French people spending,"" Le Maire said, assuring them the government would not raise taxes.
SAVE OR SPEND?
French households could be sitting on a 100 billion-euro pool of savings by the end of the year, the governor of the Bank of France estimated earlier. 
Unlike in the United States, many people in France and Europe have kept their jobs despite the lockdown, thanks to a government scheme that subsidised salaries.
But it remains to be seen whether June's strong consumer data can continue unabated. In July, consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped amid signs of a rebound in COVID-19 infections.
INSEE also revised down to 5.9% from 5.3% the drop in gross domestic product in the first quarter, which included about a fortnight of lockdown, which was imposed on March 17.
That was the third consecutive decline in GDP, in a recession that started in the fourth quarter of last year, when nationwide strikes shaved 0.2% off national output.
INSEE said earlier this year it expected the economy to rebound by 19% in the third quarter and a further 3% in the fourth quarter, with activity 1% to 6% below pre-crisis levels by December. 
Friday's data showed household consumption dropped by 11%, company investment 17.8%, exports by 25.5% and imports by 17.3%.
The drop in the construction sector was particularly steep, INSEE said, with a 24.1% plunge.

Analysts have mentioned the paralysis in the French construction sector as one difference explaining the better performance in Germany, where construction sites stayed open through lockdown.

The economy likely shrank an annualised 2.8% in January-March, the poll of 14 economists showed on Friday, as they bet on a bigger slump than the 2.2% contraction in the government's second preliminary estimate released in June.
The poll comes after the finance ministry this week revised capital expenditure data sharply lower, showing companies had spent much less in the first quarter than originally thought as they were hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
The government will, in a break from usual practice, announce additional revisions to gross domestic product for the January-March quarter on Monday, reflecting those changes.
""Capital spending in the GDP for January-March was likely downgraded reflecting the situation of firms which were seriously affected by the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""This appears to have led GDP for the quarter to be downgraded.""
The economy likely shrank 0.7% on a quarterly basis in the Jan-March period, the Reuters poll showed, compared with a 0.6% fall in the government's second preliminary estimate.
Economists also expected the revisions next week to show capital expenditure grew 1.1% in the first quarter, down sharply from a previous government estimate for 1.9% growth.
While Japan has been hard hit by the coronavirus outbreak, as the nation's state of emergency forced people to stay home and businesses to close, there are tentative signs that a reopening of the economy is helping business activity.
Separate data next Friday is expected to show consumer spending could be past its worst. Economists in the poll expect household spending to have fallen 7.5% in June from a year earlier, less than half the 16.2% drop in May.

Other data on Tuesday meanwhile is expected to show the core consumer price index (CPI) in Tokyo, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, rose 0.2% in July, unchanged from June, according to the poll.

LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices jumped the highest in 11 years this month, adding to signs that parts of the economy are rebounding rapidly as coronavirus restrictions are eased.
Mortgage lender Nationwide said average house prices leapt by 1.7% in July, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists and the biggest monthly increase since August 2009, when the market was recovering from the financial crisis.
""The bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions,"" Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said.
The Bank of England reported that mortgage approvals - a first step to house purchases - quadrupled in June after hitting a record low in May, though they remained more than 40% below pre-pandemic levels.
Prices are now 1.5% higher than they were a year ago, though Nationwide said that on a seasonally adjusted basis, they were 1.6% below a peak reached in April.
The mortgage lender said it expected price gains to continue in the short term, helped by a temporary cut in property purchase tax which finance minister Rishi Sunak announced this month to help what he saw as an ailing market.
But these price increases risked proving a ""false dawn"" if unemployment surged later this year when temporary job support measures end, Nationwide's Gardner warned.
Britain's economy shrank by a quarter over March and April due to the unprecedented hit from the coronavirus lockdown.
Some Bank of England officials fear that while there might be an initial rapid bounceback, this will rapidly slow and it could take years for the economy to regain its former size.

Retail sales are almost back at pre-pandemic levels, for example, but many pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues are closed or operating below capacity due to social distancing restrictions and public concern about the coronavirus.

The quarterly slump in gross domestic product (GDP) in the euro zone's third largest economy was ""unprecedented"", national statistics bureau ISTAT said.
On a year-on-year basis, second quarter GDP tumbled 17.3%, ISTAT said.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a 15.0% contraction quarter-on-quarter and an 18.7% drop year-on-year.
All segments of the economy suffered, ISTAT said, without giving details. 
ISTAT also revised down its readings for the first three months of 2020 to give a quarterly drop of 5.4% and a 5.5% fall against the same period a year ago. These were previously given as 5.3% and 5.4% respectively.
Italy has been one of the countries hardest hit in Europe by Covid-19, registering more than 35,000 deaths since the contagion came to light in late February. Looking to halt the spread, the government introduced rigid restrictions on trade and travel on March 9, forcing most businesses to close.
The lockdown was only gradually eased from May 4 and much of the economy is still hurting.
Italy's official forecast is for a full-year GDP contraction of 8% this year, although Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has said this will probably have to be revised lower. The Bank of Italy has estimated negative growth of 9.5% and the European Commission has predicted the economy will contract 11.2% -- the sharpest fall within the 27-nation bloc.
Spain reported earlier on Friday that its GDP contracted 18.5% in the second quarter from the previous three-month period, while in France, GDP dropped 13.8% and in Germany it fell 10.1%. 

The Italian government has announced measures worth 75 billion euros ($89.18 billion) to help firms and families overcome the crisis and has said it will present an additional 25-billion-euro stimulus package in early August.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain recorded a historic fall in GDP in the second quarter of the year, with the 18.5% drop wiping out all the post-financial crisis recovery of the last six years, data from National Statistics Institute showed on Friday. 
The contraction, triggered by one of Europe's strictest coronavirus lockdowns, was worse than the 16.6% expected by analysts. It came after a 5.2% drop in the first quarter, dragging Spain into its steepest recession ever, at a record pace.
On an annual basis, the economy shrank by 22.1%, versus a 4.1% contraction in the previous quarter.
Private spending was the factor that most dragged the economy down, along with investment and falling exports.
Spain had been growing for 24 quarters in a row until the first quarter, and was beginning to fully recover from the 2008 financial crisis.
The government has forecast a contraction of 9.2% in 2020, surpassing the fall during Spain's 2008-2013 financial crisis, and has said it expects 6.8% growth in 2021.
With tourism hard hit by a UK quarantine and travel advisories, the third quarter, which was expected to mark the start of an economic rebound, will be weaker than expected, said Raymond Torres, chief economist of think tank Funcas.

Spain depends on tourism for 12.3% of its economic output.

Values rose 1.5% from a year earlier to an average of 220,936 pounds ($290,000), the mortgage lender said Friday. That reversed an annual decline in June that was the first since 2012. On a monthly basis, prices rose 1.7%.
“The bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions,’ said Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. “The rebound in activity reflects a number of factors. Pent up demand is coming through, where decisions taken to move before lockdown are progressing.”
The housing market, which was all but shuttered for weeks during the nation’s lockdown, had been starting to show signs of strain, prompting Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s decision to temporarily waive the tax on the first 500,000 pounds of any property purchase.
Nationwide said that could help bring some purchases forward, but cautioned against being overly optimistic, with the prospects of rising unemployment and the increasing unwillingness of lenders to take on risk, potentially acting as headwinds to future growth.
“There is a risk this proves to be something of a false dawn,” Gardner said. “Most forecasters expect labor market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the aftereffects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output snapped four months of decline in June, pointing to a modest recovery in broader business and consumer activity in the world's third-largest economy following a heavy hit to demand from the coronavirus pandemic.
Separate data showed the June jobless rate edged down from a three-year high hit the previous month, although the number of available jobs per applicant fell to a more than five-year low.
Official data released on Friday showed factory output increased 2.7% in June from the previous month when it hit its lowest level since March 2009 during the financial crisis.
The rise was largely thanks to a bounce in motor vehicle production, and beat the median market forecast for a 1.2% increase in a Reuters poll of economists. Japan's economic activity has gradually resumed in recent months after the government lifted a state of emergency at the end of May.
""This comes as a relief,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
But she added that the rebound was extremely small compared to the steep drops in April and May when activity was hit hard by lockdown measures.
""Production activity tends to move in line with corporate earnings. The stock market is quite healthy but there are doubts about whether corporate performance will be able to catch up with market expectations,"" Sera said.
Despite June's rise, output was down 16.7% in the second quarter, the largest drop since comparable data became available in 2015, a Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) official said.
The government raised its assessment of industrial production to say it had stopped falling and was now picking up. Manufacturers surveyed by the trade ministry expected output to jump 11.3% in July and 3.4% in August, the data showed.
Elsewhere in Asia, factory activity gauges for July in China and for June in South Korea came in better than expected, fuelling hopes that the worst impact from the health crisis has passed.
JOB MARKET 'SEVERE'
Japan's seasonally adjusted jobless rate fell to 2.8% in June, separate government data showed, easing from a three-year high of 2.9% hit the previous month. Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a higher jobless rate of 3.1%.
The labour market remained in a ""severe state"" and warranted close monitoring, a government official said, as the decline in the jobless rate was mainly due to a fall in the number of new job-seekers.
The data showed the number of workers in June fell by 770,000 from a year earlier, the official said, while the number of unemployed rose by 330,000 from a year earlier for a fifth straight month of increases.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio dropped to 1.11 in June from 1.20 in May, marking lowest reading since October 2014, labour ministry data showed. It means fewer than six jobs were available per five job-seekers.
Analysts expect Japan's economy to have contracted by more than 20% on an annualised basis in the second quarter as lockdown measures around the world hit business and consumer demand.

158,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 31, 2020 12:24AM ET</span>","China Manufacturing PMI Sees Fifth Straight Month of Expansion, But COVID-19 Challenges Remain","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China reported an expansion in factory activity in July, continuing a five-month streak even amid floods and rising COVID-19 cases globally.
The National Bureau of Statistics reported an official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) of 51.1 earlier in the day. The highest reading since March, it beat June's figure of 50.9 as well as analyst forecasts of 50.7 prepared by Investing.com.
But the bureau also reported a composite PMI of 54.1, slightly lower than June’s 54.2, and a non-manufacturing PMI of 54.2, also slightly lower than June’s 54.4.
PMI readings above 50 indicate expansion.
The figures indicate a recovery from lockdowns imposed earlier in the year to control the COVID-19 outbreak. But recent outbreaks in Xinjiang as well as in the northeastern part of the country are an indication that China’s battle against COVID-19 is far from over.
Ever-increasing COVID-19 cases globally continue to keep factories operating below strength as demand continues to be low. New export orders continued to fall, and unemployment number remained high, with companies letting go of more employees than they hired.
Some investors remained cautiously optimistic, with the number of COVID-19 cases showing no signs of slowing down.
“We see a slowdown in sequential momentum in the third and fourth quarter, though activities should continue to improve further with the base case assumption that Covid-19 remains under control in China,” Wang Tao, chief China economist at UBS AG, said in a report released ahead of the data."
159,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 11:30PM ET</span>","Hong Kong home price growth slows in June, weighed by political uncertainties","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong private home prices edged up 0.1% in June, decelerating from a revised 2.2% gain in the previous month, as one of the world's most expensive markets continued to be pressured by the COVID-19 pandemic and political uncertainties.
Home prices in the financial city have been fluctuating so far this year, posting declines in February and April, and gains in rest of the months. For the first half, prices accumulatively gained 1.8%.
""The current property market is very 'deformed'; home prices still remain high, but rents have already been falling due to a weak economy,"" said Thomas Lam, executive director of property consultancy Knight Frank.
In June, the market recovery was capped by Beijing's plan to impose national security law in the city, sparking a fresh round of escape plans among residents.
Property agents said the fresh wave of COVID-19 outbreak in early July further dampened market sentiment, and the government's social distancing measures hindered flat-visiting activities.
With the economy in recession, Lam expected the impact on home purchasing power would surface in the fourth quarter, pressuring prices. 
The economy contracted 9.0% in April-June from a year earlier, shrinking for the fourth quarter in a row and the second-biggest drop on record, government advance estimates showed earlier this week.
Realtors added, however, with the strong pent-up demand and low interest rate environment, they did not expect to see a big correction in prices. 

Developer Hang Lung Properties (HK:0101) said on Thursday home transaction volume dropped in the first half because of the pandemic, and there could be some more correction going forward.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factories stepped up activity in July for a fifth straight month as improving prospects for electrical and pharmaceutical goods helped sustain a broader recovery from earlier coronavirus shutdowns.
The world's second-largest economy has largely shaken off the strict lockdowns that led to weeks of business paralysis earlier this year, although it is now battling the most aggressive return of the novel coronavirus in months, driven by infections in the country's west and northeast.
The government's manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI), released on Friday, unexpectedly rose to 51.1 in July from June's 50.9. That was the highest reading since March and dashed analyst expectations for a fall to 50.7. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The PMI echoed upbeat readings from other major Asian export nations, with factory production in South Korea jumping at the fastest rate in more than 11 years, and Japan's output snapping four months of decline.
However, analysts caution the recovery could stall amid the resurgence in global infections and as China's factories deal with disruptions from continuing floods. 
""The current rapid pace of recovery is likely to slow in the coming months as the initial boost from re-opening businesses fades,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, of Capital Economics. ""The prop to exports from shipments of goods linked to the pandemic (masks, medical products and work-from-home equipment) is also likely to diminish.""
Reinforcing the downbeat outlook for global demand, industry research released on Friday showed worldwide smartphone sales shrank 14% year-on-year in the second quarter.
The PMI survey showed new export orders fell, indicating continued pressure on external demand, while companies continued to shed more employees than they hired. However, the pace of declines slowed from the previous month, suggesting a bottoming out in these trends while production and total new orders both hit four-month highs. 
Small companies continue to feel both supply and demand pressure, with a sub-index for them falling further into contraction, said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the National Bureau of Statistics, which publishes the PMI.
LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY
In the services sector, activity also expanded for the fifth straight month, driven by strong construction as China ramps up infrastructure projects but also suggesting consumer confidence is recovering.
A Reuters poll this month has forecast GDP to expand 2.2% in 2020, up from 1.8% projected in the last poll in April, with recently improving data underpinning the more upbeat outlook.
Gauges ranging from trade to producer prices all point to a pick-up in manufacturing, but analysts say factories could have a tough time maintaining momentum as pent-up demand wanes and heavy flooding across large swathes of China disrupts activity.
Imports in June rose for the first time since the health crisis hit the economy, as government stimulus stoked demand for commodities, while exports, fuelled by medical goods, also rose in a sign the recovery is gaining traction.
Profits at China’s large industrial firms also rose at the fastest pace in over a year that month on easing costs and improving demand.
The fallout from the global pandemic, however, has left factories operating below strength amid slack demand. June factory gate prices fell in annual terms for the fifth consecutive month.

""We believe it's still too early for Beijing to roll back the easing and stimulus measures introduced in H1, but it may be reluctant to roll out fresh stimulus measures in H2,"" Nomura analysts wrote Friday.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 11:20PM ET</span>",North Korea's economy grew for first time in three years: South Korea,"SEOUL (Reuters) - The economy of isolated North Korea grew for the first time in three years in 2019 as better weather conditions boosted crop yields, but sanctions imposed to stop its nuclear ambitions kept factory output weak, South Korea's central bank said.
Gross domestic product (GDP) in North Korea last year rose 0.4% in real terms from the previous year when the economy suffered the biggest contraction in 21 years, shrinking 4.1% due to a drought and sanctions, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said on Friday.
North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missile and nuclear programmes and the U.N. Security Council has been toughening measures in recent years.
""The sanctions have not become any tougher since 2017-end and weather conditions have been more favourable which helped output from the agriculture sector to improve,"" a BOK official said.
""Even so, its too early to say (North Korea's) economy is in a recovery"" as its trade volume in recent years is half the levels seen before the international sanctions kicked in.North Korea's economy grew 3.9% in 2016, the fastest pace in 17 years, but sharply contracted in the following two years.
Current leader Kim Jong Un vowed to switch the focus from the development of nuclear arsenal to economic development in 2018 before he held an unprecedented summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. The two leaders have met three times, but failed to find a compromise over the North's nuclear weapons programme.
Estimates for North Korean economic data by the BOK are considered the most authoritative as the isolated nation does not disclose any statistics on its economy.
Since 1991, the BOK has used figures from intelligence agencies and the unification ministry data on everything from size of rice paddy crops, water flows at dams to traffic near the border to make estimates.
The BOK said output from agriculture, forestry and fisheries which accounts for about a fifth of North Korea's economy increased 1.4% last year, while industrial production fell 0.9%, following a 12.3% drop in 2018.
However, North Korea's trade volume jumped 14.1% in 2019, as exports of non-sanctioned items such as shoes, hats and wigs increased 43%, the bank said.
The BOK official said North Korea's trade was expected to worsen significantly this year as the coronavirus outbreak would have curbed shipments to China, its biggest trading partner that accounts for more than 90% of North Korea's total trade.
North Korea's gross national income per capita stood at 1.408 million won ($1,184.79) in 2019, about 3.8% of that of South Korea.
In the 1950s North Korea's command-driven economy posted a healthy an annual growth rate of 13.7%. But a focus on post Korean War military spending, the fall of the Soviet Union, and a famine in the mid-1990s that killed an estimated two million people, crippled the economy.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's factory production jumped at the fastest rate in more than 11 years in June and much quicker than expected, data showed on Friday, adding to hopes that the worst of the coronavirus impact has passed.
Industrial production rose by a seasonally adjusted 7.2% month-on-month in June, according to Statistics Korea, sharply reversing a 7.0% decline in May and the fastest growth since February 2009.
That also beat a 2.1% rise, tipped in a Reuters survey of eleven economists, by a large margin.
""(Friday's data) showed more clear signs of improvement in the economy and strengthens the possibility of a economic recovery in the third quarter,"" vice finance minister Kim Yong-beom said.
A breakdown of data showed production of semiconductors, the country's top export, rose 3.8% from May on demands of DRAM chips for servers, while cars and electric devices surged 22.9% and 13.7%, respectively.
From a year earlier, factory output edged down 0.5%, but that was slower than the previous month's 9.8% decline and a 4.9% fall forecast in a Reuters survey.
While more economies have re-opened their economies from coronavirus curbs, weak demand on surging infections across the world will likely weigh on the trade-reliant economy for some time.
""It is premature to say the economic recovery is on track as the protracted spread of virus still remains a risk,"" said Park Sung-woo, an economist with DB Financial Investment.
Factory output data from other countries including China and the United States has firmed in recent months, though the rate of recovery is seen slowing, he added.
The nation's outbound shipments were predicted to contract 9.7% year-on-year in July, extending the decline to a fifth consecutive month. Preliminary data is due on Saturday.

South Korea is the latest Asian country to enter recession, joining Japan, Thailand and Singapore, after its economy marked its worst decline since the Asian Financial Crisis in the second quarter.

164,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",GDP and Jobless Data Reinforce Need for Relief Bill,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The historic economic data reported on Thursday confirmed the enormity of the second-quarter blow suffered by the global economy and the challenging road ahead. It comes when Congress in particular remains divided about how to support relief and reform policies. The longer lawmakers delay, the greater the risk that the stalled economic recovery will lead to a significant spike in unemployment and more business closings that would spread contractionary ripples to the rest of the global economy.
According to the data released on Thursday morning, U.S. gross domestic product contracted by an astounding 32.9% when annualized in the second quarter. This far exceeds both the worst quarter of the 2007-09 recession (an 8.4% fall) and the previous record set in 1958 (a drop of 10%) for this data series. Once again, economists and Wall Street analysts are rushing to recalibrate the Y-axis for the country’s historical growth data. And the U.S. numbers are not the only reason — data coming out of Europe earlier Thursday are also having the same effect.
The initial hope had been that the brutal March collapse in U.S. economic activity would be followed by a sharp recovery in the second and third quarters that would minimize the risk of short-term dislocations becoming deeply embedded problems that would be harder to solve in the long term. This hope for a quick V-shaped recovery has been increasingly called into question in recent weeks by high-frequency indicators that measure economic engagement. It is now being undermined even more strongly by the weekly jobless claims number released Thursday, which showed a deterioration in both initial claims (an increase to 1.43 million) and continuing claims (an increase to 17 million).
All this sends a clear message to Congress — and one that, judging from the extremely dovish tone Federal Reserve officials took on Wednesday, the central bank has fully incorporated: As deteriorating health conditions have forced more states either to halt or reverse their economic reopening plans, the balance of risks to the U.S. economy has shifted in a markedly unfavorable way in the past couple of weeks.
If Congress fails to act, a number of economic forces would risk combining in a negative self-reinforcing loop. For example:
In turn, such a combination would erode the effectiveness of the Fed’s continued exceptional liquidity support for markets, making valuations more vulnerable to sharp and sudden declines. If all this materializes — and it is still an “if” given the ability of policies to counter the mounting risks — the U.S. would face a considerable triple threat to the high, sustainable and inclusive growth needed for longer-term prosperity: that is, a mix of increasing household economic insecurity, lower productivity and more episodes of pronounced financial instability.
The hit to the rest of the world would extend beyond losing an important engine of global growth for a longer period. Protectionist pressures would increase, fueling an already tense set of bilateral trade and investment relations, particularly between China and the U.S. Global policy coordination would become even less likely. The debt service challenges facing developing countries would increase, with some defaulting. And all this would risk increased fragmentation of an already structurally vulnerable economy.
After protracted negotiations, the members of the European Union found a way last week to agree on a potentially transformational fiscal action. In doing so, they strengthened not only their short-term crisis response but also put in a place an important foundation for fiscal harmonization that, unlike the monetary union they achieved, has long eluded them despite being critical to the EU’s joint objective of ever closer integration.
U.S. lawmakers need to react appropriately and urgently to the challenges facing this country, and not only by approving soon a bill that maintains relief efforts and reinforces the potentially self-reinforcing relationship between lower health risks and greater economic activity during this period of “living with Covid.” They also need to materially strengthen over time the other two policy responses I detailed in my previous Bloomberg Opinion article — countering long-term downward pressures on productivity and limiting the rise in household economic insecurity — which are needed to ensure that we end up both winning the war against a depression and securing a peace of longer-term, inclusive socioeconomic prosperity and genuine financial stability.

165,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",U.S. economic growth revised slightly down in 2019,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed a bit more than previously estimated in 2019 as the sugar high from the Trump administration's $1.5 trillion in tax cuts faded over the final year of a record-long expansion that came to an abrupt end in February in the face of the global coronavirus pandemic.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday gross domestic product increased 2.2% last year, revised down from the previously estimated 2.3% and also reflective of consumer spending that had begun to show signs of fatigue heading into 2020. The 2019 growth rate was the slowest expansion since 2016.
Though the updated data showed the massive fiscal stimulus lifted GDP to the White House's 3% target in 2018, growth fell shy of the 3.1% logged in 2015 under President Barack Obama.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly boasted about the economy, writing on Twitter in February, "" BEST  (NYSE:BEST) USA ECONOMY IN HISTORY!"" On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump claimed he could boost annual GDP growth to 4%. Economists have always cautioned the economy did not have the capacity to grow 3% annually on a sustained basis because of low productivity among other factors.
The revision to 2019 growth came as GDP in the second quarter of that year was significantly cut, reflecting downgrades to consumer spending and business investment in equipment. Though growth in the second half was much stronger than previously reported, it was mostly driven by a shrinking import bill.
Growth in consumer spending was marked down through the last six months of 2019, indicating a loss of underlying economic strength even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States' shores and tanked the economy in the first quarter of this year. The economy fell into recession in February.
The updated GDP data showed the economy growing at an average annual rate of 2.5% from 2014 to 2019, up from the previously reported 2.4%. When measured from the fourth quarter of 2014 to the fourth quarter of 2019, GDP increased at an unrevised average of 2.3%. 

The saving rate was cut to 7.5% from 7.9%, with personal income lowered $56.8 billion, or 0.3% in 2019. Corporate profits were raised $175.9 billion, or 8.5%.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's economy will have suffered the worst contraction in its history in the second quarter because of fall-out from a coronavirus quarantine, analysts said in Reuters poll on Thursday.
Meanwhile inflation will continue well below the long-term target rate of 3% amid low consumer consumption.
The Andean country' gross domestic product will have contracted a median of 16% between April and June compared to the same period last year, predictions by 18 analysts showed.
Analyst contraction estimates were between 8% and 18.6%. The government statistics agency will publish second-quarter GDP figures on Aug. 14.
""Clearly it will be the worst registered in history, the worst-hit sectors are those which had the most closures, like retail, recreation, services provided directly to the public,"" said Camilo Perez, head of economic studies at Banco de Bogota.
""But it's clear the impact is generalized. It's not just a brake on supply but on demand, and it's a very complicated collision,"" he added.
Colombia has been in a national lockdown since late March. Though some sectors and regions are gradually reopening, the quarantine is set to last until Aug. 30.
Analysts said the economy will contract 5.95% this year, more than the 5.5% projected by the government. Growth will reach 4.35% next year, those polled said.
Inflation estimates for this year were down drastically to 1.8%, from a 2.21% estimate in last month's survey, because of low domestic consumption.
If inflation falls that precipitously, it would be the lowest price growth figure for 65 years.
""The figures confirm the deflationary effects of some of the measures adopted under the terms of the (government's) economic emergency have been stronger than anticipated,"" said analyst Julio Romero of Corficolombiana.
In July alone, consumer prices will fall 0.17%, taking the 12-month figure to 1.8%, analysts said.

Investing.com - The U.S. economy contracted by an unprecedented annualized rate of 32.9% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday, the worst decline since the Great Depression as the coronavirus pandemic hammered consumer spending.
Economists had forecast a slightly larger decline of 34.1% after a 5% contraction in the first quarter, although they warned that the figure grossly exaggerates the nature of the drop. 
The publication of annualizied GDP data is ""is a process so absurd as to defy any sort of economic logic,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning briefing.
The 9.5% drop in output, in absolute terms, was the sharpest fall in output since the government started to keep records in 1947. 
Though economic activity began to pick up May as restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the virus eased, momentum has waned amid a resurgence in cases, particularly in the South and West, which has led to several states halting or rolling back reopening measures.  
While the curve of new infections has flattened somewhat in the South and West in recent days, Deborah Birx, the White House's Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator, told Fox News on Thursday that the virus is now spreading more deeply into other mid-western states, including Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Missouri and Kansas.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged that the economic outlook would depend on the path of the virus.
""The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,"" the Fed said.
At the same time, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits edged up to 1.434 million in the week ending July 25, from a upwardly revised 1.422 million the prior week, highlighting concerns over the slowdown in the economic recovery.
It was the second consecutive weekly increase.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, rose more sharply than expected to 17.018 million. The previous week's figure was revised down to 16.151 million.
The reports come as millions of unemployed Americans are set to lose a $600 weekly jobless benefit supplement on Saturday, when part of a historic government aid package of nearly $3 trillion expires. 
Talks between the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican-controlled Senate on extending the benefits are currently deadlocked. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said late on Wednesday that they were likely to expire."

The Fed acknowledged that economic activity had picked up somewhat in recent months, though conceded that it remained ""well below"" levels seen at the beginning of the year.

Recent economic data has validated the central bank's concerns as strength in the labor market and consumer confidence appear to be on the wane.
Still, the Federal Reserve's decisive policy action since the Covid-19 pandemic struck in March, has cushioned the blow to the economy, with many on Wall Street suggesting that gross domestic product bottomed in the second quarter of the year.
The Fed’s balance sheet ballooned to $7 trillion in June, up from $4.2 trillion in February, as the central bank rolled out emergency lending programs and stepped its bond purchasing program.
While the Fed has slowed its asset purchases - as it transitions from averting an economic crisis to paving the way for stabilization -  the central bank is in no hurry to further rein in the pace of purchases.
""To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning..."" the Fed added. 
The Fed has been debating how it will adjust monetary policy as the economy recovers.
After the financial crisis, the central bank is widely believed to have tightened rates too soon on bets that inflation would gather steam. Inflation, however, struggled to reach the central bank's 2% target.
This time around, Fed members appear keen to avoid the same policy misstep, and have hinted that future monetary policy tightening should be tied to an economic metric such as inflation rising above 2%.
In a separate statement, the Fed said it would extend its U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines and temporary repo operations through March 31, 2021. "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes rose to a nearly 14-1/2-year high in June, the latest indication that the housing market was weathering the COVID-19 pandemic far better than the broader economy. 
Other data on Wednesday showed a sharp decline in the goods trade deficit last month, with trade boosted by a rebound in exports after three straight monthly decreases as the coronavirus upended global demand. The upbeat reports, however, did not change expectations that the economy contracted at its steepest pace since the Great Depression in the second quarter.
""Trade flows bounced but the underlying trend remains weak, driven by slow global activity and weak demand,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. 
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, rose 16.6% to 116.1 in June. That was the highest level since January 2006.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, increasing 15% in June. Pending home sales advanced 6.3% from a year ago.
The report followed on the heels of news on Tuesday that the homeownership rate raced to its highest level in nearly 12 years in the second quarter. 
Reports this month showed a surge in homebuilder confidence in July, and an acceleration in home construction and sales of both new and previously owned homes in June. 
The housing market is being boosted by historically low mortgage rates, offsetting record unemployment triggered by the coronavirus crisis, which has fallen disproportionately on workers in low-wage industries. 
The public health crisis has seen the emergence of home offices and schooling, fueling demand for bigger homes in small metro areas, rural markets and large metro suburbs. But hurdles remain for the sector, which accounts for less than 5% of gross domestic product. 
New cases of the respiratory illness are surging across the country. Analysts say disrupts to economic activity as authorities try to slow the spread of the virus could unleash a wave of white-collar job losses. There is also a persistent shortage of homes available for sale.
""The spike in COVID-19 infections in states in the South and the West, regions that account for well over 60% of existing home sales, may put some downward pressure on sales in the months ahead,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
Pending home sales increased 11.9% in the populous South in June. They soared 11.7% in the West and surged 54.4% in the Northeast. Contracts rose 12.2% in the Midwest.
AUTO EXPORTS ACCELERATE
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit dropped 6.1% to $70.6 billion last month. Exports of goods accelerated 13.9% to $102.6 billion, eclipsing a 4.8% increase in goods imports to $173.2 billion. Goods imports fell in May to their lowest level since July 2010.
The rebound in exports was led by a 144.1% surge in shipments of motor vehicles and parts. Exports of capital goods soared 11.0% and consumer goods jumped 12.6%. There were also increases in exports of industrial supplies and other goods, but shipments of food, feeds and beverages fell.
Imports of motor vehicles and parts accelerated 107.7% last month. There were also strong gains in imports of capital and consumer goods. Imports of industrial supplies, however, fell. 
Though the smaller goods trade deficit is a boost in the calculation of gross domestic product, it was offset by continued decreases in retail and wholesale inventories. Prior declines in imports forced businesses to draw down inventories.
""Even with the narrowing in the deficit between May and June, it widened on average between the first and second quarter so net exports should drag on growth in the second quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The government is scheduled on Thursday to publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP. According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP probably contracted at a 34.1% annualized rate last quarter, the sharpest drop in output since record-keeping started in 1947. The economy contracted 5% in the January-March quarter. It entered recession in February. 
Retail inventories dropped 2.6% in June after decreasing 6.2% in May. Motor vehicle and parts inventories tumbled 6.5%. 

Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of GDP, fell 0.8% after dropping 1.7% in May. Wholesale inventories fell 2.0% in June after sliding 1.2% in the prior month.

It was the fourth consecutive quarter of contraction for the economy, which was hit hard by anti-government protests last year and more recently by the global health crisis.
The decline in gross domestic product (GDP) eased slightly from a revised 9.1% contraction in January-March, which was the worst quarterly drop since records began in 1974.

Households repaid a net 86 million pounds of debt in June as the lockdown gave them fewer opportunities to spend, and unemployment has yet to affect many due to a government scheme that has paid the wages of more than 9 million employees.

PARIS (Reuters) - French consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped in July amid signs of a rebound in COVID-19 infections, as fears about unemployment remained high and people increasingly felt the need to save money, a monthly survey showed.
The INSEE official statistics agency on Wednesday said its consumer sentiment index fell to 94 from a revised 96 in June, missing an average forecast for 99 in a Reuters poll of economists' expectations.
The data underlines the difficulties the government - which has spent heavily on furlough schemes to keep workers in jobs - faces in persuading consumers to spend their own money to help pull the economy out of its deepest recession since World War Two.
""No V-curve for household confidence in France,"" economist Charles-Henri Colombier tweeted. ""Expectations of a jump in unemployment similar to (the financial crisis) of 2008-2009."" 
Consumer sentiment fell after President Emmanuel Macron put France under one of Europe's strictest coronavirus lockdowns in mid-March, but it had been recovering after a steady easing of restrictions began in mid-May.
The renewed decline in July came as new COVID-19 infections flared, leading France and some other European countries to impose new curbs on public life. France made wearing a face mask in enclosed public spaces mandatory on July 20.
Health Minister Olivier Veran said France was not facing a second wave but that the epidemic continued and citizens must not drop their guard.
Euro zone figures due on Thursday will likely show France is not alone. Flash data on July 23 showed consumer confidence deteriorated across the single currency bloc.
The INSEE survey showed the number of people who considered it the right time to save jumping sharply above the long-term average, the third straight monthly increase. 
The number of households that thought their standard of living had improved over the past 12 months also dropped, for the third consecutive month. Households' concerns about unemployment eased, but remained high after hitting a seven-year peak in June. 
""Today's figures confirm that the scale of the rebound in economic activity in the third quarter will be mainly determined by household consumption,"" ING said in a briefing note.

The government expects the euro zone's second-biggest economy to contract by 11% this year, with as many as 800,000 jobs at risk.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity probably grew for the fifth month in July, but at a slower pace, as floods disrupted manufacturing and a resurgence in coronavirus cases around the world threatens to undermine the gradual domestic recovery.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to ease to 50.7 in July from June's three-month high of 50.9, according to the median forecast of 29 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity. The survey is due to be released on Friday.
Gauges ranging from trade to producer prices have all reflected signs of a further pick-up in manufacturing, but analysts say factories could have a tough time maintaining momentum as pent-up demand wanes and heavy flooding across large swathes of China disrupts economic activity. 
""The water level of areas along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River remain at alarming levels, weighing on production and demand in these regions, including the Yangtze River Delta, which is China's industrial and commercial heartland,"" said analysts from Nomura in a note. 
Rising Sino-U.S. tensions could also pressure China's exports and manufacturing investment in the coming months, they said. 
China has largely managed to recover from strict lockdowns that had led to weeks of economic paralysis, although it is now battling the most aggressive return of the novel coronavirus in months, driven by infections in the far western region of Xinjiang and a separate flare-up in the northeast.
A Reuters poll this month has forecast GDP to expand 2.2% in 2020, up from 1.8% projected in the last poll in April, with recently improving data underpinning the more upbeat outlook.
Imports in June rose for the first time since the health crisis hit the economy, as government stimulus stoked demand for commodities, while exports, fuelled by medical goods, also rose in a sign the recovery is gaining traction. 
Profits at China's large industrial firms also rose at the fastest pace in over a year that month on easing costs and improving demand.

The fallout from the global pandemic, however, has left factories operating below strength amid slack demand. June factory gate prices fell in annual terms for the fifth consecutive month but at a slower-than-expected rate.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely contracted for a fifth straight month in July as global demand remained weak despite the easing of coronavirus-related lockdowns, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
While the worst may be over now that more economies are re-opening, surging infections in the United States and other countries are likely to slow their recoveries and weigh on demand for months to come.
July exports were expected to contract 9.7% from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of 12 economists polled by Reuters. That was slightly milder than a 12.8% plunge in preliminary data for the first 20 days of the month and a 10.9% decline in June. 
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, is considered a bellwether for global trade.
""Exports to China were seen declining again after a brief recovery in June, limiting the extent of overall recovery in exports,"" said Chun Kyu-yeon, economist at Hana Financial Investment.
""The pace of recovery will likely remain subdued, given crippling demand due to a sharp economic downturn in advanced economies and a possibility of a renewed U.S.-China trade dispute,"" she added.
South Korea's export-reliant economy, Asia's fourth-largest, plunged into recession in the second quarter after its sharpest contraction in more than two decades.
Hyundai, which together with sister company Kia Motors is the world's fifth-largest automaker, said last week that weakness in both mature and developing economies means auto sales may only recover to 2019 levels around 2023.
Demand for semiconductors, the country's top export, are also a concern as the world's No. 2 memory chip maker SK Hynix (KS:000660) warned that chip prices would correct in the second half as strong pent-up demand from global lockdowns begins to wane.
July imports were expected to tumble 11.5% year-on-year, compared with a 11.2% plunge in June.
Meanwhile, eleven economists polled by Reuters predicted industrial output in June would rise by a seasonally adjusted 2.1% month-on-month, sharply reversing a 6.7% decline in May. Industrial output data trail trade and some other data by a month.

Ten economists also estimated consumer prices would rise a median 0.4% in July from a year earlier, compared with no change in the previous month.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer prices fell by a record last quarter as the coronavirus crisis caused one-off slides in the cost of child care and petrol, dealing a damaging setback to years of progress toward higher inflation.
The consumer price index (CPI) dived 1.9% in the second quarter, from the first, causing annual prices to drop 0.3% in the first negative reading since 1998. Forecasts were for a fall of 2.0% and 0.4%, respectively.
That was a blow to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which had only just managed to get inflation back up into its 2-3% target band after years of sub-par readings.
Neither is the outlook favourable given the economy is almost certainly in its first recession since the early 1990s.
""Challenging conditions in the labour market will weigh on wages growth, which together with the generally weak economic environment will dampen increases in consumer prices – retailers may have to return to discounting,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
The negative outcome does not mean Australia is in outright deflation, which is a sustained fall in the general level of prices across the economy.
Rather this is an exception caused in part by the government making childcare free from early April to late June, which alone took 1.1 percentage points from CPI. With that relief now ended, childcare costs will rebound sharply this quarter.
Likewise, petrol dived in line with a slide in oil prices to less than zero, and again those have since rebounded. 
Pre-school was also made free in three states, pulling down education costs. Excluding these three factors, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said, CPI would have risen 0.1% in Q2. 
Yet core measures of inflation that strip out the largest price moves were also subdued, with the trimmed mean dipping 0.1% for the first fall in its history. Annual core inflation slowed sharply to 1.2%, from 1.8% in the March quarter.
The RBA is concerned that a run of low readings will drag down expectations of future inflation, lowering wage growth and making it harder to get prices back up.

It has already cut rates to a record low of 0.25% and took the exceptional step of pledging to keep rates down for years to come in the hope of avoiding a drift toward damaging deflation.

The consumer sentiment index rose to 84.2 this month from 81.8 in June, the Bank of Korea said in a statement Wednesday. Despite the improvement, the gauge has yet to reach pre-virus levels that exceeded the 100 threshold which separates optimism from pessimism.
The improvement comes after South Korea’s economy contracted more than expected in the second quarter, falling into the country’s first recession since 2003. The rise in confidence adds to evidence that last quarter was probably the worst for the economy, with improvements in consumption and exports pointing to a rebound in growth.
Still, the gain in sentiment was smaller than in May and June, suggesting the economy’s recovery will be a drawn-out process, affected by virus developments at home and abroad.
South Korean households’ outlook on income contributed the most to the gauge’s increase, followed by spending projections and assessment of the current economy.
The consumer sentiment index was determined by surveying 2,376 households from July 10 to 17. Households’ inflation expectations for the next 12 months rose 0.1 percentage point to 1.7%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell more than expected in July amid a flare-up in COVID-19 infections across the country, which is threatening the economy's recovery from an unprecedented recession caused by the pandemic.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers gloomy about the economy's prospects over the next six months. The ebb in confidence comes as millions of unemployed Americans are set to loose a $600 weekly jobless benefit supplement on Saturday.
""Rising virus cases that are resulting in a pause or rollbacks of reopenings are no doubt weighing on sentiment,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Consumers are also concerned about job and income prospects. Without virus containment that will allow a fuller reopening of the economy, confidence measures will remain under pressure going forward.""
The consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 92.6 this month from 98.3 in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index slipping to 94.5 in July.
The reopening of businesses has boosted economic activity in recent months, but left the country struggling to contain the resurgence in new cases of the coronavirus, forcing some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions to either close businesses again or halt reopenings. 
As a result, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits increased in mid-July for the first time since late March, when the closures of nonessential businesses almost ground the economy to a halt. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
Senate Republicans announced on Monday a $1 trillion coronavirus aid package hammered out with the White House. The proposal, however, sparked immediate opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. Democrats decried it as too limited compared with their $3 trillion proposal that passed the House of Representatives in May. Some Republicans called it too expensive.
Economists have credited the additional $600 in weekly unemployment benefits for the rebound in economic activity. The supplement is part of a historic fiscal package of nearly $3 trillion. With a staggering 31.8 million people collecting unemployment checks in the first week of July, economists have warned against letting this supplement expire.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

HOUSING MARKET RESILIENCE 
The Conference Board survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, rose to a reading of 94.2 this month from 86.7 in June. But the expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions dropped to 91.5 from a reading of 106.1 in June.
That was the biggest drop since March, which was the fifth largest decline on record. 
""While the present situations index increased on the month, if the economy does not regain forward momentum, we are likely to see some retrenchment in the present assessment soon,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, improved to a reading of 1.3 this month from -2.8 in June. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It has dropped from as high as 38.3 in August last year. 
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income was little changed at 15.1% this month and the proportion anticipating a drop increased to 15.0% from 14.1%.
Despite the hand wringing about the economy, the housing market appears to be weathering the COVID-19 storm, thanks to historically low mortgage rates. 
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the homeownership rate jumped a record 2.6 percentage points in the second quarter to 67.9%, the highest since the third quarter of 2008.
The burden of unemployment from the pandemic has fallen disproportionately on low-wage workers, who economists say tend to be renters. The housing market strength could persist, with the Conference Board survey showing the share of consumers planning to buy a home in the next six months surging in July.
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index increased 3.7% from a year ago in May after gaining 3.9% in April. 
""In a remarkable show of resilience, the housing market has stared the pandemic right in the eye and hasn't blinked,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. ""It's likely that the housing market will feel the effects of this downturn at some point, but a shortage of inventory and low rates should continue to place upward pressure on prices.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy lost 1.2 million formal jobs in the first half of the year, official figures showed on Tuesday, but the losses almost evaporated in June, indicating that the labor market is over the worst of the coronavirus crisis. 
The economy lost 10,984 formal jobs in June, economy ministry figures showed, by far the smallest monthly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year. 
While it marked the fourth month in a row of jobs losses, the decline was significantly less than that seen in each of the previous three months when hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost.
Work and Pensions Secretary Bruno Bianco said the figures were a clear sign that the labor market is strengthening, and that a ""V-shaped"" economic rebound is distinctly possible. 
""We can celebrate the improvement of the economy and the labor market. We can't say (for sure) that the recovery will be V-shaped, but these are clear indications that the recovery has started,"" Bianco said in an online presentation.
June's figures followed an upwardly revised 350,000 formal job losses in May and brought the net loss in the first six months of the year to almost 1.2 million.
While June clearly marked an improvement on recent months, the accumulated job losses in the first half of this year are roughly double and treble the same periods in 2015 and 2016, respectively, when Brazil was last in deep recession.
The number of formally registered jobs in Brazil stood at 37.6 million in June, the lowest figure for any June since 2011, the economy ministry said.
So far this year, just over half a million jobs have been lost in the services sector, just under half a million in commerce, and almost a quarter of a million in industry. 

Brazil's official unemployment rate stands at a two-year high of 12.9%, and is expected to rise further in the coming months.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain lost one million jobs between April and June, its biggest ever quarterly decline, as one of Europe's strictest coronavirus lockdowns pulverised the tourism-dependent economy, official data showed on Tuesday.
The National Statistics Institute said unemployment rose from 14.41% the previous quarter to a two-year high of 15.33% - but that masked the extent of the crisis by leaving out people on furlough and those not meeting technical jobless criteria.
The second quarter is traditionally good for labour as Spain's tourism season kicks in. But that was paralysed by the pandemic and a slew of new quarantines do not bode well for summer trade either, even though a lockdown was lifted in June.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast unemployment would reach 16.7%. 
But for the first time in its long history of economic crises, Spain has made mass use of job protection schemes, known as ERTE, to limit redundancies in the face of forced closures.
If not, there would have been far more than the 1,074,000 job losses reported in the second quarter.
""The ERTE have proven to be effective in maintaining employment,"" Secretary of State for the Economy Ana de la Cueva told a news conference. 
WOMEN, YOUNG WORST-HIT 
As well as the furlough factor, many Spaniards did not meet technical criteria for the unemployment category such as actively searching for a new job. 
The destruction of jobs was highest for people on temporary contracts, women and people aged 16-24, de la Cueva said.
The government data showed the intensity of the lockdown, with only 35% of the working population, around 14 million people, actually able to perform their job in the second quarter, mainly essential and home workers. 
Despite the swathe of new unemployment, Spain's jobless rate is still well below its 2013 peak of 26.94% when it was reeling from austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis. 
But since 2018, the fall in unemployment has slowed, pushing back the goal of below double-digit unemployment.

Spain has recorded 278,782 coronavirus cases and 28,434 deaths.

The car industry, spearhead of Germany's export-driven economy, has taken a beating from the pandemic that halted production at some sites during a lockdown that came as companies were already struggling to shift away from diesel- and petrol-powered cars toward ""green"" electric vehicles.
The Ifo institute said its index tracking export expectations in the manufacturing sector rose to 6.9 points in July from -2.2 the previous month thanks to an economic recovery in many countries.
""Cautious optimism is spreading among German exporters,"" Ifo said. ""The automobile sector is one of the biggest winners. After some very tough months, the export business should pick up again.""
 Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) last week flagged signs of recovering demand for top-end Mercedes-Benz models and electric vehicles and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has said it expects slight growth in China's premium car segment this year.
BMW (DE:BMWG) also posted higher second-quarter China sales.
On Monday a monthly survey conducted by Ifo had shown business morale continued to recover in July from its biggest decline in decades, with companies the economy to rebound from the coronavirus shock - as long as a second wave of infections is avoided.
Nonetheless, the German economy is expected to plunge by double digits in the three months from April to June, when public life and economic activity came to a near halt because of the pandemic.

Ifo said on Tuesday that chemical and electronics companies were feeling more upbeat about their prospects of shipping goods abroad while the mechanical engineering sector became less pessimistic even though sales are not expected to rise.

The government has warned of a deeper slowdown and is rolling out a stimulus package worth T$1.05 trillion ($35.9 billion) to cushion the impact from the pandemic, which has hit the island's services sector and tourism.
The trade-reliant economy, a key part of the global technology supply chain, is likely to grow 0.55% in April-June compared with a year earlier, the poll of 16 economists predicted. That would be the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2016 and down from 1.59% in the first quarter. 
Still-strong global demand for electronics, however, helped offset some of the impact as tech products flourished with more people working from home due to social distancing measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
The island's June export orders grew at their fastest pace in nearly two years, boosted by strong demand for telecommuting products such as laptops.
Taiwan has avoided the lockdowns seen in other parts of the world, as early measures prevented a rapid spread of the respiratory disease. It now has only 20 active cases. 
Some analysts have turned more bullish on Taiwan's growth outlook, citing the island's stronger-than-expected technology exports and effective virus-containment measures, which they say will boost domestic demand in the months to come. 
""The hit to both domestic and external demand will likely be less severe than what we had previously expected,"" Fitch Solutions said in a July note, raising its 2020 growth forecast for Taiwan to 0.9% from 0.5% previously.
Economic growth is likely to slow to a five-year low this year of 1.67%, the government said in May, from 2.71% in 2019.

Preliminary second quarter figures will be released on Friday. Revised figures, including details and government forecasts, will be published about three weeks later.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment fell 1.1% between mid-June and mid-July, weekly data showed on Tuesday, with the biggest loss coming from the southeastern state of Victoria, which is grappling with a fresh wave of coronavirus infections.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said total payroll jobs decreased 2.2% in Victoria alone as additional COVID-19 restrictions were re-introduced following an ""alarming"" rise in cases.
The state reported 384 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, on top of a record 532 the previous day.
Tuesday's release is the first official data on the hit from the second wave on Australia's A$2 trillion economy, with economists predicting further job shedding in coming weeks.
The data is ""consistent with our expectations of some setback to the labour market recovery and...we fear a return to a negative employment print this month and possibly August as well,"" said RBC economist Su-lin Ong. ""Our preliminary forecast is -50,000.""
The release, an experimental series, differs from official employment data and is based on wage payment figures from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
Australia had seen a surge in job growth in the past couple of months as authorities largely managed to control the spread of the virus and began re-opening the economy. That helped recoup around 35% of payroll jobs lost due the coronavirus, Tuesday's figures showed.
There had been around 12.3 million people counted as employed in June, according to official employment statistics, down sharply from just over 13 million in early March before the lockdowns kicked in. 
The jobless rate, which had then been steady at 5.2%, has since jumped to 7.4% in June.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has responded by slashing its cash rate to a record low 0.25% in an emergency meeting in March and launching an ""unlimited"" bond buying programme. 
It has pledged to keep interest rates at these levels till progress is made in achieving its employment and inflation goals.

Data on Wednesday is likely to show the largest decline ever in Australian consumer prices in the second quarter, with the consumer price index (CPI) expected to clock its first negative reading since 1998.

The expansion beat the 8% drop forecast by analysts surveyed by Reuters. In May, exports had slumped 25.5%, its worst performance in more than a decade.
""Malaysia's exports performance seems to recover from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic after registering a positive growth in the current month,"" Chief Statistician Malaysia Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in a statement.
Imports in June shrank by 5.6% from a year earlier, slowing from the 30.4% decline recorded in the prior month, data from the ministry showed. Analysts had expected a fall of 10%.

198,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing sector regaining momentum, rising COVID-19 threatens recovery","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased by the most in nearly two years in June and shipments accelerated, but the gains were likely insufficient to avert the deepest plunge in business investment and economic activity since the Great Depression in the second quarter because of the COVID-19 crisis.
The improvement in manufacturing reported by the Commerce Department on Monday was driven by pent-up demand following the reopening of businesses. The budding recovery is threatened by a resurgence in new cases of the coronavirus, which has forced some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions to either close businesses again or halt reopenings. 
""The sugar rush from re-openings has now faded and a resurgence of domestic coronavirus cases, alongside very weak demand, supply chain disruptions, historically low oil prices, and high levels of uncertainty will weigh heavily on business investment,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 3.3% last month, the Commerce Department said. That was the biggest increase in these so-called core capital goods orders since July 2018 and followed a 1.6% rise in May. 
Core capital goods orders remained 3.2% below their pre-pandemic level. Orders last month were boosted by demand for machinery, fabricated metals and primary metals. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components increased 1.2%, likely driven by workers setting up home offices.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders advancing 2.3% in June. Core capital goods orders fell 2.3% on a year-on-year basis in June. 
Shipments of core capital goods surged 3.4% last month, the biggest gain since November 2013. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They rose 1.6% in May and remain 3% below their the February level.
Economists expect business spending on equipment contracted at as much as a 36% annualized rate in the second quarter. The anticipated record drop would lead to the fifth straight quarterly decline in overall business investment. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP collapsed at a 34.1% rate last quarter, which would be the sharpest contraction in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. The economy shrank at a 5.0% pace in the January-March quarter, the deepest since the 2007-09 recession.
The government will publish its snapshot of second-quarter GDP on Thursday. The closure of nonessential businesses in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus almost ground the economy to a halt, with most of the effects felt in April. 
Stocks on Wall Street gained amid hopes of more stimulus and a dovish signal from the Federal Reserve to revive a battered domestic economy. Fed officials are scheduled to gather for a regular two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SLOWER, BUMPIER RECOVERY 
""While we doubt the economy is on the verge of a renewed contraction, we do expect the pace of recovery in the second half of the year to be far slower and bumpier,"" said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 7.3% in June after rebounding 15.1% in May. 
Durable goods orders were driven by robust demand for motor vehicles, which accelerated 85.7% after increasing 28.8% in May. That offset a 462.3% plunge in civilian aircraft orders, leading to a 20% rise in orders for transportation equipment. Motor vehicles have a bigger weighting in the transportation category. Orders for transportation equipment surged 78.9% in May. 
Boeing (N:BA) reported only one aircraft order last month after receiving nine in May, according to information posted on its website. The planemaker said this month customers canceled orders for 355 of its 737 MAX jets in the first half of 2020, as the damage done by the jet's grounding and the coronavirus crisis to the airline industry mounted. 
Boeing's best-selling plane has been grounded since March 2019 after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
The increase in both core capital and durable goods orders last month mirrored recent improvements in regional factory activity. But the road to recovery for manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, will be long. 
Unfilled durable goods orders dropped 1.4% in June after being unchanged in May. They edged up 0.1% for core capital goods, matching May's gain. Durable goods inventories ticked up 0.1%, while capital goods stocks fell 0.2%.

""The manufacturing sector remains exposed to weak demand, which will impact investment and hiring decisions going forward,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

Among 13 analysts surveyed by Reuters, the median estimate was for a seasonally adjusted 17.7% drop in gross domestic product (GDP) in the April-June period compared to the first quarter, when the economy contracted by 1.2%.
If the economy shrinks as projected, it would mark the steepest drop in Mexico's GDP since at least early 1993, the oldest period for which data is available from the country's national statistics institute INEGI.
In April and May, much of the country's economic activity was suspended due to measures imposed by the government to confront the pandemic. Mexico has registered 390,516 total infections and 43,680 deaths so far.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected the GDP to contract by 19.6% in the second quarter when compared with the year-ago period.
Over the course of 2020, the analysts expected Mexico's GDP to decline by 10.1% - up from a contraction of 9% predicted by analysts in a Reuters poll earlier this month.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale continued to recover in July from its biggest decline in decades, with companies expecting Europe's largest economy to rebound from the coronavirus shock - as long as a second wave of infections is avoided.
The Ifo institute said on Monday its business climate index rose to 90.5 in July from an upwardly revised 86.3 in June. It was the third increase in a row and a higher reading than expected.
""The German economy is recovering step by step,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said, adding that companies were notably more satisfied with their current business situation.
The government hopes its stimulus package -- more than 130 billion euro ($152.05 billion), including a temporary VAT cut to boost domestic demand -- will help the economy return to a growth path.
The survey showed that consumers were starting to open their wallets while industrial activity was picking up slowly, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
The surprisingly strong Ifo figures suggested that the economy got off to a good start at the beginning of the third quarter. Wohlrabe confirmed a growth forecast of 6.9%.
Still, the economy is expected to plunge by double digits in the three months from April to June, when public life and economic activity came to a near halt because of the pandemic.
The Statistics Office will release preliminary gross domestic product growth data for the second quarter on Thursday.
KfW chief economist Fritzi Koehler-Geib warned it was too early to give the all-clear, despite the encouraging Ifo reading and the trend among other sentiment indicators.
""The pre-crisis level will remain a long way off for the foreseeable future, and the continuing fierce rage of the pandemic in large parts of the world is an enormous risk for Germany as an export nation,"" she said.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Marco Wagner pointed to higher corporate debt, which was curtailing investment, and a tense job market, which was curbing private consumption. ""In addition, a second wave of infection seems to be looming in Europe,"" Wagner warned.
Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Saturday that the government may introduce compulsory coronavirus testing for holidaymakers returning from high-risk destinations after the number of new infections in Germany hit a two-month high.

The number of people registered at government employment agencies as out of work fell by 204,700 in June - the biggest monthly drop on record - to 4,220,900, the ministry said.
France's jobless total had surged to a record 4,575,500 in April as new hiring ground to a halt during the coronavirus lockdown that the government put in place in mid-March. Most restrictions remained in place until May 11.
The ministry said the improvement in June was due mainly to some jobseekers being reclassified as partly active in the labour market because they had found less than full-time work.

Using the broader definition, the number of people seeking work continued to rise in June to a record 6,156,900 even though hiring returned to pre-crisis levels, the data showed.

Profits rose 11.5% in June from a year ago, the fastest increase since late 2018, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. However, the return to growth from May hasn’t made up for the slump earlier in the year due to the coronavirus outbreak, with profits in the first half of the year still down 12.8%.
China’s economy picked up in the second quarter, with gross domestic product returning to growth after contracting in the first three months. Profit growth accelerated in the second quarter on faster production, narrowing factory deflation and lower costs, according to the NBS, but the sustainability of the rebound is “uncertain,” as Covid-19 continues to spread and international trade remains a challenge.
Profits at state owned enterprises fell 28.5% in the Jan.-June period, worse than the 8.4% drop at privately-owned businesses, the NBS said in Beijing Monday.

The statistics bureau said on Monday that profits at China's industrial firms rose 11.5% year-on-year in June to 666.55 billion yuan ($95.27 billion) - marking the quickest profit growth since March 2019.
May marked the sector's first monthly growth in earnings since November, before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
For January-June, industrial firms' profits fell 12.8% year-on-year to 2.51 trillion yuan, but easing from a 19.3% dive in the first five months. 
After a record slump early in the year, China's economy rebounded more than expected in the second quarter as virus lockdown measures ended and policymakers ramped up stimulus. But analysts warn that the rebound is heavily reliant on state-led investment, while domestic and global demand remain weak.[ECILT/CN]
Steel, oil and gas extraction, oil refining and non-ferrous metals saw significant improvements in profit in June with manufacturing costs easing and demand improving, said Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau, in a statement published alongside the data.
But Zhu warned about the outlook as market demand remains weak amid the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the international trade situation is ""complex and severe,"" so uncertainties remain over the sustainability of profit growth. 
Major manufacturers of raw pharmaceutical ingredient and medical equipment, including Zhejiang Nhu (SZ:002001) and Zhejiang Yueyue (SZ:002223), said they expect stronger profit for the first six months on better sales.
Gauges ranging from factory surveys to producer prices have all reflected signs of a further pickup in manufacturing, but analysts say factories could have a tough time maintaining momentum as pent-up demand wanes, exports struggle and heavy flooding disrupts construction and other economic activity in the Yangtze Delta. 
Rising inventories and sluggish demand could also weigh on profit margins.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 28.5% on year for the first six months, after slumping 39.3% in January-May, the statistics bureau data showed. 
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.4% on an annual basis at end-June, versus 6.6% growth as of end-May.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's companies spent less than initially estimated in the first quarter of the year, revised data showed on Monday, suggesting the coronavirus pandemic's hit to the economy was deeper than first thought.
Capital expenditure rose just 0.1% in January-March from the same period a year earlier, government data showed, much lower than the preliminary reading of 4.3% growth reported last month.
The weaker data, which is used to calculate revised gross domestic figures (GDP) due next Monday, signalled the world's third-largest economy shrank at a faster pace than initially estimated in the first quarter, said analysts.
""There's no mistake that there will be a downward revision (of GDP),"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Demand conditions are likely to remain depressed for a longer time. Overall capital spending will likely remain weak as there are moves to stop investments to achieve labour savings,"" he said.
The government reported the second preliminary GDP data last month based on a MOF survey which had to be revised as the ministry could not collect sufficient data for the preliminary capex figures due to coronavirus disruptions.
The government will announce further revisions to the first-quarter GDP figures on Aug. 3 reflecting the revised capital spending data. Japan's economy shrank a revised 2.2% in the first quarter and remains on course for a much deeper slump in April-June.
Manufacturers' spending shrank by 5.3% in January-March from the same period a year earlier, compared with an initial estimate of a 0.6% increase, while non-manufacturing spending rose 2.9%, down from 6.2% seen originally.

“I don’t deny that some of these hot-spot states are going to moderate that recovery, but on the whole the picture is very positive and I still think the V-shaped recovery is in place,” White House economic director Larry Kudlow said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
“And I still think it’s going to be 20% growth rate in the third and fourth quarters,” he added.
Kudlow, who also said he expects a federal moratorium on renter evictions to be extended, aligned with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told Fox News he expects a major rebound after an historic slump in the quarter that ended June 30.
“We always have the second quarter was going to be a very bad quarter. Again, that’s not for economic reasons. That’s for health reasons. We literally shut down the entire economy,” Mnuchin said. “The third quarter, the consensus is 17% GDP [growth], so we do think you’re going to see a very big rebound.”
The comments contrast with warning signs that the pandemic recovery could be faltering as Covid-19 cases surge and the U.S. death toll exceeded 1,000 on four days last week.
Meanwhile, lawmakers are debating of another round of stimulus spending with Republicans in disagreement with Democrats and among themselves over details of what it should cover.
Mnuchin said President Donald Trump’s administration and Senate Republicans are on the same page on the Republican-proposed $1 trillion package. One focus cited by Mnuchin and Kudlow is to limit wage replacement to 70%, which proponents view as an added incentive for people to return to work.
Though massive unemployment appeared to have leveled off, U.S. weekly jobless claims rose for the first time since March in the latest report, the clearest sign yet of a pause in the economic recovery. Consumer sentiment further soured in July. A 1.2% drop in the S&P 500 on Thursday was the index’s biggest decline in almost a month.
Residential real estate has been a bright spot, with home sales hitting an almost 13-year high amid record-low borrowing costs.
Kudlow said the virus surge in the populous states of Florida, Texas and California will lead to “a moderation of this recovery -- no question.” Yet other indicators, such as housing, retail sales and auto sales, paint a brighter picture, he said.
“First of all, I don’t think the economy is going south -- I think it’s going north,” said Kudlow. “There are some key states, yes, California and Texas and Florida that are having hot-spot difficulties right now, but it’s nothing like it was last winter.”
“The states are in charge of” containing the virus, he said. “Each state has a different story. Most of the states are doing rather well in this.”

206,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales shine in June; business activity picks up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes raced to a near 13-year high in June as the housing market outperforms the broader economy amid record low interest rates and migration from urban centers to lower-density areas because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The upbeat report from the Commerce Department on Friday followed on the heels of data this month showing a surge in homebuilder confidence in July, and an acceleration in home construction and sales of previously owned houses in June.
The coronavirus crisis has led companies to allow employees to work from home. The emergence of home offices and schooling has fueled demand for spacious homes in small metro areas, rural markets and large metro suburbs. Housing market strength could help to shore up the retail sector as homeowners buy furniture, garden equipment and other supplies
""Housing has a strong immune system,"" said Michelle Meyer, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York. ""The shock disproportionately impacted the lower-income population who are less likely to be homeowners.""
New home sales rose 13.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 776,000 units last month, the highest level since July 2007. May's sales pace was revised upward to 682,000 units from the previously reported 676,000 units. 
New home sales have now recouped losses suffered when non-essential businesses were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of the respiratory illness. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 14% of housing market sales, rising 4% to a 700,000-unit pace in June. New home sales accelerated 6.9% from a year ago in June. 
But a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections, which has forced some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, could slow the housing market momentum. 
In addition, the labor market recovery appears to have stalled, with the number of Americans claiming unemployment benefits rising last week for the first time in nearly four months. A staggering 31.8 million people were receiving unemployment checks in early July.
Job losses have disproportionately affected low-wage workers, which could explain why the housing market is doing much better than other sectors of the economy, which slipped into recession in February. 
HISTORICALLY LOW MORTGAGES
Sky-rocketing coronavirus cases are casting a shadow over business activity, though output is stabilizing. A separate report on Friday from data firm IHS Markit showed its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 50.0 this month from 47.9 in June. The increase ended five straight monthly declines. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output. IHS Markit said some service providers were struggling with the reintroduction of lockdown measures. The survey's flash composite new orders index slipped to a reading of 49.5 this month from 49.9 in June.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as U.S.-China tensions and fears over mounting COVID-19 cases weighed on investor sentiment, erasing all gains for the benchmark S&P 500 index so far this week. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
Still, the fundamentals for housing, which accounts for just over 3% of economy, remain favorable. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is averaging 3.01%, close to a 49-year low, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). There are more first-time buyers in the market, with the average age 47 years.
""This demographic is less likely to have been impacted by unemployment, will be more financially secure and have a better credit history versus younger members of the population who are more likely to work on lower wages in retail and hospitality,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. 
""Older home buyers are also more likely to be looking for an investment property or a vacation home.""
In June, new home sales soared 89.7% in the Northeast and jumped 18% in the West. They increased 7.2% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, and advanced 10.5% in the Midwest. The median new house price increased 5.6% to $329,2000 in June from a year ago. New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000 to $400,000 price range. 

There were 307,000 new homes on the market in June, down from 311,000 in May. At June's sales pace it would take 4.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.5 months in May. More than 60% of the homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Friday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 50.0 this month from 47.9 in June. The increase ended five straight monthly contractions. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
Coronavirus infections have sky-rocketed, forcing some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. 
IHS Markit said some service providers were struggling with the reintroduction of lockdown measures. The survey's flash composite new orders index slipped to a reading of 49.5 this month from 49.9 in June. 
Its services sector flash PMI increased to 49.6 from a reading of 47.9 in June. Service industry firms reported a faster pace of decline in new orders in July. In contrast, manufacturing firms signaled the strongest expansion in new orders since January.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 51 for the services sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy.

Factory activity rebounded this month, with the flash manufacturing PMI increasing to a six-month high of 51.3 from a reading of 49.8 in June. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11% of the economy, advancing to 51.5 in July. A measure of new orders received by factories climbed to a reading of 51.8 from 50 in June.

The economy contracted a record 22.7% compared with the same month last year, the biggest fall since modern records began in early 1993, according to figures put out by national statistics agency INEGI. In April, the economy shrank by 19.8% on the year.
The deepening contraction came even though Mexico in late May began allowing sectors such as carmaking, mining and construction to reopen after workers were idled in late March to slow the spread of the virus.
Economists forecast Latin America's second-largest economy will suffer its biggest recession since the 1930s.
In a client note, Scotia Bank said the data, coupled with weak investment figures and job creation in recent months, means Mexico may have to revise its growth forecasts downward once again.
A breakdown of the seasonally adjusted monthly data for May showed that primary activities, such as farming, fishing and mining, rose 1.6% from April.
But secondary activities, which include manufacturing, tumbled 1.8% and tertiary activities, which cover the services sector, fell 3.2%.
Mexico's record monthly decline of 17.3% in April from March came as the coronavirus lockdown paralyzed economic activity, leading to a shutdown of factories, shops and tourist resorts.
The government's ""underwhelming"" fiscal countermeasures against the economic crisis suggests the road to recovery may long be fraught, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note to clients.

""The weak fiscal policy response to the pandemic induced sudden stop of activity is likely to lead to a deeper contraction and a shallower recovery,"" the bank said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity grew in July for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit, as more parts of the economy that were locked down to curtail its spread reopened and people emerged from their homes to work and spend money.
Across the world almost 15.5 million people have been infected by the coronavirus but as the rate of infections has eased across much of Europe, governments have loosened some restrictions.
That unleashing of pent-up demand pushed IHS Markit's flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good indicator of the bloc's economic health, to 54.8 in July from June's final reading of 48.5, its highest since mid-2018 and well ahead of the 51.1 forecast in a Reuters poll.
""The sharp rise... is an encouraging sign that the economic recovery continued at a decent pace. But we suspect that activity will remain below pre-crisis levels for at least the next couple of years,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
The headline index had been below the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction since March so a return to positive territory will be welcomed by policymakers and governments who have pumped trillions of euros into the economy.
European Union leaders agreed a 750 billion euro pandemic recovery fund on Tuesday and with European Central Bank monetary policy expected to stay ultra-loose for a long time, optimism about the year ahead improved.
Markets are still expecting a V-shaped recovery - as are some economists - but while Friday's data indicated a bounceback of sorts, it is unlikely to support those views.
""A V-shaped recovery seems quite unrealistic, despite the encouraging numbers,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
French business activity rebounded far more than expected as a post-lockdown recovery in the service sector shifted up a gear, PMI data showed.
Manufacturing activity in Germany stabilised, avoiding a contraction for the first time in 19 months, giving hope for a recovery from a long recession exacerbated by the pandemic.
Meanwhile British businesses, outside the euro zone, experienced the fastest upturn in five years during July as more of the economy reopened and shoppers pushed their spending back up to within a whisker of pre-lockdown levels.
Official data showed Britain's economy shrank more than 25% in March and April, and recovered less than expected in May. A Reuters poll this week suggested the economy would contract more than 9% this year.
JOBS THREAT
As demand increased, euro zone firms cut their headcount at a shallower rate and purchasing managers were at their most optimistic since February, just before Europe began to feel the full brunt of the pandemic. 
The new business index rose to its highest reading since October 2018, suggesting the recovery would extend into August, but there are fears with jobs still being shed and coronavirus containment measures still in place the upswing could be derailed.
Still, a survey of the bloc's dominant service industry, which was hardest hit by the government-imposed lockdowns, climbed above the breakeven mark to its highest since mid-2018.
But some of the resurgence in demand was driven by firms cutting prices for a fifth month, albeit at a shallower rate than in June.

The manufacturing industry also returned to growth with the factory PMI rising to 51.1 from 47.4, its first time above breakeven since January 2019 and ahead of predictions. An index measuring output, which feeds into the Composite PMI, jumped into growth territory.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses have reported their fastest upturn in five years and shoppers pushed their spending back to near pre-lockdown levels, a survey and data published on Friday showed.
An early flash reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) shot up to 57.1 in July from 47.7 in June, above the 50 threshold for growth for the first time since lockdown began in March.
The figure, its highest since June 2015 and above the euro zone's reading for this month, was better than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
The surge suggested Britain's economy would return to growth in the third quarter after shrinking by more than 25% in March and April, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at PMI compiler IHS Markit, said.
""Even with the July rebound, there's a long way to go before the output lost to the pandemic is regained and, while businesses grew more optimistic about the year ahead, a V-shaped recovery is by no means assured.""
Separate official data showed retail sales jumped back almost to pre-coronavirus lockdown levels in June, when non-essential stores in England reopened.
Sales volumes in June leapt by 13.9% from May, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, as spending on clothes and home improvements jumped.
But economists said the shopping bounce was probably at the expense of spending on other things, such as eating out or going to the cinema, which remain hit by worries about the virus.
While the PMI indicated a quickening of growth, it did not signal a return to normal levels of output across businesses, which some economists think could take years. 
A Reuters poll this week suggested the economy could contract by more than 9% this year, its biggest downturn since the 1920s.
The PMI's gauge of employment worsened in July, chiming with other indicators that suggest a wave of job cuts is on the way. Government budget forecasters have warned the jobless rate could rise to its highest since the mid-1980s this year.
On Thursday, Bank of England interest-rate setter Jonathan Haskel said Britain's economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis could be slow and it would depend on whether people felt confident that it was safe to go out.

Consumer sentiment is still below its level before the coronavirus struck, but employers have turned positive about hiring and investment for the first time since February, separate surveys showed earlier on Friday.
The PMI for services, representing most of Britain's economy, rose to 56.6 in July from 47.1. But IHS Markit said demand was weaker than expected for some businesses after the lockdown lifted for bars and restaurants on July 4.
Factories also reported a better July. The factory PMI rose to 53.6 from 50.1 in June, its highest level since March 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales jumped back almost to pre-coronavirus lockdown levels in June when non-essential stores in England reopened, giving a boost to beleaguered clothing stores.
Sales volumes in June leapt by 13.9% from May, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
A 70% surge in clothing and footwear sales reversed much of their slump in recent months, though the sector remains one of the worst hit, with spending 35% below pre-pandemic levels.
Overall sales volumes rose to within 0.6% of February's level. Excluding fuel sales, hit by less commuting and other travel, volumes were 2.4% higher than in February.
Household goods stores also saw strong sales in June especially for furniture and DIY materials. Home improvement retailer  Kingfisher  (L:KGF) this week forecast first-half underlying profit ahead of last year after exceptionally strong demand. 
Retail sales represent only about a third of consumer spending, however, and other figures suggest people remain cautious about returning to places like bars and restaurants.
""The surge in retail sales volumes ... in June is not a sign that households' overall spending also is recovering fully and rapidly,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics. 
Britain's economy shrank by more than a quarter in March and April and only recovered slightly in May when there was a limited relaxation of the lockdown imposed on March 23.
The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, says payments data has suggested a rapid, V-shaped recovery though many of his colleagues are doubtful about a sustained recovery.
The British Retail Consortium said earlier this month that spending among its members - typically large high-street chains - was 3.4% higher this June than last year.
Friday's figures showed that retail sales slumped by a record 9.5% in the second quarter compared to the first.
Compared with June 2019, sales were down 1.6%, a smaller fall than 6.4% seen in the Reuters poll. 
Online spending, which soared at the start of the lockdown, fell as a share of overall spending as shoppers in England were able to return to stores from June 15 onwards. But at 31.8%, it remained much higher than February's 20%.
Consumer sentiment is still well below its level before the coronavirus struck Britain and cafes and restaurants have reported subdued demand since they reopened on July 4.

More than 45,000 people with COVID-19 have died in Britain, Europe's highest death toll. BoE policymaker Jonathan Haskel said on Thursday that persistent health worries as well as a jump in unemployment risked halting the recovery.

IHS Markit's flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up to 50.0 from 45.2 in June, reaching the mark that separates growth from contraction for the first time since December 2018, when activity grew.
The reading beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts who had expected a smaller rise in the index to 48.0.
The flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, jumped to 55.5, its first expansion since February and above forecasts for a rise to 50.3.
""July's PMI registered firmly in growth territory and well above expectations, in a clear sign that business conditions are improving across Germany as activity and demand recover,"" said Phil Smith, Associate Director at IHS Markit.
""Furthermore, for an economy that is steered so much by exports, it was encouraging to see manufacturers reporting a notable upturn in sales abroad.""
Factories saw the first growth in new orders since September 2018, since when manufacturers in Europe's largest economy have faced falling demand after Britain's decision to leave the European Union and trade tensions between the United States and China worsened.
The survey also showed that the services sector, which until the introduction of lockdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus in March had been compensating for the downturn in manufacturing, had expanded for the first time since February.
Expectations and new orders in the sector also rose and employers hired new staff for the first time since February.

The picture was not so rosy in the manufacturing sector, where the pace of layoffs increased slightly in July, the survey showed. But new export orders rose for the first time since August 2018.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary purchasing managers index jumped to 57.6 from 51.7 in June, hitting its highest level since January 2018.
That easily beat economists' average forecast for 53.5 in a Reuters poll and brought the index further away from 50-point level dividing an expansion from a contraction.
French business activity has been recovering faster than expected since the country began emerging from a coronavirus lockdown on May 11.
The government put France under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe in mid-March, shutting down vast swaths of the euro zone's second-biggest economy and plunging the country into its worst recession since modern records began in 1948.
Companies in both the services and manufacturing sectors both ramped up production in July as backlogs built in the face of pent-up demand unsatisfied during the lockdown.
In the dominant service sector, the PMI index jumped to 57.8 from 50.7, beating expectations for a reading of only 52.3 as the flow of new business returned to growth for the first time since February, before the outbreak.
Meanwhile, in manufacturing, the PMI index eased back to 52.0 from 52.3 in June, confounding expectations for a rise to 53.2. While production was the highest since early 2018, new orders fell slightly.

While France's economy has been recovering more quickly than expected, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday that economic data were still too fragile to revise his forecast for an economic contraction of 11% this year.

The companies signed up for $8.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $9.9 billion a year earlier. Borrowings in June, however, rose 33% from the previous month.
Despite the sequential rise in volumes, it remains to be seen whether this trend will continue as the summer progresses, ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 71.5% in June, up from 71.0% in May.
    ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.

215,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rise as labor market takes step back,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week for the first time in nearly four months, suggesting the labor market was stalling amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases and depressed demand.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed nearly 32 million people were collecting unemployment checks in early July. Relentless labor market weakness puts pressure on the U.S. Congress to extend a $600 weekly jobless benefit supplement, which expires on July 31.
""There is no gradual and uneven recovery for the labor market,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
""Washington policymakers looking for signs that additional stimulus is necessary can judge for themselves with the millions and millions of jobless workers getting unemployment benefits. The economy cannot carry on for long if it has to drag almost 32 million unemployed workers with it.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 109,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.416 million for the week ended July 18. That was the first rise in applications since the week ending March 28, when claims raced to a record 6.867 million as nonessential businesses like restaurants and gyms were shuttered to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast applications steady at 1.30 million in the latest week. Claims tend to be volatile in summer when automakers close assembly plants for retooling. Automakers retooled during the mandatory shutdown beginning mid-March.
That likely threw off the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. Unadjusted unemployment insurance claims fell 141,816 to 1.37 million last week.
Including a program funded by the government for gig workers and the self employed among others, who do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance, 2.4 million people filed for jobless benefits last week.
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
NEW LAYOFFS
Cases of the respiratory illness have exploded across the country, prompting some authorities in the hard hit South and West regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. Workers being sent back home again are joining a second wave of layoffs, triggered by lack of demand as the economy battles a recession, which started in February.
Bankruptcies are rising in the retail sector.
""The risk from repeated business closures is that temporary job losses will become permanent,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""This could result in an even slower pace of recovery.""
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of July's employment report. 
Economists expect job growth to pull back this month after surging by a historic 4.8 million in June. Employment last month was boosted by the government's Paycheck Protection Program, which provides businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for wages. Though the PPP was extended to Aug. 8, many small businesses drew their loans in May and June.
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts across the nation, published last week noted ""new layoffs"" across districts. The U.S. central bank added ""many contacts who have been retaining workers with help from the PPP said that going forward, the strength of demand would determine whether they can avoid layoffs."" 
Demand has been showing signs of picking up, with retail sales increasing strongly in May and June, supported by the additional weekly unemployment checks from the government. Unless this supplement is extended, this week is the last time that unemployed Americans are eligible for the benefit.
Some states have capped weekly jobless checks at under $300, while millions do not qualify for the regular unemployment insurance. 
""It is hard to understate the significance of those payments to household income,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Income from unemployment benefits has more than offset the drop in employee compensation since the pandemic struck."" 
Thursday's report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell to 16.197 million in the week ending July 11, from 17.304 million in the prior week. Economists said the drop likely reflected people exhausting eligibility for benefits.
""We would be surprised if this dramatic change was entirely due to a change in labor market conditions,"" Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

A staggering 31.8 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in the first week of July, down 200,615 from the end of June. Economists say this number, which is reported with a two-week lag, offered a more accurate picture of the labor market.

Investing.com – The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose to 1.416 million last week, their first weekly increase since April, as the resurgence in new Covid-19 cases undermined the recovery in the labor market.
The Labor Department reported an increase of 109,000 from a revised figure of 1.307 million for the previous week.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, fell more sharply than expected to 16.197 million. The previous week's figure was also revised downwards to 17.304 million. The decline in continuing claims is, however, linked not just to the number of people finding new jobs, but those dropping out of the workforce by stopping their search for work.

LONDON (Reuters) - British factory orders fell at the slowest pace since March this month and firms are more upbeat after the economic impact of COVID-19 caused the biggest collapse in demand since 1980 over the previous quarter.
The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) monthly order book balance rose to -46 in July from -58 in June. This was its highest reading since March but a weaker number than the average forecast of -38 in a Reuters poll of economists.
A separate quarterly measure of factory orders for the three months to July was its lowest in 40 years, though quarterly output expectations were the strongest since April 2018.
""There are tentative signs of gradual recovery on the horizon, with firms expecting output and orders to begin to pick up in the next three months. But demand still remains deeply depressed,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
Although British manufacturers were allowed to continue working through the lockdown, many shut down temporarily, especially in the automotive sector.
Official data showed manufacturing output collapsed by a record 24.4% in April before rising by 8.4% in May.
The CBI said manufacturers' expectations for domestic orders over the next three months were the highest since January 2018, though they predicted overseas demand would stay below average.
Businesses also plan to cut staff numbers, albeit less widely than in the three months to July.
""This fuels suspicion that (finance minister Rishi Sunak) may feel compelled to take further steps to support the labour market in the autumn budget,"" said Howard Archer, an economist with EY ITEM Club.

About a third of the private-sector workforce has been supported by the government's wage guarantee scheme which is due to end in October.

The consumer sentiment index, published by the GfK institute and based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, rose to -0.3 heading into August from a revised -9.4 in the previous month.
This was the third monthly increase in a row and beat a Reuters forecast for -5.0.
GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said the development in consumer sentiment during the coronavirus pandemic resembled a V-shaped recovery in which a sharp drop was followed by a quick rebound.
""There is no doubt that the reduction in value-added tax has contributed to the extremely positive progress. It is clear that consumers are looking to make major purchases earlier than planned, which will help boost spending this year,"" Buerkl said.
But he cautioned that the positive effect could be temporary as consumers might scale back purchases once the reduced VAT rates expire in January 2021.
The German stimulus package includes a VAT cut for regular goods to 16% from 19% and for food and some other goods to 5% from 7% from July 1 until Dec. 31. The reduction will cost the federal government up to 20 billion euros ($23.17 billion).
Consumers' propensity to buy and their personal income expectations both improved for a third consecutive month, GfK said. They also became more optimistic regarding the development of the economy as a whole.
Buerkl said that consumers were increasingly gaining the impression that the German economy was likely to recover soon, helped by the government's bumper stimulus measures, as long as the infection rate in Germany remains low.

""A second lockdown would quickly shatter any hope of economic recovery,"" Buerkl said.

Asia's fourth-largest economy shrank by a seasonally adjusted 3.3% in the June quarter from three months earlier, the Bank of Korea said on Thursday. That is the sharpest contraction since the first quarter of 1998 and steeper than a 2.3% fall seen in a Reuters poll.
South Korea joins Japan, Thailand and Singapore in technical recession, defined as two straight quarters of decline, as the pandemic slams Asia's trade-reliant economies.
However, analysts and policymakers are looking at the prospect of a recovery that would be faster than those of its regional peers.
""It's possible for us to see China-style rebound in the third quarter as the pandemic slows and activity in overseas production, schools and hospitals resume,"" South Korean finance minister finance minister Hong Nam-ki said after the data was released, referring to China's return to growth in the second-quarter after a deep slump earlier in the year.
South Korea's gross domestic product fell 2.9% in year-on-year terms, the biggest fall since the fourth quarter of 1998 and worse than a 2.0% decline seen in the poll.
Exports, which account for nearly 40% of the economy, were the biggest drag on growth, dropping by 16.6% on-quarter to mark the worst reading since 1963.
South Korea's POSCO (KS:005490), the world's fifth-biggest steelmaker, reported an 84.3% drop in operating profit in the second quarter as global demand for steel plummeted.
On Thursday, the world's No. 2 memory chip maker SK Hynix (KS:000660) warned of uncertainty in the second half, even as its second-quarter operating profit tripled.
""While consumer spending should gradually recover, the threat from the virus is unlikely to fade entirely and some social distancing will probably have to remain in place,"" Capital Economics Asia Economist Alex Holmes said. 
""Meanwhile, global demand is only likely to recover slowly which will weigh on the export recovery.""
South Korea has reported almost 14,000 infections and around 300 deaths since the start of the outbreak, relatively low numbers by global standards although the economic disruptions have been significant.
Construction investment fell 1.3% quarter-on-quarter, while capital investment declined 2.9%.
Output from manufacturing and the service sector fell by 9.0%, and 1.1%, respectively.
One saving grace has been a 1.4% gain in private consumption from three months earlier, thanks to government cash handouts that boosted spending on restaurants, clothes and leisure activities.
The government has rolled out about 277 trillion won ($231 billion) worth of stimulus to fight the economic fallout from the pandemic so far. However, policymakers have little control over the global demand for the country's exports, which includes everything from memory chips to cars to petrochemical products.
""The worst seems to be over. The base effect and fiscal injection from supplementary budget will improve investment,"" said Park Sang-hyun, an analyst at HI Investment & Securities.
For the whole of 2020, analysts see the economy declining by a median 0.4%, which would be the first full-year contraction since 1998. But the International Monetary Fund estimates an even bigger 2.1% contraction.

Last week, the BOK's governor said a downward revision from its previous projection of a 0.2% decline for 2020 was inevitable.

224,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 10:36PM ET</span>","China’s Economy Will Grow 2.5% This Year, UBS Says","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy will grow 2.5% this year according to UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG), which raised its forecast from 1.5% due to the recovery in domestic consumption and strong investment.
The economy will expand 5.5% this quarter from a year earlier, and 6% in the final three months of 2020, the bank said in a new report from Chief China Economist Wang Tao and others. The biggest downside risk to that rebound would be a resurgence of the coronavirus outbreak at home and abroad, they wrote.
U.S.-China tensions, coupled with the prospects for supply chain decoupling and weak company profits, are likely to drag on corporate sentiment and trade, UBS cautioned, but overall, macro-policy will remain supportive in the second half.
The surprising strength of Chinese exports in the second quarter prompted the economists to increase their estimate for trade in the rest of the year, and they also revised up the inflation forecast to 2.5% for 2020 from 2.4% earlier, due to recent floods in the south and a stronger recovery. The property sector is expected to show more resilience, thanks to the economic recovery and effects of easier credit, according to the report.
Oxford Economics also upgraded its full-year GDP forecast to 2.5% from 2% this week on a strong rebound in the second quarter, while flagging risks ahead including policy makers’ worries about frothy equity markets, renewed export restrictions due to virus cases and escalating China U.S. trade tensions. Data from the second quarter may also have overestimated the strength of the rebound, they said.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>","U.S. home sales rack up record gain; tight supply, COVID-19 seen slowing momentum","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased by the most on record in June, boosted by historically low mortgage rates, but the outlook for the housing market is being clouded by low inventory and high unemployment amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday, which also showed house prices rising to an all-time high last month, confirmed a shift toward bigger homes and properties away from urban centers as companies allow employees flexibility to work from home because of the coronavirus. 
The upbeat housing market news was overshadowed by a relentless surge in new COVID-19 infections, which has prompted some authorities in the hard hit South and West regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, threatening the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 slump. 
""While fundamentals will support some activity, the slow recovery in the economy and labor market will limit the growth in home sales,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The leveling off in the recovery as new Covid-19 cases surge lends a further downside risk, particularly since hard-hit regions account for the largest shares of home sales.""
Existing home sales jumped 20.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.72 million units last month. The percentage gain was the largest since 1968 when the NAR started tracking the series. Sales plunged to a 3.91 million unit pace in May, the lowest level since October 2010. 
June's increase ended three straight months of decreases, though home resales remained 18% below their pre-pandemic level. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rebounding 24.5% to a rate of 4.78 million units in June.
Existing home sales, which make up about 85% of U.S. home sales, fell 11.3% on a year-on-year basis in June. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 2.98%, the lowest since 1971, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Data last week showed homebuilding increased in June by the most in nearly four years.
A separate report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase a home increased 2% last week from a week earlier. The economy slipped into recession in February. A staggering 32 million Americans are collecting unemployment checks.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher amid optimism about another round of fiscal stimulus for the economy. The PHLX housing index rose, outperforming the broader stock market. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SPACE FOR HOME OFFICES
Home sales rose surged in all four regions last month. Demand for housing was skewed toward single-family homes, mostly in the suburbs and smaller towns, with people seeking large spaces for home offices and schooling.
Economists believe the migration to suburbs from city centers could become permanent even if a vaccine is developed for the respiratory illness. A homebuilder survey last week showed strong demand for single-family homes in lower density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro suburbs. 
Single-family home sales advanced 19.9% in June. While multi-family home sales shot up 29.4%, they accounted for only 9% of sales, down from the 12% that is considered the norm for the housing market. 
There were 1.57 million previously owned homes on the market in June, down 18.2% from a year ago. The median existing house price increased 3.5% from a year ago to a record $295,300 in June. The NAR attributed the modest percentage gain to sales being concentrated in the more affordable markets in the South.
At June's sales pace, it would take 4.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.3 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 24 days, down from 26 days in May, and 27 days in June 2019. Sixty-two percent of homes sold in June were on the market for less than a month. Tight supply was causing bidding wars in competitive markets.
First-time buyers accounted for 35% of sales in June, up from 34% in May 2020 and matching the share during the same period in 2019. Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, bought 9% of homes in June, down from 14% in May. 

""The resilience of home prices, particularly given the rise in mortgages delinquency rates and increased use of forbearance, has likely pulled many investors to the sidelines,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate in June posted its biggest jump in more than nine years as restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus outbreak were lifted, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
The rate jumped to 0.7% from a 0.4% decline in May but was still well below the Bank of Canada's 2% target. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the annual rate to increase to 0.3%.
""It's consistent with an economy that was almost completely shut down in many ways in April but is beginning to heal over the past few months,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.
June marked the end of two months of deflation. The Bank of Canada - which says interest rates will remain near record lows for another two years - predicts inflation will remain weak in the near term.
The CPI common measure, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, edged up to 1.5% from 1.4% in May.
The main drivers of growth included recovering prices for energy, food, passenger vehicles, clothing and footwear, Statscan said.
""There is some pent up demand there. Our guess is we'll start to see some of that dissipate"" as government benefits programs end, said Mark Chandler at RBC Capital Markets.
Gasoline prices declined by 15.7% compared to a 29.8% plunge in May, mainly as demand grew with the gradual reopening of businesses and public services, Statscan said.
Meat prices climbed 8.1% from June 2019. Overall, prices rose in nine of the 10 provinces.
The Canadian dollar edged up 0.2% to C$1.3429 to the U.S. dollar, or 74.47 U.S. cents. 

The 1.1 percentage point advance from May to June matches the increase seen between February and March 2011.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output likely rebounded in June from the near double-digit decline in the previous month, in a sign factory activity may have bottomed out from the deep slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a Reuters poll of 13 economists showed.
While a relatively small rebound in factory output would point to a modest economic recovery ahead, the jobless rate was expected to creep up from decades-low levels, underscoring a more prolonged impact from the health crisis.
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) data out at 0850 JST July 31 (2350 GMT July 30) will probably show factory output grew 1.2% month-on-month in June, rebounding from a 8.9% decline in May caused by slumping output of cars and production machinery, the poll showed. An increase would snap four straight months of declines in factory output.
Although global demand for cars and other durable goods may have bottomed out as many countries have re-opened their economies, a slow rebound raised the spectre of a jobless recovery, which would undermine private consumption that accounts for more than half of the economy, analysts say.
Separate government data out 0830 JST July 31 (2330 GMT July 30) will likely show the jobless rate rose to 3.1% in June, from 2.9% seen in the previous month, the poll showed.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio, or availability of jobs, probably worsened to 1.16 in June, from 1.2 seen in May, meaning that less than six jobs were available per five job-seekers.
Worsening job conditions would hit households hard, keeping consumers from loosening purse strings as they have just emerged from lockdowns implemented through late May to contain the virus' spread.
Retail sales were seen falling 6.5% in the year to June, following a 12.5% drop the previous month, the poll showed. The data is due out at 0850 JST July 30 (2350 GMT July 29).
Japan has not seen the kind of rapid spread of the coronavirus that has killed tens of thousands in other countries. But a recent surge in new cases in Tokyo and other cities has sounded alarm bells for a country that had thought it had the virus under control.

In a sign a growing number of households cannot afford to buy a home, housing starts probably fell 13.5% in the year to June, worse than the prior month's 12.3% decline, the poll showed. The housing data is due out at 1400 JST July 31 (0500 GMT).

The drop in the CPI was in line with the median forecast among 12 economists surveyed by Reuters. In May, the index had fallen 2.9%.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 42.6 from a final 40.1 in June, as broader conditions remained fragile though the pace of decline was the slowest in four months.
""The Japanese economy continued to struggle at the start of the third quarter,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""While the easing of emergency measures provided some relief, especially to the domestic sector, Japan's growth continued to be adversely affected by subdued global trade flows and restrictions on travel.""

Japan's economy is forecast to shrink 5.3% this fiscal year, the largest contraction since comparable data became available in 1994, followed by a 3.3% bounce next year, a Reuters poll of over 30 economists showed.
Exports in June plunged at a double-digit pace for the fourth straight month, data showed on Monday, backing signs that a slump in global demand for durable goods since March due to the pandemic has thrown the economy into a deep recession.
The PMI survey also showed weakness in service-sector activity, which saw outstanding business, business expectations and employment conditions contract.

232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",South Korea GDP to Show Recession Despite Avoiding Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea slipped into a recession in the second quarter, official data are expected to show Thursday, after its no-lockdown strategy and stimulus failed to offset a slump in exports.
Gross domestic product is expected to have fallen 2.4% last quarter from January-March, according to a median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A negative outcome would mark the first recession since 2003.
South Korea took an alternative approach to handling the virus crisis, leaning on mass testing and contact tracing instead of shutting down large swathes of the economy. The government also took various initiatives to boost consumption, handing out cash to all households and encouraging retailers to offer promotions. The fiscal stimulus pledged so far amounts to 14% of GDP.
South Korea Passes Third Extra Budget to Boost Virus-Hit Economy
Yet a contraction in activity is deemed inevitable, with all-but-one of 17 economists expecting such an outcome. Widespread caution among South Koreans put a cap on spending, while lockdowns elsewhere in the world hit global trade.
“The sharp contraction in exports has offset the tentative recovery in South Korea’s domestic demand and pushed the economy into recession,” said Tieying Ma, an economist at DBS Bank. Exports have fallen by double digits through April-June.
Preliminary data compiled by the finance ministry show consumption improved steadily last quarter. Credit card approvals rose 9.3% in June from a year earlier, but tourism has almost ground to a halt. Chinese visitor numbers have fallen by 99% from the previous year in each month since March.
Early Recession Exit
Korea’s downturn, however, is expected to be shorter and less painful than in other countries. Most economists see growth returning in the current quarter.
Economists expect South Korea’s economy to shrink 0.6% this year, smaller than the -4.9% expected for Japan, -5.8% for Singapore and -5.5% for the U.S.
Korea is well positioned for a second-half rebound from the exports of semiconductors and its economic ties with China, the only major economy forecast to grow in 2020, according to Rory Green, an economist at TS Lombard.
“Consumer and business sentiment has now bottomed, and I expect the economy to bounce back strongly as global demand slowly recovers,” Green said. South Korea’s semiconductor industry will benefit from the global shift to working from home, and exports to China look set to strengthen amid Beijing’s infrastructure stimulus, he added.
Lingering Uncertainty
Uncertainty lingers, with a resurgence of the virus the major risk to the outlook. Spiraling caseloads in Hong Kong and Australia -- both previously lauded for their successes -- are a warning that the situation can quickly change.
Government policy focus needs to pivot from helping businesses and households survive the pandemic, toward preparing for a post-pandemic world. The implementation of President Moon Jae-in’s New Deal initiative to reshape the economy around tech and green industries will be scrutinized for its effectiveness in supporting growth, said Kyle Ferrier, Director of Academic Affairs at Korea Economic Institute of America.

Market researcher Nielsen said the growth was down from 14% in last month's report. The government allowed pubs, cafes and restaurants in England to reopen on July 4, giving people an alternative to eating at home.
Nielsen said online grocery purchases leapt 115% year-on-year, accounting for a record 14% of all grocery spending in the United Kingdom.
Morrisons (L:MRW) was the best performer of Britain's so-called ""big four"" supermarket groups in the 12 weeks to July 11, with sales growth of 15.7%, followed by market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO) with growth of 12% and No. 2  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY) with growth of 10.2%. Walmart (N:WMT) owned Asda was again the laggard with growth of 8.7%.
The big four's growth was dwarfed by Iceland, whose sales surged 30.4% as shoppers bought more frozen food.
German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl saw a marginal loss of market share, partly reflecting their lack of a major online offer.
Looking at the full 16 week UK lockdown period, Nielsen said shoppers spent a total of 49 billion pounds ($62 billion) on groceries, tobacco and general merchandise - an extra 3.2 billion pounds compared with the same period last year. 

Shopping habits also changed, with the number of visits down but the amount spent on each visit up. Also of the incremental spend, 47% of it was made at convenience stores, Nielsen found.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices snapped two straight months of declines in June but risks remain for a prolonged economic slump from the coronavirus crisis, which has depressed consumption and raised concerns about a return to deflation.
The core consumer price index (CPI) was flat, with slower falls in energy prices in June helping the gauge out of negative territory. The reading dashed expectations for a third straight month of decline and followed central bank comments last week that the economy would likely shake off the hit from the pandemic.
Japan lifted nationwide state of emergency measures in late May but has seen a renewed spike in infections in its capital Tokyo, stoking fears of a second wave of infections that could curtail spending in an already weakened economy.
""It is inevitable that the outlook for wage environment will become severe as firms could cut bonuses and payments due to significant deterioration in corporate earnings,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""We can't expect a V-shaped economic recovery and a lack of demand including that of overseas could become chronic, so downward pressure on prices could strengthen.""
The core CPI, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was flat in June from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday.
That compared with the median market forecast of a 0.1% decline and falls of 0.2% reported in both April and May.
The so-called core-core price index, which excludes food and energy prices and is closely tracked by the central bank as a narrower gauge of inflation, grew 0.4% in June after the same rate of gain in May. 
The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) latest quarterly forecasts showed consumer prices projected to fall 0.5% this fiscal year to next March and stay well below its 2% target through early 2023.
The economy likely contracted more than 20% in April-June as the coronavirus hit global growth and the government shut down the economy from April to late May.

Researcher Springboard said shopper numbers, or footfall, across all retail destinations in the United Kingdom increased by 4.5% in the week to July 18 from the week before.
That compared to growth of 10.6% in the week to July 11.
Britain's retailers, already struggling with high rents, business taxes, tight margins and online competition, were particularly hammered by the lockdown. Thousands of job losses have already been announced.
""Last week demonstrated that the longed-for flood of shoppers returning to bricks and mortar destinations and retail stores once again became a trickle,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's insights director.
All of the rise was driven by high streets and shopping centres, where footfall rose by 6.8% and 4.7% respectively, while it declined by 0.7% in retail parks.
Wehrle noted that while the extent of the rise in footfall from the week before was not as significant as hoped, it was enough to reduce the year-on-year decline to 40.2%, which was the most modest since the start of the lockdown.
Earlier this month finance minister Rishi Sunak said the government would encourage trade by funding discounts on eating out on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August, and also slashed value-added tax for the hospitality and domestic tourism sector.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders grew at their fastest pace in nearly two years in June, boosted by strong demand for telecommuting products such as laptops, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions of people around the world to work from home.
The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, jumped 6.5% in June from a year earlier to $41 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Monday.
The outcome exceeded a 1.2% rise projected in a Reuters poll and a 0.4% increase in May. It was the fourth consecutive month of gains and the strongest since August 2018.
The ministry, which has repeatedly warned of a difficult outlook for orders because of the coronavirus pandemic, said the better-than-expected performance was due to strong demand for semiconductors and telecommuting products. 
Strong electronics orders, including smartphones, which grew 23.9% on year also contributed to growth, the ministry said. 
The boom in telecommuting demand, however, could slow down in the coming months and uncertainties from the pandemic as well as China-U.S. trade tensions could still harm Taiwan's exports, said Huang Yu-ling, director of the ministry's statistics agency. 
""The pandemic has not slowed down in Europe and America, so the development could affect whether those orders actually come through in the end,"" Huang said. 
The ministry said it expects July export orders to be in a range of -0.6% to +3.1% from a year earlier.
Taiwan's manufacturers, a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], have been hit hard by faltering global demand for electronics in the wake of social curbs and lockdowns in many countries.
June orders from the United States rose 13.6% from a year earlier, compared with 8.6% growth in May, while those from China were up 13% versus a 2.7% gain the previous month. European orders rose 10.8%, and those from Japan dropped 5.2%.
Taiwan's economic growth slowed to its weakest in nearly four years in the first quarter as the pandemic crimped domestic consumption and tourism.

In response, the government stepped up support measures and is rolling out a stimulus package it expects will eventually be worth T$1.05 trillion ($35 billion).

LONDON (Reuters) - British households' view of their financial situation improved modestly in July to just above its long-run average, after hitting an eight-and-a-half year low in April due to the coronavirus, a survey showed on Monday.
IHS Markit said its monthly Household Finance Index rose to 41.5 in July from 40.7 in June, though it is below its level in March before the economy went into lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has killed over 45,000 people in Britain.
""The phased reopening across parts of the UK economy appears to have been a factor supporting household finances in July,"" IHS Markit said, after households reported a slight improvement in their incomes and amount of work.
Non-essential shops in England reopened on June 15, and pubs and restaurants started serving again on July 4.
However, unemployment is forecast to increase dramatically later this year when a temporary government scheme that has support more than 9 million jobs ends in October.
Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility said last week that under its central scenario, the jobless rate would reach 11.9% in the final quarter of this year, matching a post-World War Two high set in 1984.
Monday's survey showed 31% of people felt their jobs were less secure than before.
""Large numbers of households are therefore maintaining the cautious spending habits adopted during the early stages of the pandemic and are now focussed on paying down debt and saving where possible,"" IHS Markit director Tim Moore said.

Bank of England data showed a record fall in the amount of money borrowed on credit cards in April and a further big drop in May, due to reduced spending opportunities and consumers' fears for the future.

The one-year loan prime rate (LPR)  was kept unchanged at 3.85%, while the five-year LPR  remained at 4.65%.
Most new and outstanding loans are based on the LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
Thirty-four out of 36 participants in a Reuters survey had expected no adjustment to LPR in July after the People's Bank of China kept borrowing cost on medium-term lending facility (MLF) unchanged last week.
MLF, one of the PBOC's main tools in managing longer-term liquidity in the banking system, serves as a guide for the LPR.
The interest rate on one-year MLF loans to financial institutions  also stayed unchanged at 2.95% for three straight months.
Against the backdrop of improving economic data, analysts and economists said policymakers have started to shift away from powerful, emergency monetary easing to more targeted schemes to help areas of the economy that are still struggling. Policymakers are also concerned that too much stimulus could stoke more debt and financial risks.
Official data showed China's economy grew 3.2% in the second-quarter from a year earlier, faster than the 2.5% expected by analysts, as lockdown measures ended and policymakers ramped up stimulus after a record, virus-induced contraction early in the year.

The LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. The PBOC revamped the mechanism to price LPR in August 2019, loosely pegging it to the MLF rate.

Accountants Deloitte said 49% of chief financial officers from large and mostly listed companies forecast a return to pre-pandemic levels of business only in the latter half of next year.
Another 33% predicted a recovery in the first half of 2021 and 10% said business had already bounced back.
The survey chimed with other gauges of business sentiment, such as the Bank of England's Decision Makers' Panel, which show companies expect a lasting hit from the virus outbreak that has killed more than 45,000 people in the United Kingdom.
Deloitte said companies were resolutely downbeat about the outlook for jobs, investment and adding risk to their balance sheet, although less so than in its previous quarterly survey.
""Major corporates are expecting a long haul back to pre-COVID levels of revenue,"" said Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist.
""COVID-19 overshadows all other sources of risk for UK CFOs, and by a wide margin.""
Separately, manufacturing trade body Make UK on Monday called for the government to extend its job furlough scheme, due to expire at the end of October, by six months for key industrial sectors.
A Bank of England scenario published in May showed the economy regaining its pre-pandemic size by the second half of next year, but evidence for the kind of ""V""-shaped recovery that would be needed is patchy.
""At present, the prospect of a V-shaped recovery for industry seems remote,"" said Stephen Phipson, Make UK chief executive.
""Therefore, if we are to mitigate the worst impact of potential job losses Government must extend the furlough scheme for key strategic sectors to provide them with vital breathing space.""
The economy could shrink by more than 14% this year if there is lasting damage from the coronavirus, a scenario that would push government borrowing to nearly half a trillion dollars, government budget forecasters said last week.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Friday that Britain's economy was starting to recover from its coronavirus lockdown but some job-intense sectors remained weak and the longer-term outlook was unclear.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>","Flight to suburbs boosts U.S. homebuilding, but COVID-19 surge erodes consumer sentiment","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding increased in June by the most in nearly four years amid reports of rising demand for housing in suburbs and rural areas as companies allow employees to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
But a resurgence in new coronavirus infections across the country eroded consumer sentiment in mid-July, other data showed on Friday, threatening the nascent housing and economic recovery. Some areas in virus hot spots in the populous South and West regions have either shut down businesses again or paused reopenings.
The economy slipped into recession in February. 
""Home building is coming back at a steady, if unspectacular pace,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The numbers also verify that many people are leaving, or planning to leave, big cities as telecommuting becomes the norm for many businesses."" 
Housing starts increased 17.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.186 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. The percentage gain was the largest since October 2016. Data for May was revised up to a 1.011 million-unit pace from the previously reported 974,000.
Still, homebuilding remains 24.3% below its February level. The South and the West accounted for about 75% of housing starts last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts increasing to a rate of 1.169 million units. 
A survey on Thursday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders vaulting in July to levels that prevailed before the coronavirus crisis upended the economy in March.
Builders reported increased demand for single-family homes in lower density markets, including small metro areas, rural markets and large metro suburbs. The public health crisis has shifted office work from commercial business districts to homes, a trend that economists predict could become permanent.
Demand for housing is being supported by cheaper mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 2.98%, the lowest since 1971, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
But with a staggering 32 million Americans collecting unemployment checks and lumber prices at a two-year high, a robust housing market is unlikely. Unemployment could worsen as new cases of the respiratory illness sky-rocket without a coordinated national effort to control the spread of the virus. 
In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index dropped to a reading of 73.2 in mid-July ""due to the widespread resurgence of the coronavirus"" from 78.1 in June. It warned further declines were likely in the months ahead. 
The United States reported at least 77,000 new COVID-19 cases nationwide on Thursday, a record daily jump in known infections for the seventh time this month, according to a Reuters tally.
""Sentiment will likely remain subdued in the absence of a more substantial health response that will result in better virus containment and prevent repeated closures that will cause more permanent damage to the labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors worried about the explosion in coronavirus cases. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BUILDING PERMITS RISE
Home building last month was boosted by a 17.2% jump in the construction of singe-family housing units, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, to a rate of 831,000 units. Groundbreaking activity increased in the Midwest, South and Northeast, but fell in the West.
Starts are likely to advance further in the coming months. Permits for future homebuilding rose 2.1% to a rate of 1.241 million units in June, placing them well ahead of starts. Single-family building permits shot up 11.8% to a rate of 834,000 units. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment jumped 17.5% to a pace of 355,000 units. But multi-family building permits dropped 13.4% to a rate of 407,000 units.
""There had been a trend to multi-family construction but this could be reversed if the experience with the pandemic results in the reported urban flight becoming a longer-run phenomenon,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 

There was also a rise last month in housing completions, though the stock of homes under construction dipped. That, together with increased groundbreaking and building permits, could help to ease an acute shortage of homes for sale that has constrained the housing market.

Residential starts jumped to an annualized rate of 1.19 million, according to a government report released Friday. That matched the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The month-over-month increase was the biggest since October 2016, while the rate remains 4% below the level in June 2019.
Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, climbed 2.1% to a 1.24 million rate, missing estimates. The Commerce Department said single-family starts rose 17% compared with a month earlier.
Builders were hammered when the coronavirus outbreak shut down the U.S. economy in March and froze the real estate market. But the stocks of those companies have rallied, with an index that tracks the industry closing on Thursday at its highest level since March 4.
Rates Slide
The tumble in mortgage rates, which dipped below 3% this week, has fueled a flood of applications for loans to purchase homes. But with with virus cases spiking across the U.S., there are fears that the economic recovery could stall. High unemployment and a possible second wave of Covid-19 are also risks for the housing market.
Inventory of existing homes has been tight as some sellers, wary of listing amid the shaky economy, have stayed on the sidelines. That means new houses are taking a bigger share of the market, according to Matthew Pointon, U.S. property economist at Capital Economics.
Buying a new home is a convenient option during a pandemic because so much can be done without leaving the house, from virtual tours to getting a mortgage from the builder, he said. And some buyers are eager to leave cities and move to the suburbs where new home communities are sprouting, he said.
“Homebuilders will be keen to ramp up production -- their confidence has already bounced back from the dip,” Pointon said. “Some people prefer getting a newer, cleaner home rather than a dirty old one because of the virus.”"

Fiscal revenues have been gradually recovering in the second quarter after a deep decline in the first three months, ministry official Liu Jinyun told a briefing.
China's economy returned to growth in the second quarter after a deep slump at the beginning of the year, but weak demand underscored the need for more policy support for the recovery after the shock of the novel coronavirus crisis.
For the first half, fiscal revenues fell 10.8% from a year earlier to 9.6176 trillion yuan, while fiscal spending fell 5.8% to 11.6411 trillion yuan, the ministry said.
Tax revenues fell 11.3% in the first half, while non-tax revenues were down 8%, it said.
China has issued 720 billion yuan ($102.89 billion) in special treasury bonds as of July 16, accounting for 72% of the planned issuance that could be completed by the end of July, Liu said.
In May, the government said it would issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds to support employment, expand consumption and investment.
The government will also let local governments issue 3.75 trillion yuan worth of special bonds to fund investment projects. 
The cabinet said this week that local governments had issued 2.24 trillion yuan in special bonds by mid-July, of which 1.9 trillion yuan had been spent.
Funds raised from local government special bonds must be used for projects with certain returns and cannot be used to pay wages or pensions, finance ministry official Wang Kebing told the briefing.
The ministry had issued a fourth batch of a local government special bond quota of 1.26 trillion yuan, on top of previous tranches totalling 2.29 trillion yuan, Wang said.
The government will prevent risks from local government debt and will not relax controls due to the coronavirus, Wang said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports likely tumbled at a double-digit pace for the fourth month in a row in June, as the coronavirus epidemic took a heavy toll on global demand and the country's export-led economy, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Global demand for cars and other durable goods has plunged since March as the pandemic prompted many countries to lockdown, forcing businesses to shut and people to stay at home.
Though more countries have started re-opening their economies and activity has likely bottomed out, policymakers and analysts play down the prospects for a sharp recovery in global demand.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect data on Monday will show Japan's exports fell 24.9% in June from a year earlier, following a 28.3% fall in May, which was the biggest annual decline since September 2009.
Imports probably fell 16.8%, versus a 26.2% drop in the previous month, resulting in a trade deficit of 35.8 billion yen ($333.96 million), the poll of 16 economists showed.
""Both exports and imports are likely to show signs of bottoming out,"" said Kenta Maruyama, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
""While China-bound shipments will lead a recovery, Europe and America as well as car-related demand are slow to recover. As such, fully-fledged Japanese export recovery will be delayed into autumn or later."" 
A private factory survey for June had indicated new orders remained deep in contraction territory. 
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will release the trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (2350 GMT Sunday). 
Weak demand is also keeping a lid on prices, stoking fears of a return to deflation, which is defined as a prolonged period of declines.
Other major data next week is expected to show the core consumer price index, excluding fresh food prices but including oil product costs, fell 0.1% year-on-year in June, but marginally less than a 0.2% decline in the previous month.

Foreign outflows from the U.S. Treasury market totaled $27.7 billion in May, compared with outflows of $176.5 billion the previous month. In April, Treasuries saw a record outflow of $299 billion.
At the same time, however, foreign investors purchased $79.7 billion of U.S. equities in May, an all-time high. In April, foreigners sold $8.6 billion in stocks.
U.S. corporate bonds saw an inflow for a third consecutive month of $13.6 billion, from an inflow of $10.94 billion the previous month.
""If you look at the transactions data, there was a pro-risk pivot in May,"" said Jon Hill, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital in New York.
""There was net selling of Treasuries, and a decline in agency buying, but net buying of corporate bonds and equities. It seems like some of the foreign private investors helped push that rally in May as the Federal Reserve's liquidity programs were kicking in,"" he added.
Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yields ended May at 0.64%, mostly, steady for most of the month, after hitting a record low of 0.318% (US10YT=RR) in March.
Data also showed that Japan remained the largest non-U.S. largest holder of Treasuries during the month, although its holdings declined to $1.26 trillion in May, from $1.266 trillion in April.
China's holdings of Treasuries, however, rose to $1.08 trillion in May, from $1.07 trillion in April. The country is the second largest non-U.S. holder of U.S. government debt.
Overall, foreign holdings of U.S. Treasuries rose by about $80 billion in May to $6.86 trillion, after hitting an all-time peak of $7.066 trillion in March.

(Reuters) - The U.S. economic recovery showed signs of plateauing last week as the country battled rising coronavirus case counts and an increasingly fractured government response, according to data from a broad set of industry and government sources.
Indexes measuring the national recovery from the New York Federal Reserve https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/weekly-economic-index, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/topics/covid-19.html and Oxford Economics https://www.oxfordeconomics.com have all largely stalled. Meanwhile real-time measures of retail foot traffic https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard and employee work hours https://joinhomebase.com/data and shifts have flatlined after steady growth since April spawned optimism for a swift rebound from the recession triggered by the global pandemic. 
At the same time, evidence of retrenchment is spreading beyond the high-profile examples of Texas, Florida and California, major state economies where efforts to reopen commerce have been thrown into reverse by fresh restrictions to stop the spread of the COVID-19 disease.
Since the beginning of the fight against the pandemic the aim has been to ""flatten the curve"" - meaning stem the growth in infections. Instead, four months in, it may be the wrong curve that is flattening as the recovery slows while the virus surges ahead.
Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said on Thursday the early strength of the recovery surprised him, but ""the question is as we have gotten to this point what should we expect moving forward.""
""Real-time evidence suggests there is a bit more reticence in the economy,"" he said.
Data from cellphone tracking firm Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard as of July 3 showed more than half of states saw retail traffic surpass 2019 levels. A week later the number had slipped to 11, most of them rural, less-populated places like Maine and Montana.

In industrial states including Iowa and Indiana where retail traffic has exceeded 2019 levels, case counts are growing - suggesting there is no clear template yet in place for how to reopen the economy in a way that preserves public health.
""People did have that initial impetus to reengage. Now we see a spike in infections and that is going to put a damper on the recovery,"" said Elizabeth Crofoot, a senior economist at the Conference Board, an organization of major companies. 
The board published a survey this week concluding that U.S. consumer confidence had been driven lower in part by lack of trust in the government's ability to control the pandemic, and would likely remain ""depressed"" for a sustained time. 
More notably, she said ""the trust factor, the mixed messages from local government, the federal government,"" would likely drive people from the marketplace regardless of any formal restrictions imposed or lifted by authorities.
COVER YOUR FACE
The last week put those mixed messages on stark display. 
As the daily growth in cases continued to set records, topping 60,000, the Trump administration was battling with state and local governments over whether to reopen schools and the adequacy of testing and challenging the credibility of the nation's top infectious disease expert.
Nearly than 3.6 million Americans have now been infected and more than 137,000 have died during the pandemic.
The news is not all grim. Death rates in recent weeks have remained low compared with the earliest days of the pandemic, and some argue the country is going through a ""learning"" phase that will see individuals and companies develop their own ways to cope with the persistence of the disease.
Mask usage has become less stigmatized - Wal-Mart Inc (N:WMT) is making them mandatory as of Monday - and a Cleveland Fed survey of 1,141 U.S. consumers https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/2020-economic-commentaries/ec-202020-survey-results-on-mask-wearing-behaviors-and-beliefs.aspx published Thursday showed nearly 90% said they wore a mask the last time they were in a public indoor space such as a store.
In comments to reporters last week St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he thought individuals and businesses would adopt ways to manage their lives and their firms safely - with masks and social distancing likely to become a broadly accepted norm even after months in which they've been a topic of political dispute.
""These businesses have strong incentives to get their revenue streams back,"" he said. ""They can pretend there is not a disease. They will get punched in the face. Workers get sick. Customers get sick ... Learning occurs.""
Nor is the economic data uniformly bad. Retail sales jumped 7.5% in June as states lifted coronavirus restrictions and summer arrived.
But even that may be illusory.
A recent study by the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Institute concluded that expanded unemployment benefits approved in response to the pandemic allowed those thrown out of work to actually increase their spending. Those benefits expire at the end of this month.
Jobs, meanwhile, may not be returning fast enough to take up the slack. Another 1.3 million people filed for unemployment https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/DataDashboard.asp insurance last week , and several states that had tried to aggressively reopen their economies saw large jumps in ongoing unemployment claims as virus cases exploded and new restrictions were imposed.

Nationally, data from time management firm Kronos https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/update-us-workforce-activity across a variety of industries showed work shifts for the week ending July 12 declined for the first time since mid-April, excluding the Memorial Day and July 4 holiday weeks when some businesses may have closed or reduced hours.

261,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 12:31PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales snap back; high unemployment, rising COVID-19 loom over recovery","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in June as consumers bought big-ticket items like motor vehicles and dined out, but a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases is chipping at the budding recovery, keeping 32 million Americans on unemployment benefits.
Economists attributed the second straight monthly increase in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday to the government's additional weekly $600 checks for the unemployed, a benefit that is set to end on July 31. The expiration of the program will leave millions of gig workers and the self employed among others, who do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance, without an income.
Economists warned this would undercut consumer spending and the overall economy at a time when new cases of the coronavirus are sky-rocketing, especially in the densely populated South and West, and forcing some authorities in these regions to either close businesses again or pause reopenings. 
""The road ahead for the consumer looks a little foggy and uncertain to say the least,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""July spending faces the headwinds of states closing back down due to the second wave of the coronavirus. August spending is in doubt because those extra $600 a week unemployment checks stop at the end of July."" 
Retail sales rose 7.5% last month after jumping 18.2% in May, which was the biggest gain since the government started tracking the series in 1992. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales advancing 5% in June.
Retail sales have rebounded as businesses resumed operations after being shuttered in mid-March in an effort to slow the spread of the respiratory illness. Retail sales in June were driven by an 8.2% increase in receipts at auto dealerships. Consumers stepped up spending at furniture, clothing, electronics and appliance, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Receipts at restaurants and bars shot up 20.0%. 
But online and mail-order retail sales fell 2.4%. Sales also fell at building material and grocery stores.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid worries about the explosion in coronavirus cases. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RECOVERY STALLING
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 5.6% in June after increasing 10.1% in May. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the gross domestic product report.
The rebound in core retail sales did not change expectations consumer spending collapsed in the second quarter. It, however, set spending on a higher growth path for the third quarter. 
Economists expect consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, declined at as much as a 35% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. That could result in GDP falling at around a 31% pace in that period. The economy shrank at a 5% pace in the January-March quarter, the sharpest contraction since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
""Activity snapped back in May and June, albeit to levels below those which prevailed prior to the pandemic,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""More recently, several high-frequency indicators suggest that May and June were the easy months, and that the resurgence of COVID-19 cases is leading to slower activity gains in July.""
Separately on Thursday, the Labor Department said 1.30 million people filed for state unemployment benefits during the week ending July 11, down 10,000 from the prior period. Economists had forecast 1.250 million claims last week. 
The weekly jobless claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, showed big increases in California, Georgia, Florida and Washington state, which are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases. 
First-time claims peaked at a historic 6.867 million in late March. They remain roughly double their highest point during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Including a program funded by the government, 2.23 million people filed claims last week. 
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 422,000 to 17.338 million in the week ending July 4. These so-called continued claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, topped out at a record 24.912 million in early May. 
There were 32 million people receiving unemployment checks under all programs in the last week of June, down 433,005 from the prior week. According to economists, this number, which is reported with a two-week lag, offered a more accurate reading of the labor market.
Economists say unemployment remains uncomfortably high because of a second wave of layoffs, which could intensify as the COVID-19 infections depress demand and increase bankruptcies, especially in the retail sector. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said on Wednesday it was sending 25,000 notices of potential furloughs to frontline workers.

""The data are likely underestimating the true state of the labor market,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Firms are starting to warn there could be major layoffs in the months to come.""

262,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories post record drop in May,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories fell by the most on record in May amid the COVID-19 crisis, supporting expectations for the sharpest drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter since the Great Depression.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday business inventories declined 2.3% in May, the biggest decline since the government started tracking the series in 1992, after falling 1.4% in April. Inventories, a key component of GDP, have now declined for five straight months.
May's plunge in business stocks was in line with economists' expectations.
Retail inventories plummeted 6.2% in May, instead of 6.1 as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 3.8% drop in April. Motor vehicle inventories tumbled 14.9% rather than 15% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, fell 1.6% instead of 1.5% as reported last month.
Goods imports decreased in May to their lowest level since July 2010 as the coronavirus crisis suppressed demand and upended global trade. Imports have also been curbed by the White House's trade war with China. Though the shrinking import bill is a positive in the calculation of GDP, it has been overshadowed by an even bigger decline in exports.
That has led a widening of the trade deficit, which together with the continued inventory drawdown are expected to contribute to the deepest decline in GDP on record. The economy contracted at a 5.0% annualized rate in the first quarter, the sharpest pace of decline in GDP since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
The economy fell into recession is February. Economists expect GDP shrank at a pace as sharp as 35% in the April-June quarter. The government will publish its advance second-quarter GDP estimate at the end of the month.
Wholesale inventories fell 1.2% in May. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.2%. Business sales rebounded 8.4% in May after tumbling 14.4% in the prior month. At May's sales pace, it would take 1.51 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.67 months in April.

Investing.com -- The improvement in the U.S. labor market since April appeared to be petering out Thursday, after fresh data showed the number of people making initial claims for unemployment benefits in the U.S. was almost unchanged last week at 1.300 million. 
Labor Department data released on Thursday showed that was only a 10,000 decline from a revised figure of 1.310 million for the previous week. Analysts had expected the number to fall by much more to 1.25 million.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, fell more sharply than expected to 17.338 million. The previous week's figure was also revised downwards to 17.600 million. The decline in continuing claims is, however, linked not just to the number of people finding new jobs, but those dropping out of the workforce by stopping their search for work.
More positively, the Commerce Department said that U.S. retail sales rose by 7.5% in June, down from May's record jump (which was revised up to 18.2%) but still more than the 5.0% expected.  Core retail sales, which exclude automobiles, rose 7.3%.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Slowing UK job losses seen as 'calm before storm',"By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Fewer British workers lost their jobs in June and there were other signs that the hit to the labour market had eased off since the onset of the coronavirus crisis, but economists said unemployment remained on course to jump.
The number of employees on company payrolls slumped by 649,000 between March and June, despite the government's huge job retention plan that has protected more than 9 million jobs.
However, June's drop of just over 74,000 was much smaller than April's 450,000 tumble and was smaller than the fall in May too, the Office for National Statistics said.
The unemployment rate unexpectedly held at 3.9% in the three months to May. It would have risen were it not for half a million people who were away from work and receiving no pay - but who said they believed they still had a job, and thus count as employed according to international guidelines. 
A rise in people who were not looking for work also pushed down on the jobless rate.
Most economists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to rise to 4.2%.
Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said the data represented ""the calm before the storm... but as the Job Retention Scheme unwinds in coming months, the full impact of the recession on unemployment is likely to be revealed."" 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak plans to phase out the scheme by the end of October. Last week he announced 30 billion pounds of new measures to stem an expected surge in unemployment.
Since then a string of companies have announced layoff plans ranging from private security firm G4S (L:GFS) to retailers Boots and John Lewis.
A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce showed 29% of companies expected to lay off staff in the third quarter.
""It's clear that we're in the middle of a severe economic downturn,"" Sunak said after Thursday's data. ""As I said last week, we will never accept unemployment as an unavoidable outcome.""
Britain's budget forecasters say the unemployment rate could rise as high as 13% this year, exceeding a previous post-war high of 11.9% set in 1984.
The ONS said the number of people in employment in the three months to May fell by the most since 2011, down 126,000, driven mostly by self-employed people.
But the fall was only about half as severe as the median forecast in a Reuters poll.
The number of people claiming Universal Credit welfare unexpectedly fell in June by 28,100 to 2.631 million, but remained more than double its figure in March. The figure includes people who are in low-paid work.
The number of vacancies fell in the three months to June to the lowest level since records began in 2001 at 333,000.
But a monthly breakdown showed a slight increase in vacancies in June alone.
Similarly, hours worked slumped to a record low average in the March-May period, reflecting the job retention scheme. But weekly data showed signs of a slight pick-up recently.
The data also showed a hit to pay reflecting how most people on job retention scheme receive 80% of their pay.

Average total pay, including bonuses, fell by an annual -0.3%, the first negative figure since 2014 and its biggest fall since 2009.

267,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 01:06AM ET</span>","China Avoids Recession, but Faces Long Road Ahead to Economic Recovery","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China reported a slew of economic data on Thursday that showed the world’s second largest economy avoiding a recession in the second quarter. But it still faces an uphill battle on its path to economic recovery from COVID-19.
The National Bureau of Statistics said that GDP grew 3.2% year-on-year for the second quarter, beating analyst expectations of a 2.5% increase and reversing the previous quarter’s 6.8% decline. It also reported that June’s industrial production was up by 4.8% year-on-year, but retail sales were down 1.8% year-on-year.
The unemployment rate was 5.7%, down from the previous month’s 5.9%.
Thursday's data followed the release of positive customs data on Tuesday. The Chinese government also announced stimulus measures, such as tax and fee cuts, cheaper loans, and increased fiscal spending to deal with the virus’ economic impact during the National People's Congress in May. Despite the better-than-expected GDP, the fall in retail sales figures indicated weak consumer sentiment, with the measures falling below those rolled out in other countries.
A major hurdle on China’s path to recovery continues to be the unemployment level attributable to the manufacturing sector’s collapse in the previous quarter. There are concerns that the decline in the unemployment rate does not capture the full picture, with the rate expected to be higher than reported.
“The message is clear here that China’s recovery is much stronger than the rest of world, largely benefiting from the effective epidemic control and the orderly normalization procedure,” Zhu Haibin, Chief China Economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), told Bloomberg.
But he warned, “In the second half, the momentum of further recovery will be softer.”"
268,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 16, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>","Good News, China's Growing Again. Just Don't Ask How","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For all the talk about the pandemic producing a new normal, China’s economic picture sure looks a lot like the past. Exports and industrial production are moving ahead, and the government has big plans for infrastructure spending. Shoppers have taken a back seat, constrained by social distancing and job losses. Not so long ago, consumers were seen as the vanguard of a rebalanced economy, which grew to become the world’s second largest. Relying on shipments abroad, factories and massive public works was considered passe. This tilt backward is borne out in the data. On Thursday, China reported gross domestic product increased 3.2% from a year earlier. That’s better than forecast and a big improvement from the 6.8% decline during the first three months of the year.
Yet the bright spots carry their own complications. Industrial production climbed 4.8% in June and has recovered to pre-virus levels. Retail sales, the weakest link in the rebound, disappointed again, sliding 1.8% instead of the anticipated increase. Meanwhile, a separate report Tuesday showed both exports and imports gaining; the trade surplus shrank. This mix is understandable, but it’s not where Beijing wants to be. Through the past decade, no communique from the International Monetary Fund, G-20 or any multilateral organization was complete without references to the need to reposition China’s economy. Investment in the mainland by Western manufacturers, relatively cheap exports, factory job losses in the U.S. and a managed currency created political headaches.
For its part, China has been moving away from low-end production, where it was no longer overwhelmingly competitive. An expanding middle class could increasingly afford what was made at home and became an attractive lure for consumer icons like  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). and Hollywood studios. The shift suited everybody. Suffice it to say, Beijing hasn’t ditched rebalancing as a policy objective. Rather, circumstances have conspired against it. Further strides in containing Covid-19 or the arrival of a vaccine might the consumer economy return in full vigor. That would be welcome, given China powered a third of global consumption growth from 2010 to 2017, according to the McKinsey Global Institute.
Until then, relying on factories and exports is a precarious place to be. Ultimately, other countries must have sufficient demand to keep buying China’s stuff. A slow and uneven global recovery makes this a dicey proposition — even more so, given the economic competition between Washington and Beijing.
China's short-term growth drivers could end up constraining expansion in months, if not years, to come. Any hint of recovery is also a thin foundation on which to base hopes of a significant rebound in the rest of the world. Beijing’s ability to generate a bounce within Asia appears limited. For the first time in living memory, the region will suffer a contraction this year, according to the IMF.
It's important to remember, too, that China was able to record growth because it went into a shutdown earlier than most countries and was able to resume sooner. Its authoritarian political system could impose the kind of crackdown that has challenged democracies, especially the U.S., where something as straightforward as wearing a mask has become a front in a culture war. Many economists project a significant rebound in the global economy in the third quarter after a horrendous couple of months. China may be offering an advance peek at the scale of the initial revival and it isn’t brilliant. Few observers still cling to the idea of a V-shaped recovery.
China’s second-quarter expansion is better than a repeat of the fiasco in the first three months of the year. It’s nevertheless a recovery in minor key. Wouldn’t it be ironic if, instead of shattering the pre-existing world, Covid-19 returned economic conditions to more familiar terrain?

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected growth to quicken slightly to 4.7% year-on-year, from gains of 4.4% gain in May and 3.9% in April, as more businesses resumed production after the easing of lockdowns put in place to contain the virus which emerged in China late last year. 
Retail sales fell 1.8% on-year, much worse than a predicted 0.3% growth, after a 2.8% drop in May.
Sales fell for five straight months as shops, restaurants and other crowded places closed during the pandemic. Though strict containment measures have been relaxed, consumer demand has not responded correspondingly in a sign of the far reaching impact of the coronavirus. 
Fixed asset investment fell 3.1% in the first half of the year from the same period last year, compared with a forecast 3.3% fall and a 6.3% decline in the first five months of the year.

The growth was faster than the 2.5% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll, and followed a steep 6.8% slump in the first quarter, the first such contraction since at least 1992 when quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) records began.
The economy fell 1.6% in the first six months from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
The world's second-largest economy has been recovering slowly in the past two months, though the bounce from the pandemic-induced downturn has been uneven. The government has rolled out a raft of measures, including more fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the coronavirus-ravaged economy and support employment.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 11.5% in April-June, the bureau said, compared with expectations for a 9.6% rise and a 9.8% decline in the previous quarter.

Gross domestic product expanded 3.2% in the three months to June from a year ago, reversing a 6.8% decline in the first quarter and beating the median forecast of 2.4%. In the first half however, output is still down 1.6% on the same period in 2019.
Having shut its economy in the first quarter to arrest the virus spread and managed so far to largely defeat subsequent outbreaks, China is claiming global leadership in dealing with the deadly disease. Yet a conservative stimulus approach has produced only a modest economic recovery, and one that remains highly vulnerable to setbacks in external demand as shutdowns continue to hamper global activity.
Further details in Thursday’s data release:
“China’s economy staged a sharp, but also highly uneven recovery in the second quarter,” economists at Macquarie Bank Ltd. led by Larry Hu wrote in a note before the data. “Given such a low base in 1Q, a V-shaped recovery is widely expected, but the slope is still a positive surprise.”
Today’s data showed the recovery is still largely industry-driven, while consumer sentiment remains weaker than expected. A raft of measures have been rolled out since the pandemic to shore up the economy, including tax and fee cuts, cheaper loans, and increased fiscal spending. Stimulus has still fallen far short of the policies offered in developed economies, out of concern for debt buildup and financial stability.
A major headwind to the recovery is the level of unemployment created by the collapse in manufacturing in the first quarter. The surveyed unemployment rate doesn’t capture the full impact, and tens of millions may still be out of work due to the pandemic.
Policy makers are also signaling that monetary and fiscal policy won’t become much more supportive, as long as credit growth continues its upward trend.
“The recovery is likely to slow down considerably from here,” economists at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) led by Zhou Hao wrote in a note before the data. “This is because the marked deterioration in the labor market is putting the brakes on private consumption, and the high level of corporate debt is holding back investment.”

A record 210,800 positions were added, more than double economists’ 100,000 estimate, after May’s figures were revised higher to 264,100 jobs lost, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday in Sydney. The unemployment rate advanced to 7.4% in June from 7.1% as the participation rate surged to 64% from 62.7% in May.
The Australian dollar extended earlier declines to trade down 0.2% at 69.93 U.S. cents as of 11:35 a.m. in Sydney, from 70.02 cents just before the data was released. The currency touched a one-month high of 70.63 cents on Wednesday.
The hiring spurt reflects Australia’s earlier than expected reopening of the economy following the containment of the virus. These gains are at risk of reversing with metropolitan Melbourne, the nation’s second-largest city, returning to a six-week lockdown and new cases emerging in outer Sydney.
The second wave of infections creates greater focus on the government’s fiscal and economic statement next week, when it’s due to provide an updated outlook for the next two years and lays out its intentions for the fiscal stimulus programs, given most are due to expire in September.

Britain's retailers, already struggling with high rents, business taxes, tight margins and online competition, were particularly hammered by the lockdown. Thousands of job losses have already been announced. 
The New West End Company said that without further government action, businesses in the area were facing 5 billion pounds ($6.3 billion) of lost sales. It represents 600 retail, restaurant, hotel and property owners across one of the world's top shopping and leisure destinations -- encompassing Oxford Street, Bond Street, Regent Street and Mayfair. 
The group said the West End was faring much worse than the rest of the UK, highlighting data from market researcher Springboard which showed footfall levels in UK high streets as a whole down 57.2% compared with June last year.
""What this data shows, is that city centres, significantly central London, are being held back by a series of restrictions, including uncertainty surrounding returning to work and the use of public transport,"" New West End Company said.
It called on clarity from the government to instil consumer confidence and wants a reform of tax free shopping.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 03:05PM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing snaps back; new COVID-19 cases threaten recovery,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory output rose by the most in more than 74 years in June as motor vehicle production accelerated amid the reopening of businesses, but the nascent economic recovery was overshadowed by surging new COVID-19 infections.
That was underscored by another report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday showing a pickup in activity through early July, though the outlook remained highly uncertain and depended on the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy. 
Businesses have resumed operations after being shuttered in mid-March in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But there has been a resurgence in new infections of the respiratory illness, especially in the highly populated South and West, prompting some authorities in these regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
""The manufacturing recovery will proceed at a much slower pace compared to the initial, partial snap-back phase,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The renewed flaring of virus-related uncertainty will add to significant downside risks from sharply curtailed demand, supply chain disruptions and heightened economic uncertainty."" 
The Fed said manufacturing production jumped 7.2% last month, the largest gain since March 1947, after climbing 3.8% in May. Despite two straight monthly increases, factory output was 11.1% below its level in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output rising 5.6% in June.
Production at factories contracted at a 47.0% annualized rate in the second quarter after falling at a 5.5% pace in the January-March period. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy, is also being constrained by the fallout from the Trump administration's trade war with China.
Global supply chains remain fragile and demand for crude oil is weak, leading to lower prices that are undercutting spending by oil producers on drilling and shaft exploration equipment.
Economists expect business spending to have contracted in the second quarter, the fifth straight quarterly decline. They believe gross domestic product dropped at its steepest pace in the second quarter since the Great Depression.
Separately, the Fed said in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide, economic activity increased in almost all districts through early July. 
But the U.S. central bank noted ""outlooks remained highly uncertain, as contacts grappled with how long the COVID-19 pandemic would continue and the magnitude of its economic implications."" 
That sentiment was echoed in another report from the New York Fed showing factory activity rebounding in July for the first time since February. But manufacturers in the region were less upbeat about the outlook over the next six months. 
Stocks on Wall Street rose on promising early data for a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
BROAD GAINS
Manufacturing production in June was boosted by a 105.0% surge in the output of motor vehicles and parts, which was on top of a 120% rise in May. Still, auto output remained nearly 25% below its pre-pandemic level. 
Excluding autos, manufacturing production increased 3.9%. There were increases in the production of long-lasting consumer goods, business, defense and space equipment. 
The surge in manufacturing output combined with a 4.2% increase in utilities to offset a 2.9% slump in mining, leading to a 5.4% rise in industrial production in June. That followed a 1.4% gain in May. Oil and gas well drilling fell 18.0% and was about 70% below its year-earlier level. 
Industrial production contracted at a 42.6% rate in the second quarter, the largest decline since World War II, after decreasing at a 6.8% pace in the first quarter.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 4.6 percentage points to 66.9% in June. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector rose 3.5 percentage points to 68.6%. It is 11.2 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average. 
""There is little incentive to invest in capex as yet,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""This is likely to hold back the broader recovery and is a key factor why we doubt the U.S. economy will recover all of its lost output much before the end of 2022.""
Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
Inflation is likely to remain weak, though the risk of deflation has significantly diminished. A report from the Labor Department showed import prices accelerated 1.4% last month, the largest increase since March 2012, after rising 0.8% in May. In the 12 months through June, import prices fell 3.8% after dropping 6.2% in May. 

Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.

Investing.com – U.S. economic activity increased but remained to be well below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, a Federal Reserve survey showed.
The central bank’s economic report, based on anecdotal information collected by the Fed’s 12 reserve banks through July 6, flagged the coronavirus-led hit to the economy and signaled that the outlook continued to remain uncertain.  
""Outlooks remained highly uncertain, as contacts grappled with how long the COVID-19 pandemic would continue and the magnitude of its economic implications,"" the Fed's report showed.
Despite the sharp recovery in job hiring in recent months, the report highlighted that employees were reluctant to return to work amid safety concerns and generous unemployment benefits.
Employment increased in almost all districts, led by retail and leisure and hospitality sectors, but contacts in nearly every District ""noted difficulty in bringing back workers because of health and safety concerns, childcare needs, and generous unemployment insurance benefits.""
The pace of inflation, one of key driving forces that will determine the Fed's next policy move, remained roughly unchanged. ""Contacts across Districts largely reported both input and selling prices were flat .. though several Districts ""reported that supply chain challenges were pushing up prices for health and safety equipment used to limit the spread of Covid-19,"" according to the report.
Fed officials have continually warned that the economic outlook will remain uncertain even if the spread of coronavirus infections slows.
“The recent resurgence in Covid cases is a sober reminder that the pandemic remains the key driver of the economy’s course,” said Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday. ""A thick fog of uncertainty still surrounds us, and downside risks predominate,"""

ISM said the inaugural hospital PMI will be published on Aug. 7 at 10 a.m.(1400 GMT) featuring July data.
Hospitals are grappling with shortages of personal protective equipment as new coronavirus cases surge across the country. The ISM said in a statement that it hoped the new PMI would be a useful tool for the hospital sector as it restructures its supply chains.
""ISM is proud to expand the depth of our economic insights as we look to serve the supply management profession and the greater economic community,"" said ISM CEO Thomas Derry. ""Long planned, the hospital PMI promises to be a valuable tool to clinicians, administrators, and policy makers just as the fragility of medical supply chains has become a pivotal topic.""
Hospital-specific data has been collected since April 2018, and monthly reports will be released on the fifth business day of the month. Just as with the established ISM manufacturing and nonmanufacturing indexes, a reading above 50 indicates growth in the hospital sector. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.

279,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",German retailers set for worst downturn since World War Two,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German non-food retailers will see sales drop by around 22% this year if there is no second wave of coronavirus infections, putting the sector on track for its worst downturn since World War Two, the HDE association said on Wednesday.
Including food, retail sales will fall by 4% year-on-year, the HDE retail body said, highlighting the diverging fortunes of food stores - which stayed open during more than five weeks of lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus - and non-food retailers that temporarily closed.
The pandemic has drastically changed consumer habits as many, fearful of catching the virus, prefer to buy online rather than venture out to stores.
The HDE said that during March, April and May, expenditure per shopping trip at stationary retailers fell by 10% while it rose by 20% online.
This is especially problematic for small retailers who often lack the technology to sell online, it said.

""The coronavirus crisis will preoccupy the retail sector for years to come,"" said HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth. ""Many consumers have changed their shopping habits and retailers need to adapt.""

280,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Lockdown computer gaming helps fuel rise in UK inflation,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation rose unexpectedly last month, spurred by rising prices for in-demand computer consoles during the coronavirus lockdown, official data showed on Wednesday.
Consumer price inflation increased to 0.6% in June from May's four-year low of 0.5%, pushed up also by the lack of traditional summer clothing sales last month after retailers slashed prices during the lockdown earlier in the year.
The average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists was for the rate to fall to 0.4%. Only a few had predicted an increase.
""June's inflation figures are slightly above expectations but there remains abundant spare capacity in the economy,"" said Debapratim De, senior economist at Deloitte.
""This should maintain a downward pressure on inflation, which could fall further, especially if there is a spike in unemployment later this year.""
Data published on Tuesday showed gross domestic product grew by a slower than expected 1.8% in May from April, when it slumped by 20%. The government's budget forecasters said the economy could shrink by as a much as 14.3% this year. 
An emergency cut to the VAT sales tax rate for hospitality and tourism, which took effect on Wednesday, is also likely to exert downward pressure on inflation.
Economists say inflation running well below the Bank of England's 2% target leaves it under no pressure to rethink its huge stimulus push.
PRICES POWER UP
The coronavirus outbreak's impact on supply chains led to shortages of game consoles around the world, just as demand spiked from people isolating at home.
In May, the Japanese computer games giant Nintendo (T:7974) reported a surge in profits in the first three months of the year, when many countries first entered lockdown.
""It is possible that prices have been influenced by the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown changing the timing of demand and the availability of some items, particularly consoles,"" the ONS said in a statement.
""However, it is equally likely to be a result of the computer games in the bestseller charts.""
Clothing and footwear prices almost held steady in June, a month which usually sees sales promotions.
The ONS said 17% of the items used to compile the CPI were unavailable to consumers in June because of the lockdown, including pints of lager in pubs and haircuts.
Core inflation - which excludes typically volatile prices - rose to 1.4% from May's 1.2%.

Factories' selling prices fell 0.8% in annual terms, compared with the Reuters poll consensus for a 1.1% drop.

281,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",Australian consumers shaken as virus lockdowns return: survey,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian consumer sentiment showed a setback in July as renewed coronavirus lockdowns in the country's second-largest city darkened the mood after two months of gain.
The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment fell 6.1% in July from June, when it had bounced 6.3%. The index had taken a nosedive in April as lockdowns gripped the country, but jumped by a record in May as restrictions eased.
The July fall left the index down 8.9% on the same period last year at 87.9, meaning pessimists outnumbered optimists by some margin.
""Sentiment has been rocked by the resurgence in Coronavirus cases over the last month,"" said Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans. ""After averaging about 10 a day through late May and early June, new cases have lifted significantly, running at close to 200 a day in the July survey week.""
The spike forced the lockdown of much of Melbourne, the capital of the state of Victoria, and threatened to derail economic recovery.
Victoria's sentiment index alone dived 10.4% in July from June, though the rest of the nation excluding Victoria fell a more modest 4.5%.
Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and the Melbourne Institute surveyed 1,200 people from across the county.
The survey showed a sharp reversal on the economy with the index measuring the outlook for the economy over the next 12 months down 14%, and the index for the next five years easing 10.3%.
The measure of family finances compared to a year earlier stayed firm at 2.5%, but the outlook for the next 12 months slid 6.7%.
In a blow for hard-hit retailers, the measure of whether consumers felt it was a good time to buy a major household item dropped 2.1%.

There was better news on housing where the time to buy a new dwelling index bounced 4.1% in July, returning to its level in February before the pandemic took hold.

The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate slid to 4.3% in June, notches below a decade-high of 4.5% in May when it surged to the highest since January 2010, data from Statistics Korea showed on Wednesday.

Data also showed the number of employed was around 27.1 million in June, 352,000 fewer than a year earlier. This marked the fourth month of year-on-year decline, the longest losing streak in more than 10 years.

283,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers' mood pinned near 11-year lows as pandemic hammers global demand,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers remained close to the most pessimistic they have been in 11 years in July as the coronavirus outbreak hits global demand and deals a punishing blow to the export-reliant economy, the Reuters tankan survey showed on Wednesday.
But some firms, in particular those from the service sector, believed conditions would be less negative in the next few months, according to the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
Wednesday's survey found that sentiment at manufacturers was largely unchanged at minus 44 in July from minus 46 the previous month, which was its lowest reading since June 2009. The service-sector gauge ticked up to minus 26 from minus 32.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
""Demand is still weak, both overseas and domestically,"" a manager at a chemicals maker wrote in the survey.
All industry categories across manufacturing were pessimistic, underscoring the harsh conditions firms are facing as the health crisis slams the brakes on the world's third-largest economy.
The survey showed manufacturers' sentiment in October at minus 32 and that of service-sector firms at minus 16 as some respondents, such as a metals maker, saw a bottoming out in the auto sector, suggesting stronger demand ahead.
A manager at a retailer said: ""Though there are recovery signs, sales of new and used cars are still at a level of 70% to 80% from a year earlier.""
The BOJ is set to keep monetary settings steady later on Wednesday and provide a cautiously optimistic view on the economic outlook, signalling it has taken enough steps for now to offset the pandemic hit, sources told Reuters last week.
The central bank may slightly cut its growth forecast for the current year to March 2021, but is expected to hold on to its view Japan is headed for a moderate recovery later this year as the virus crisis subsides.
All industry categories across manufacturing were gloomy about business conditions, according to the poll of 496 large- and mid-sized non-financial companies, of which 238 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
""Production activity is still facing constraints,"" a manager at an electrical machinery maker wrote in the survey.

Among services, those from the information/communications and retailers sectors were optimistic about business conditions, while the others were not.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",Gasoline boosts U.S. inflation; escalating COVID-19 cases seen suppressing demand,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rebounded by the most in nearly eight years in June, but a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases after the reopening of businesses suggests a moderation in demand that could keep inflation muted and allow the Federal Reserve to keep injecting money into the ailing economy.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday came as some densely populated states in the South and West regions were dialing back or pausing reopenings, overwhelmed by rising infections of the respiratory illness. California on Monday announced new business restrictions. 
The economy slipped into recession in February. Economists are warning of a prolonged slump in the absence of a comprehensive national effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic, which is making consumers cautious about spending.
""The economic downturn is going to last longer with the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic spreading across the nation and this extended period of weak growth and soft demand will keep the inflation genie locked in her bottle for longer as well,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The consumer price index increased 0.6% last month, the biggest gain since August 2012, after easing 0.1% in May. The increase, which ended three straight months of declines, was driven by a 12.3% jump in gasoline prices after dropping in the first five months of the year. 
Food prices rose a solid 0.6%. The cost of food consumed at home increased 0.7%. Beef prices maintained their upward trend, advancing 4.8%. The cost of beef has shot up 20.4% over the last three months, reflecting shortages as a result of COVID-19 infections at meat processing plants. Consumers also paid more for nonalcoholic beverages, fruits and vegetables.
The index for food away from home rose 0.5%. Prices for full service meals surged a record 0.9%, likely reflecting higher operating costs for reopening restaurants. 
In the 12 months through June, the CPI climbed 0.6% after gaining 0.1% in May, which was the smallest year-on-year rise since September 2015. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI increasing 0.5% in June and advancing 0.6% year-on-year.
The Fed is pumping money into the economy through extraordinary measures, including large-scale asset purchases and funneling loans to firms. Separately, the government has provided nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus, contributing to a record monthly budget deficit in June. 
There have been fears that the unprecedented stimulus could stoke inflation. But with a record 33 million people on unemployment benefits, inflation is likely to remain benign. Gross domestic product is expected to have declined in the second quarter at its steepest pace since the Great Depression.
The country's largest banks warned on Tuesday that the worst for the economy was still to come after reporting sharp declines in profits in the second quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RENT INCREASES SLOW
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose 0.2% in June after slipping 0.1% in May. The so-called core CPI had dropped for three consecutive months for the first time since the series started in 1957. 
The rebound in underlying inflation suggests deflation is unlikely for now. Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices. 
""The Fed can be relieved that the immediate threat of deflation has passed, but it can hardly rest easy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Apparel prices jumped 1.7%, the most since February 1990. Airline fares accelerated 2.6%, the largest gain since May 2015. Consumers also paid more for healthcare, household furnishings, tobacco and hotel and motel accommodation.
But owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home gained 0.1%, the smallest rise since July 2013. That likely reflects forbearance agreements between landlords and tenants who have lost their jobs or have had their hours cut because of the pandemic. This rent measure rose 0.3% in May.
In the 12 months through June, the core CPI increased 1.2%, matching May's gain.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since December 2010. June's core PCE price index data will be released at the end of this month.

""With an increasing number of Fed officials expressing concern over a loss of economic momentum as states reintroduce COVID-19 containment measures, they will continue to do what is necessary to keep credit flowing and interest rates pinned to the floor,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.

285,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Brazil's economy swings back to modest growth in May,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil began to grow again in monthly terms in May, after two sharp consecutive declines in March and April, as businesses slowly began to open up in the wake of coronavirus-related quarantining measures.
The central bank's IBC-Br index, a leading indicator of gross domestic product, rose 1.31% in May from April. That was a marked improvement from the 9.7% slump in April.
Still, the modest rise is far from proof that Brazil's economy is out of the woods. Economic activity was off some 14.24% from the same period last year, the bank said.
""The growth in real economic activity in May is due to the gradual relaxation of social distancing and measures to restrict activity and movement,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Bernal.
""Although the pandemic still needs to be controlled, recent data and some metrics suggest activity hit bottom and reached an inflection point sometime in the middle of April.""

286,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","How to read U.S. economic data, without the spin","By Ann Saphir
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As the United States gears up for presidential, congressional and local elections in November, the country's economy is also on a rollercoaster ride.
Attempts to stop the spread of the coronavirus in March put tens of millions out of work, pinched spending and slowed factory output.
As many states began relaxing their lockdowns in May, some of that data went into reverse: jobs started coming back, factories made more stuff, and households bought it up. With some states now shutting businesses again and shoppers and diners worried amid a recent resurgence of infections, those gains could reverse. 
Amid the upheaval, politicians and analysts of all stripes are seizing on figures (https://twitter.com/WhiteHouseCEA/status/1268935885887848448?s=20) that support (https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1273670561864929280?s=20) their particular (https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/16/vice-president-mike-pence-lands-iowa-third-visit-tight-presidential-race/3193676001) narrative (https://twitter.com/sendavidperdue/status/1268897161141460998?s=20), while ignoring (https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1268972501373247489?s=20) others that don't. 
Early this month, President Donald Trump said June's record jobs gain ""proves that our economy is roaring back."" 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on the other hand, said that the unemployment figures show that Congress needs to pass a new coronavirus relief bill that gives people cash, or the ""economy will only worsen."" 
Who is right? Here are some guidelines to judge the health of the U.S. economy for yourself in the months to come. 
IT'S A RECORD, YOU SAY? 
A record 4.8 million jobs were created (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy/u-s-job-growth-roars-back-but-covid-19-resurgence-threatens-recovery-idUSKBN2430FF) in June, the Labor Department's latest monthly jobs report showed. That's on top of the reported 2.7 million jobs created in May. 
It sounds pretty good. But coming after the COVID-19 related shutdowns, the increase in May and June is a bit like falling down a 22-foot hole - and then clambering up a seven-and-a-half-foot ladder at the bottom. 
In this case, there were 152.5 million employed U.S. workers in February before the coronavirus hit - that number is now 137.8 million, even after two months of increases.
So be careful of 'records.' The numbers have been big in both directions, and probably will be for a while. Instead, take a look at how the current situation compares to the relatively healthy pre-COVID economy:
(GRAPHIC - End of a historic jobs boom: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvyzygxpg/Pasted%20image%201594654257270.png)
HOW MANY ARE UNEMPLOYED?
Weekly first-time claims (https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) for unemployment insurance, or the number of new people filing for unemployment benefits, have also been falling in recent weeks. After hitting a high of 6.867 million in late March, they came in at 1.314 million for the week ended July 4. 
Still, claims are twice as high as they were at the height of the Great Recession, and more than six times the 2019 average of just over 200,000. See https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IC4WSA for a historical comparison.
Just as important is how many people remain on jobless benefits from week to week. These continued unemployment claims, charted https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCSA, were 18 million in the week ended June 27.
(GRAPHIC - Over 18 million Americans are on unemployment: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgoegepq/Pasted%20image%201594653982675.png)
NO, REALLY, HOW MANY ARE UNEMPLOYED?
The continued unemployment claims data above doesn't show the whole picture, however.
A brand new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program gives unemployment benefits to contract workers like ride-share drivers. Such workers wouldn't normally qualify for aid while between gigs, but were made eligible because of the enormity of the economic disruption. 
Adding in the nearly 15 million people receiving these and other special benefits, a staggering 32.9 million U.S. residents were getting some type of unemployment assistances as of June 20, the most recent date for which this data is reported. (https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf)
Meanwhile, the official unemployment rate (https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) fell in June to 11.1%, from 13.3% in May. While clearly an improvement, it still exceeds the worst reading during the Great Recession of 10%. 
The government says it's almost certainly an undercount (https://www.bls.gov/cps/employment-situation-covid19-faq-june-2020.pdf): if job status were classified correctly, unemployment in June would have been closer to 12.3%, down from 16.4% in May. This undercount is likely to shrink as time goes on. 
IT'S HARD TO GET ADJUSTED
Another thing to keep in mind is that some data is adjusted for seasonal factors, like holidays and seasonal weather patterns, and some isn't. Sometimes when the data doesn't add up, that is the reason. 
Then there is annualized data.
Every three months the U.S. government publishes an initial estimate of how fast the economy is growing - or, as in the current crisis, shrinking - compared with the previous three months. 
Because the public health response to the coronavirus was to stop much of daily commerce, GDP in the April to June quarter is expected (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLENI) to shrink more than 30% (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPNOW) on an annualized basis, far outpacing the previous record, a 10% drop in the first quarter of 1958. 
This is clearly a sign the economy is distressed - but it does not mean the United States' gross domestic product (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPC1), which was $21.4 trillion in 2019, has shrunk to a third of its former size. Instead it is on course to shrink that much if it continues to contract at the same pace for a full year. 
That's unlikely. Instead, most economists forecast record third-quarter GDP growth of 20% or more. The first estimate of second-quarter growth is due out on July 30; the initial third- quarter report is due out on Oct. 29, just days before the election. 

Even so the economy will likely end 2020 smaller than it began, perhaps by about 6.5%, according to Federal Reserve policymaker estimates. (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20200610.pdf)

287,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",Pandemic knocks Singapore into recession as GDP plummets 41% in second quarter,"By Aradhana Aravindan and John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's trade-reliant economy plunged into recession in the second quarter with a record contraction, signaling a rough first half globally and an equally challenging outlook as the coronavirus crisis exacts a heavy toll on business and demand. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) dived by a record 41.2% in the three months ended March, on a quarter-on-quarter annualised basis, preliminary data from the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed on Tuesday. 
That was worse than economists' expectations for a 37.4% decline in the quarter when Singapore was under a lockdown to curb the spread of the virus.
The first in Asia to report second-quarter GDP data, the grim numbers for the wealthy city-state - a bellwether for the global economy - underscore the sweeping worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and point to an arduous road ahead. Many major economies are already facing their steepest downturn in decades.
""If you want to read something into this, it is what is going to happen to economies that have taken a similar sort of lockdown,"" said Rob Carnell, chief economist, Asia-Pacific at ING Bank.
In June, the International Monetary Fund warned of a steep contraction in global economic activity as the health crisis shut businesses, depressed consumption and paralysed trade. It forecast 2020 world output to shrink by 4.9%, compared with a 3.0% contraction predicted in April.
The once-in-a-century pandemic has so far infected over 13 million people worldwide and killed more than 571,000. Singapore has reported 46,283 coronavirus cases with 26 deaths as of Monday.
""There is an element of global weakness in there as well, obviously the trade side is very important for Singapore and that has been absolutely clobbered,"" Carnell said.
The sectoral impact was broadbased with the services and construction sector hardest hit. 
Construction plummeted 95.6% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, grinding to a near halt as the city-state quarantined tens of thousands of migrant labourers in dormitories ravaged by the virus. 
""We were expecting these numbers to look quite dismal, although this is worse than what we had expected,"" said Steve Cochrane, economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. 
On a year-on year basis, GDP dived 12.6% versus economists forecast for a 10.5% contraction. 
The manufacturing sector grew 2.5% from a year ago, mainly due to a surge in output in biomedical sector, though that was still lower than the 8.2% rise in the first quarter.
The GDP slump marked the second consecutive quarter of contractions for the global finance hub - having declined a revised 0.3% year-on-year in the first quarter and 3.3% quarter-on-quarter - meeting the definition for a technical recession.
WORST-EVER SLUMP
The Singapore dollar was down 0.2% on the day versus the U.S. dollar.
The government expects full-year GDP to contract in the range of -7% to -4%, the biggest downturn in its history. Citi analysts see a 8.5% contraction and expect another downgrade to official forecasts next month when final GDP data is released.
The central bank eased its monetary policy in March and has introduced measures to boost bank lending, while the government has pumped in nearly S$100 billion ($72 billion) worth of stimulus to blunt the impact of the pandemic.
The People's Action Party, which extended its unbroken rule in last week's election, has said protecting Singaporean jobs is its biggest priority. 
Analysts expect the economy to start improving as more business and services reopen, but warned of a bumpy road ahead. 
""We expect growth to rebound in H2 supported by a massive fiscal response,"" said Oxford Economics' Sung Eun Jung. 

""But if global demand suffers another blow from a re-imposition of lockdowns...we are likely to see a more 'W-shaped' recovery.""

Manufacturing output in the region rose by 12.4% in May from April, mostly driven by a surge in production of durable consumer goods, such as cars or fridges, the European Union statistics office Eurostat said.
But the increase was significantly lower than the 15% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters.
It was also much less pronounced than the 18.2% decline in April, which had followed a 11.8% drop in March, as factories were forced to shut or reduce activity at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe.
The limited rebound in May, when many plants reopened, suggest the recovery is limited. The fall in April was also bigger than initially estimated by Eurostat, which on Tuesday revised its month-on-month data to -18.2% from -17.1%.
Compared with a year earlier, industrial production was down by 20.9%, worse than market expectations of 20.0% but better Aprils 28.7% drop.
The rebound from April concerned all economic sectors surveyed by Eurostat. It was mainly driven by a 54.2% leap in the production of durable consumer goods, which nearly offset big falls in the previous two months.
Factories also increased by 25.4% their output of capital goods, such as machinery, in a sign of confidence in long-term economic growth. The increase was, however, lower than the 26.1% fall in April.
Among the largest euro zone states, Italy's recovery was the most impressive, with plants ramping up production in May by 42.1% compared with April, after the country suffered the bloc's worst fall in activity in the two previous months combined.

Germany's industrial production went up by 9.7% on the month, and in France output rose by 20.0%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports in June rose for the first time since the coronavirus crisis paralysed the economy, as government stimulus stoked demand for commodities, while exports, fuelled by medical goods, also rose in a sign the recovery is gaining traction. 
Beijing has doled out aggressive stimulus to support domestic demand even as a resurgence in coronavirus infections around the world has raised questions about the strength of a rebound in global economic activity. 
China's imports in June rose 2.7% from a year earlier, customs data showed on Tuesday, confounding market expectations for a 10% drop. They had fallen 16.7% the previous month. 
Exports also rose unexpectedly, up 0.5%, suggesting global demand is starting to pick up again as many countries begin to ease tough anti-virus measures that have pushed the world's economy into its biggest slump in almost 90 years. Analyst had estimated a 1.5% drop following a 3.3% decline in May. 
""The significant improvement in China's imports is an indication of the country's accelerating economic recovery, which has been mainly driven by substantial increases in investments in sectors such as real estate and infrastructure,"" said Boyang Xue, a China analyst at consultancy firm DuckerFrontier. 
Indeed, iron ore imports jumped to the highest in 33 months in June, the trade data showed, fuelled by rising shipments from miners and robust demand. Crude oil imports also hit an all-time high amid bargain hunting by Chinese refiners as oil prices collapsed.
Martin Rasmussen, China economist at Capital Economics, expects China's imports will continue to improve as a ramp-up in fiscal stimulus boosts domestic demand. 
China's imports from the United States rose 11.3% in June, reversing a double digit declining trend seen after the coronavirus outbreak. 
""Faced with difficulties presented by the sudden epidemic, we're still honouring our commitments and implementing the (trade) agreement,"" customs spokesman Liu Kuiwen told reporters on Tuesday. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he was not thinking about negotiating a ""Phase 2"" trade deal with China as relations between Washington and Beijing have been ""severely damaged"" due to the coronavirus pandemic and other issues.
China's trade surplus with the United States widened to $29.41 billion in June from $27.89 billion in May. 
EXPORTS RISE 
China's economy is recovering from a sharp 6.8% contraction in the first quarter, but the recovery remains fragile as global demand falters due to social restrictions and still rising coronavirus cases. Chinese consumption is also subdued amid job losses and concerns about a second wave of infections.
The country's export performance however has not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared, supported by shipments of face masks, personal protective equipment and computers. 
""The reopening of major western economies and elevated overseas demand for PPEs and masks supported Chinese exports in June,"" said Xue from DuckerFrontier. ""In addition, production disruptions in China's trade competitors also helped to shift some orders to Chinese exporters.""
Despite the partial reopening of Western economies in the past few weeks, some countries are reimposing various lockdown measures to battle a resurgence in coronavirus cases.
""Looking ahead, the boost from shipments of masks, medical products and work-from-home equipment, which are still growing at over 30% y/y, will continue to fade and weigh on exports,"" said Rasmussen from Capital Economics, adding that exports would start to contract again before long.
Worsening U.S.-China relations, shrinking global demand and disruptions in supply chains are also likely to pressure the trade outlook over the long run, Institute of Advanced Research at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics said in a report on Saturday. 

The country's trade surplus for June stood at $46.42 billion, compared with a surplus of $62.93 billion in May.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy stumbled out of its coronavirus-induced slump in May, casting doubt on the chances of a rapid rebound and suggesting more government help to kickstart recovery may be on its way.
Gross domestic product rose 1.8% after lockdown restrictions were eased slightly, the Office for National Statistics said - a smaller rebound than any economist had forecast in a Reuters poll and following a record 20.3% contraction in April when curbs were tightest.
With activity in the services sector having failed to pick up as expected, Tuesday's figures are likely to fuel doubts about whether Britain will enjoy a quick, 'V'-shaped bounceback as lockdown curbs are lifted further.
""Today's figures underline the scale of the challenge we face. I know people are worried about the security of their jobs and incomes,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Last week Sunak announced an extra 30 billion pounds ($38 billion) of stimulus to limit the increase in unemployment.
But temporary government support for more than 9 million jobs will be phased out between August and October, and the Bank of England has warned of the risk of a big rise in jobless numbers.
More than 44,000 people in Britain have died from COVID-19, the highest death toll in Europe, and a second wave of infections could bring a new round of lockdowns, derailing recovery.
""More significant fiscal stimulus is likely to be needed to help kickstart a sustained recovery,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.
The pick-up in output in May was probably down to ""the partial release of pent-up demand as restrictions began to loosen, rather than evidence of a genuine recovery,"" he said.
BEARISH IMF 
Britain's government first closed non-essential shops and other businesses to the public on March 23, shortly after ordering the closure of bars, restaurants and cinemas. 
Over March and April economic output slumped by a record 25.9%, slightly more than previously thought, and output in May was 24.0% below its level a year earlier.
The International Monetary Fund forecast last month that Britain's economy would shrink by more than 10% this year, a historic decline though a smaller one than it predicted for France or Italy.
""Hopes of a 'V'-shaped recovery are fading fast, and I suspect we're looking at something resembling far more of a 'W' - a series of improvements and relapses, before a proper recovery takes hold,"" said Tom Stevenson, an investment director at fund manager Fidelity International.
May's limited rebound was driven by just 0.9% growth in Britain's large services sector - well below economists' forecasts - with weakness in professional services, arts and entertainment, commercial property and computer programming.
The wholesale and retail sector made the biggest contribution to growth in May after being the largest drag in April. 
Industrial output and construction also recovered strongly, in line with forecasts, after a very large hit in April. 
May's figures offer only a limited guide to how the economy will ultimately recover, as more significant relaxations to lockdown restrictions for shops and restaurants in England only started in June and July. 
Private sector data has shown some signs of recovery in May and June, as lockdown measures eased further.
The British Retail Consortium said earlier on Tuesday that spending in June was up 3.4% on a year ago.

Investing.com – China reported positive customs data on Tuesday, an encouraging sign that the world’s second largest economy is recovering from the COVID-19 virus.
Exports rose 0.5% year-on-year in June, higher than analyst expectations of a 1.5% drop and last month’s 3.3% drop. Imports rose 2.7% year-on-year during the same month, also beating expectations of a 10% drop and a 16.7% slide in May.
Chinese exports and imports benefitted from some countries loosening lockdown measures, and the resultant uptick in economic activity. But trade volumes for the first half of the year remain well below previous years’ levels and fresh outbreaks of the virus prompted the re-implementation of lockdown measures in cities such as Melbourne and Hong Kong,
Meanwhile, the trade balance decreased to $46.42 billion, much smaller than the forecasted $58.60 billion and May’s $62.93 billion. Simmering U.S.-China tensions over trade and Hong Kong’s national security law enacted on July 1 led to a wider trade surplus with the U.S.
An increase in the trade balance “could be the major support for the second quarter’s GDP growth, but it could only help to a certain extent,” Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at ING Bank NV, told Bloomberg ahead of the data’s release.

Gross domestic product declined an annualized 41.2% from the previous three months, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said in a statement Tuesday, the biggest quarterly contraction on record and worse than the Bloomberg survey median of a 35.9% drop. Compared with a year earlier, GDP fell 12.6% in the second quarter, versus a survey median of -10.5%.
The deepening slump reflects the knock Singapore’s economy is taking from all sides amid the pandemic. A plunge in global trade has hit the export-reliant manufacturing industry, while retailers have seen a record decline in sales.
It also puts added pressure on the ruling People’s Action Party, which had its weakest performance ever in last week’s election. The government has already pledged about S$93 billion ($67 billion) in stimulus to shore up troubled businesses and households and to prevent a surge in retrenchments.
The record slump last quarter was mainly due to a partial lockdown, known as “circuit breaker” measures in Singapore, implemented from April 7 to June 1 to slow the spread of Covid-19, the MTI said.
Singapore’s relatively early GDP release provides a window on how deep a recession other Asian economies are likely to face. Thailand’s official forecast of an 8.1% contraction this year is the worst in the region, while others like India and Indonesia are facing a surge in virus cases that’s exacerbating economic woes.
Factory purchasing managers indexes show that manufacturing across Asia started to pick up at the end of the second quarter, with many governments allowing early phases of re-opening that are rejuvenating demand.

The British Retail Consortium trade body said retail sales values rose by 3.4% in annual terms in June, the biggest increase since May 2018, although the reading was flattered by the comparison with unusually weak sales in June 2019.
The turnaround is especially sharp when compared with a 19.1% fall in spending recorded in April, when lockdown restrictions were greatest.
Food, computing and furniture sales were bright spots last month but although clothing and health and beauty sales remained weak.
Separately, payment card company Barclaycard said overall consumer spending fell 14.5% in annual terms in June - the smallest decline since lockdown began.
The surveys added to tentative signs of an economic recovery, although many economists are cautious about its longevity beyond the rebound caused by household spending on goods and services that had been postponed during lockdown.
""Though a month of growth is welcome news, retail is not out of the woods yet. The pandemic continues to pose huge challenges to the industry, with ongoing stores closures and job losses across the UK,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.
She added that the reopening of pubs and restaurants, which took place earlier this month, could further help high street retail sales.
Barclaycard said spending on food and drink outside the home was down by 56% year-on-year in June, before the lockdown eased - though this represented an improvement on the 70% fall in May, as more food was bought to takeaway or for delivery.

The June deficit brought the year-to-date fiscal deficit to $2.7 trillion, far eclipsing the previous full-year record of $1.4 trillion in 2009. 
Some analysts forecast a gap as high as $3.8 trillion for the fiscal year to Sept. 30.
Outlays were up 223% to $1.1 trillion, a record increase for any month. The bulk of the June's jump in outlays was $511 billion for the government's Paycheck Protection Program, set up in April and designed to keep small businesses afloat by funding loans that are forgivable if certain criteria are met.
A senior Treasury official told reporters that under U.S. government accounting rules, the funds were recorded as spent in June even though Treasury has not yet paid out for forgiveness of those loans and not all may be forgiven.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers are more optimistic that the worst of the economic crisis sparked by the coronavirus pandemic is behind them, but are still concerned about their earnings and their ability to find new jobs if they become unemployed, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Workers became less concerned about becoming jobless, with consumers saying there was an average 15% chance that they would lose their jobs in the next year. That is the lowest since February, when consumers registered a 13.8% chance of losing their jobs over the next 12 months. 
Consumers also expressed more confidence in their ability to pay their bills. The probability of missing a debt payment in the next three months dropped to an average 9.8% in June, the lowest since the survey launched in 2013 and down substantially from 16.2% in April.
The shift mirrors one in the labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate surged to 14.7% in April as businesses shut down to limit the spread of the virus. As some businesses hired workers back, the jobless rate declined to 11.1% in June. However, more than 32.9 million people collected unemployment checks in the third week of June, suggesting the labor market is years away from a full recovery. 
Despite the tepid optimism, workers lowered their expectations for finding new work and for future earnings.
The median expectations for how earnings would grow over the next year dropped to 1.6% in June from 2.0% in May, hitting a series low. Workers earning less than $50,000 a year, and those without college degrees, expected the weakest earnings growth. (Graphic: Expected earnings growth over the next year, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmglggvr/Pasted%20image%201594657390397.png)

June exports from the world's second-largest economy are expected to have contracted 1.5% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate from the survey of 32 economists, easing from a decline of 3.3% in May.
Imports likely fell 10.0% on year, the poll showed, compared with a steep drop of 16.7% the previous month, due to higher purchases of crude oil and orders for infrastructure materials.
Official and private factory surveys for June have shown the manufacturing sector recovery gathering more momentum.
Factories have ramped up production on an expansion in new orders, fuelling expectations of an economic rebound faster than analysts previously forecasted. Factory-gate prices, for example, turned positive on a monthly basis last month.
Since mid-May, European countries and the United States have gradually eased their lockdowns, leading to increased shipments of some cargo backlogs previously stuck at Chinese ports and driving a relatively fast rebound in port throughput, said China Ports & Harbours Association in June.
In the last 10 days of June, container throughput at major Chinese ports rose 4.3% from the same period a year earlier, latest data from the association showed.
Moreover, the recurrent waves of coronavirus cases in major economies overseas, especially in the United States since mid-June, may have continued to support China's exports of personal protective equipment (PPE) in June, analysts at Nomura said in a note.
China's export performance has not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared, but weak overseas orders are set to weigh on its manufacturers in the coming quarters. 
Chinese officials have repeatedly vowed to stabilize foreign trade, a sector that provides about 200 million urban jobs, and help as many firms to survive the downturn. One of the ways they have advocated is for manufacturers to sell to domestic markets but a lack of sales channels and price-cutting have hindered their efforts. The domestic recovery is also being restrained worries about a second wave of infections. 

The coronavirus pandemic is causing wider and deeper damage to economic activity than first thought, the International Monetary Fund said in June, prompting the institution to slash its 2020 global output forecasts to -4.9% from a contraction of 3.0% predicted in April.

302,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2020 10:27PM ET</span>","Australia’s Effective Unemployment Rate 13.3%, Frydenberg Says","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s effective unemployment rate that also includes people who have opted against searching for work as the economy contracts is almost double the official jobless level, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.
“That is around 13.3% right now,” Frydenberg said of the effective rate, in contrast to the official unemployment rate of 7.1%, in Melbourne Thursday. “That is a large number of people reflecting the economic challenges that we see right now.”
Australia’s economy tumbled into recession in the first half of the year -- ending an almost three-decade expansion -- and Treasury, the department that provides economic analysis and develops policy for Frydenberg, reckons official unemployment will climb to 8% this quarter.
“We have seen a big reduction in hours worked in the months since the Covid pandemic first hit in Australia. Globally, they are seeing the same,” the treasurer said. “That just reflects the enormous economic challenge that we face and the impact it’s having on the unemployment rate.”
The official unemployment rate has been held down by people giving up looking for employment -- captured with sharp fall in the participation rate -- and by the government’s JobKeeper program that pays a wage subsidy to keep workers tied to employers.
The jobless rate probably edged up to 7.2% in June as those previously discouraged from job searching return, offsetting the 100,000 positions added in the month, economists predicted ahead of Thursday’s employment data. The expected surge in hiring reflects the removal of restrictions and reopening of the economy during the month.
The southern state of Victoria, the second largest contributor to gross domestic product, has since had to reimpose lockdown orders as a second wave of Covid-19 sweeps the state capital, Melbourne.
Frydenberg is due to deliver a fiscal and economic statement on July 23 that will outline the government’s plans for ongoing stimulus as programs like JobKeeper and JobSeeker, a temporarily higher welfare payment for the unemployed, are due to expire in September.
There will be a “second phase of income support. It will be governed by the same principles that have defined our economic measures to date, namely that our support will be targeted, it will be temporary, it will be designed based on existing systems and it will also be demand driven,” Frydenberg said.
“So it is fair to say in Victoria, with the lockdown, which is going to be harsh on businesses and households, that our announcements on the 23rd will take into account the Victorian circumstances,” he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in June as rising costs for energy goods were offset by weakness in services, pointing to subdued inflation that should allow the Federal Reserve to keep pumping money into the economy to arrest a downward spiral.
Still, deflation remains unlikely as the economy battles depressed demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The report from the Labor Department on Friday also showed underlying producer inflation ticked up last month. 
Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices. The economy slipped into recession in February. The Fed is injecting money into the economy through extraordinary measures while the government has provided nearly $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus.
""The message for Fed officials, if they needed convincing at all, is that the worst economy since the Great Depression is keeping inflationary pressures on the back burner for now and that interest rates will need to remain at very low levels for the next few years at a minimum,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The producer price index for final demand dropped 0.2% last month after rebounding 0.4% in May. In the 12 months through June, the PPI declined 0.8%, matching May's decrease. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would climb 0.4% in June and fall 0.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.3% in June. That was the biggest gain in the so-called core PPI since January and followed a 0.1% rise in May. In the 12 months through June, the core PPI edged down 0.1%. The core PPI dropped 0.4% on a year-on-year basis in May, which was the largest annual decrease since the introduction of the series in August 2013. 
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis in May, the smallest advance since December 2010. June's core PCE price index data will be released at the end of this month.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS
With a record 33 million people on unemployment benefits, inflation is likely to remain soft. Though businesses have reopened after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19, new cases of the respiratory illness have surged in large parts of the country, causing uncertainty and curtailing domestic demand. Overseas demand has also tanked.
Gross domestic product is expected to have declined in the second quarter at its steepest pace since the Great Depression.
""COVID caused global demand to collapse, which is ultimately deflationary, but it also caused all kinds of supply disruptions, which are momentarily inflationary,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The result is generally falling prices amidst a great deal more price volatility than has become the norm in the past decade. Both were on display in this morning's PPI"". 
In June, wholesale food prices decreased 5.2% after surging 6.0% in May. Wholesale energy prices shot up 7.7% in June after rebounding 4.5% in the prior month. Gasoline prices rose 26.3% after accelerating 43.9% in May. Goods prices gained 0.2% last month after jumping 1.6% in May. 
Excluding food and energy, goods prices inched up 0.1% last month after being unchanged in May.
The cost of services dropped 0.3% in June after falling 0.2% in the prior month. Services were weighed down by a 1.8% plunge in margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. 
A 7.3% drop in margins for machinery and vehicle wholesaling accounted for 80% of the decline in services last month. There were also decreases in the prices for apparel, jewelry, footwear and accessories. 

But prices for hospital inpatient care jumped 0.8% after rising 0.4% in May. The cost of healthcare services gained 0.2%after increasing 0.5% in May. Portfolio management fees advanced 2.2%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - New bank lending in China rose 22.3% in June as authorities continued to boost credit and ease policy to get the world's second-largest economy humming again after a sharp coronavirus-induced contraction.
Chinese banks extended 1.81 trillion yuan (204 billion pounds)in new yuan loans in June, up from 1.48 trillion yuan in May and slightly exceeding analysts' expectations, according to data released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Friday.
That pushed bank lending in the first half of this year to a record 12.09 trillion yuan ($1.72 trillion), beating a previous peak of 9.67 trillion yuan in the first half of 2019 and roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product (GDP) of Canada.
PBOC Governor Yi Gang said last month new loans could reach nearly 20 trillion yuan for the full year.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted 1.80 trillion yuan of new yuan loans in June.
The monthly tally was 9% higher than a year earlier. While lending in China typically picks up in June, analysts say policymakers want to maintain strong credit growth until the economy gets back on solid footing following a record 6.8% contraction in the first quarter.
Low interest rates, increased lending and a ramp-up in government bond issuance ""should help keep the economic recovery on track and allow output to return to its pre-virus trend by the end of the year,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note after the data.
""We anticipate a further acceleration (in credit growth) in the coming months.""
An increase in government bond issuance could help boost total social financing (TSF), a broader measure of credit and liquidity.
By the end of June, growth of outstanding TSF quickened to 12.8% year-on-year from May's 12.5%. TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In June, TSF rose to 3.43 trillion yuan from 3.19 trillion yuan in May. Analysts had expected 3.00 trillion yuan.
Yi also said China would keep financial system liquidity ample in the second half but would need to consider withdrawing support at some point, raising questions among investors over when it may start dialing down stimulus.
The PBOC has rolled out a raft of easing steps since early February, including cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements and extending targeted lending support for virus-hit firms. But it has not slashed interest rates to near zero or embarked on huge bond buying sprees as many other central banks have.
CREDIT-BACKED RECOVERY
China's policy steps to support the economy have yielded results and it will step up financial support for firms and employment in the second half, Ruan Jianhong, head of the central bank's statistics department, told a briefing.
China should allow phased rises in its macro leverage ratio to expand credit support for the economy, Ruan said, adding the debt level rose 14.5 percentage points in the first quarter and climbed further in the second quarter.
Guo Kai, vice head of the PBOC's monetary policy department, told the same briefing that credit growth should not outpace economic recovery and arbitrage and resource mismatch may occur if interest rates are too low.
On Friday,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) became the latest investment bank to upgrade its growth forecast for China, saying it now expected the economy to expand 2.2% in the second quarter from a year earlier, up from earlier expectations of 1.5%.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 978.8 billion yuan in June from 704.3 billion in May, while corporate loans rose to 927.8 billion yuan from 845.9 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on the central bank data.
Broad M2 money supply in June grew 11.1% from a year earlier, the data showed, in line with analysts' forecasts in a Reuters poll and the same pace as in May.

Outstanding yuan loans grew 13.2% from a year earlier, also steady from May, as expected.

Modest policy stimulus coupled with progress in battling the virus at home has led to an increasingly solid recovery in the world’s second largest economy, with output data for the second quarter due next week set to show a return to growth in the three months to June. At the same time, China remains vulnerable to renewed virus outbreaks, as well as the weakness of global demand for its export goods.
Broad M2 money supply grew 11.1% from a year earlier. The stock of outstanding credit rose 12.8% in the month, the fastest pace since February 2018.
The PBOC has slowed down the pace of monetary easing since late May amid the increasing signs of economic recovery, focusing instead on pushing banks to lend more to businesses. Governor Yi Gang pledged faster credit growth this year in a speech in June, saying the flow of total social financing should rise to at least 30 trillion yuan in 2020, which implies a 17% expansion from the level at the end of 2019.
In shadow banking, undiscounted bankers’ acceptances, mainly a means for funding small firms, jumped 218.9 billion yuan in the month, according to Bloomberg calculations.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Auto sales in China rose 11.6% in June from a year earlier to 2.3 million units, driven largely by strong demand for trucks and other commercial vehicles as Beijing ramps up infrastructure spending to revive the economy.
In a further sign the world's largest auto market is recovering from coronavirus lockdowns, auto wholesales in June rose for the third straight month to 2.3 million units, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), the country's largest auto industry body.
Sales of trucks, vans and other commercial vehicles, which constitute for around a quarter of overall market, surged 63% on-year, while sales of passenger vehicles rose only 1.8%. 
""The sales of trucks were driven by investment, and they were strong in past months, which was a precursor to the recovery of economic activity,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. 
Overall auto sales growth also was helped by supportive local government, said CAAM official Chen Shihua. 
""After local consumption promotion policies expire, market demand may also decline."" 
June's jump in overall sales follows a rise of 14.5% in May and 4.4% in April, before which sales had languished in a nearly two-year slump. Sales of commercial vehicles jumped 48% in May and 32% in April.
Automakers such as Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175), Great Wall Motor (SS:601633), Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported sales growth in China in June.
However, sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) fell for the twelfth straight month, to 104,000 units. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.

Despite recent signs of improvement, China's auto sales are expected to fall by 10%-20% for the year as a whole due to their earlier collapse, from over 25 million units sold in 2019, CAAM said last month.

307,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>","Japan's wholesale price fall eases in June, weak demand clouds outlook","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wholesale prices fell in June at a slower pace after sinking at the fastest rate in four years in May, as a rebound in Chinese demand lifted commodity costs and eased some of the deflationary pressure caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
But wholesale prices fell for an increasing number of goods dependent on domestic demand, such as construction materials and food products, suggesting the damage to Japan's economy from the health crisis is broadening.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, fell 1.6% in June from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Friday.
The drop was smaller than a median market forecast for a 1.9% fall and less than the 2.8% plunge in May, which was the biggest drop since October 2016.
The drop in oil and nonferrous metal prices eased in June, reflecting a pick-up in demand as China and many advanced economies lifted lockdowns, the data showed.
But the number of CGPI components that saw prices fall exceeded those that experienced price gains by 124 in June, up from 92 in May, reflecting sluggish domestic demand.
""The data shows that weakness in domestic demand caused by the pandemic is weighing on prices,"" Ichiro Muto, head of the BOJ's price statistics division, told reporters.
""Economic activity hasn't normalised completely, so it won't be surprising if weak demand keeps pressure on wholesale prices for some time,"" he said.
Japan's economy slipped into recession and is set to suffer a more than 20% annualised contraction in April-June, after the government in April urged citizens to stay home and businesses to close.

Although the state of emergency was lifted in late May, analysts expect the economy to recover only moderately in the face of the pandemic's sweeping global impact.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Weekly jobless claims near four-month low; millions drawing unemployment benefits,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits dropped to a near four-month low last week, but a record 32.9 million people were collecting unemployment checks in the third week of June, supporting expectations the labor market would take years to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Economists cautioned against reading too much into the bigger-than-expected decline in jobless claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday, noting that the period included the July 4 Independence Day. Claims data are volatile around holidays. 
Large parts of the country, including the densely populated states like Florida, Texas and California are struggling with record spikes of new coronavirus cases, which have forced authorities to scale back or pause reopenings of businesses, and sending some workers home again. Bankruptcies are rising amid weak demand and businesses have exhausted government loans which had enabled them to keep workers on their payrolls. 
""Don't be fooled, the economy's troubles aren't over yet, not by a long shot,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""For the labor market it is not the second wave that is holding jobs in suspension, it is the fears of the second wave and even a third wave that is holding the economy back and making the road to recovery an even longer one.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 99,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.314 million for the week ended July 4. The 14th straight weekly decline pushed claims to their lowest level since mid-March when nonessential businesses were closed to slow the spread of the respiratory illness.
Claims peaked at a historic 6.867 million in late March. They remain roughly double their highest point during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.375 million applications in the latest week. 
Including a program funded by the government, 2.4 million people filed claims last week. There were big declines in unemployment insurance applications in Georgia, California and Florida, despite the resurgence in coronavirus infections. Texas, however, reported a surge in filings.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
RISING UNCERTAINTY
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dipped 698,000 to 18.062 million in the week ending June 27. These so-called continued claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, topped out at a record 24.912 million in early May. 
Economists attribute the decrease in continuing claims to the government's Paycheck Protection Program, which provides businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for wages. The rehiring of workers at establishments like restaurants, bars, gyms and dental offices is also helping.
The government reported last week that 4.8 million jobs were created in June, the most since record-keeping started in 1939. 
But the boost from the PPP program is fading, even though the government has extended the deadline to Aug. 8 for small businesses to apply for loans. A survey from the NFIB last week showed some small business owners were cutting payrolls, noting ""many owners received their loans in April and will be unable to keep all their workers past June."" 
The economy slipped into recession in February. From retailers to airlines, companies have announced job cuts and furloughs. Major retailers like Brooks Brothers, J.C. Penney, J. Crew and Neiman Marcus have filed for bankruptcy.
""When the country was experiencing the first wave of the pandemic earlier this year, the bulk of business bankruptcies were smaller companies which didn't have the financial wherewithal to survive the initial shock-downturn,"" said Bill Greiner, chief economist at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Leawood, Kansas. 
""Now, we are witnessing larger company bankruptcy filings accelerating. With oil prices falling, and global demand for oil tightening, other bankruptcy filings are expected in the oil patch.""  
There were 32.9 million people receiving unemployment checks under all programs in the third week of June, up 1.411 million from the middle of the month. Economists say this number, which is reported with a two-week lag offered a more accurate picture of the labor market. The initial and continuing claims data only cover the regular state unemployment programs.
The government expanded eligibility for jobless benefits to include the self-employed and contractors, among other workers who did not qualify for unemployment insurance. It also offered an extra $600 per week in unemployment compensation to cushion against the economic hardship wrought by the pandemic.
This extra benefit expires on July 31 and economist warned that could undercut the nascent economic recovery.

""We have entered a period of rising uncertainty about the state of the recovery and companies are not stupid,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Facing an inability to forecast future demand, the best thing to do is hire cautiously, if at all, or allow payrolls to decline organically.""

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits dropped to 1.314 million in the week ending July 3, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday, a larger drop than expected but still underlining the view that the labor market faces a prolonged and difficult recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The number was lower than forecasts for 1.375 million and down from 1.413 million in the prior week, a figure that was also revised lower.
This was received positively on Wall Street, with the benchmark S&P 500 futures contract turning just positive after early losses. At 8:50 AM ET (1250 GMT), the contract traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher.
This marked the 16th straight week in which initial claims remained above 1 million, but the 14th week they have moved lower. Claims have pulled back from a record 6.86 million in late March, but the pace of decline has slowed.
The level of new layoffs continues to remain elevated, and the recent surge in Covid-19 infections has forced some states to roll back their reopening plans. 
""Unfortunately we don’t expect to see meaningful declines from these huge numbers anytime soon,"" said analysts at ING, in a research note. ""High frequency data from Homebase suggest that employment gains are already plateauing as the spike in Covid-19 cases has led several states to announce renewed containment measures while other states delay their phased re-opening.""
Continuing claims, which show the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, came in slightly below expectations at 18.062 million in the week ended June 27, down just slightly from a revised 18.76 million a week earlier.
Continuing claims figures are reported with a one-week delay but are considered offering a better view of the labor market. Continuing claims initially eased from a record high of 24.91 million in early May but have ground lower since then.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Dubai Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) increased to 50.0 in June from 46.0 in May, settling at the mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The latest PMI survey data offered hopeful signs for the Dubai non-oil private sector,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""Some sectors were on the path back to normality, according to survey respondents, though others presented a more cautious picture, finding that demand in some areas, notably travel and tourism, was still extremely weak,"" he said.
Dubai, the Middle East's trade and tourism hub, has been hit hard by virus containment measures, while the emirate lacks the oil wealth of its neighbour Abu Dhabi.
Output in the non-oil economy rose to 53.0 in June from 44.8 in May and from a record low of 36.9 in April. 
Employment, however, contracted for a fourth consecutive month.
""Despite higher demand, the hit to firms' revenues from the lockdown period meant several companies laid off staff to lower cost pressures,"" the PMI report said.
Sentiment for future activity improved for a second consecutive month in June, with more businesses optimistic about growth over the next year.

Seasonally adjusted exports surged by 9% on the month after diving by 24% in April, remaining almost 27% lower than their pre-crisis level in February, the Federal Statistics office said.
Imports rose by 3.5% after a slump of 16.6% the previous month, suggesting that consumption in Europe's largest economy remained weak. The trade surplus increased to 7.6 billion euros.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports and imports to rise by 13.8% and 12% respectively. The trade surplus was predicted to come in at 5.2 billion euros.
""All beginnings are difficult: The rise in exports is no reason to celebrate,"" Alexander Krueger of Bankhaus Lampe KG wrote in a note. ""The road to past capacity levels is long and depends strongly on the revival of international demand.""
The Statistics Office said exports to China were 12.3% lower than in May last year, while exports to the United States were down 36.5% year-on-year in May. 
As Germany's export-dependent manufacturers languish in recession, the government wants to revive the economy by boosting consumption through lower rates of value-added tax for the second half of the year and a one-off stipend for parents.
""In past recoveries, the German economy could always count on exports to kick-start the recovery,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski, adding that exports to Asia had helped Germany recover from the 2008 financial crisis.
""This time around, the economy will have to look to something other than exports to stimulate growth,"" he said and pointed to government stimulus.

Investing.com – China reported better-than expected factory gate data for June on Thursday, but persistent deflation indicated that the impact from the COVID-19 virus continues to linger.
The data, which was released by the National Bureau of Statistics earlier in the day, showed a 3% decrease in the Producer Price Index (PPI) year-on-year. The drop in the PPI was smaller compared to the previous month’s drop of 3.7% and the 3.2% drop in analyst forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Meanwhile, June’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) dropped 0.1% month-on-month, smaller than May’s 0.8% drop. But the CPI dropped 2.5% year-on-year, compared to May’s 2.4% drop.
The data gave a boost to Chinese stocks on Thursday.
The NBS said in a statement that the PPI decreased as “international commodity prices picked up, domestic manufacturing steadily recovered, and market demand continued to improve.”
Although the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19 continues, ever increasing numbers globally continues to impact global demand, pushing many factories and retailers to close.
There are over 12 million cases globally as of July 9, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
Some investors expected continued but more targeted governmental support.
“The better-than-expected PPI showed that deflationary risks at factory gates might not be so pressing, while the decline in core CPI underscores that the recovery in demand isn’t so ideal,” Betty Wang, senior economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, told Bloomberg.
“Going forward, policies will remain supportive, but they’ll likely be more targeted rather than blanket.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders unexpectedly rose in May, offering policymakers some comfort capital expenditure has held up despite the hit to corporate profits from the coronavirus pandemic.
But the increase in headline orders was due to demand from the services sector, masking a plunge in external and manufacturing orders, clouding the outlook for Japan's export-reliant economy.
""The gain is likely to be one-off given weak demand from sectors like automobile, capital goods and general-purpose machinery, which hold the key to capital spending,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Japan's economy may have hit the bottom in May. But capital expenditure likely won't turn for the better as weak demand and the risk of a second wave of infection discourage manufacturers from boosting non-urgent spending.""
Core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, rose 1.7% in May after a 12.0% slump in April, the fastest drop since 2018.
The increase confounded a 5.4% drop projected by analysts.
A 15.5% drop in manufacturers' orders was offset by a 17.7% increase in orders by non-manufacturers, the Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.
Overseas orders sank 18.5% from May to the lowest level since 2010, a sign the pandemic was hurting global demand.
""Machinery orders are hovering on a weak note,"" the Cabinet Office said, maintaining its assessment from May.
Japan slipped into recession in the first quarter as the hit from the pandemic added to woes for firms and households already reeling from last year's tax hike and soft global demand.
But capital expenditure has been underpinned by investment demand for automation and technology to offset a chronic labour shortage in the fast-ageing population.
Big firms expect to increase capital expenditure by 3.2% in the current fiscal year to March 2021, the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey showed last week.

The outlook for capital expenditure will be among key factors the BOJ will scrutinise in guiding monetary policy. It is widely expected to hold off on expanding stimulus at next week's rate review, after easing policy in March and April.

Still, the number of properties on estate agents' books stayed close to all-time lows, RICS said.

The U.S. office vacancy rate rose to 17.1% in the second quarter from 16.8%, a year earlier, while the U.S. apartment vacancy rate inched up to 4.8% from 4.6%.
Reis said the forced work-from-home option driven by the pandemic has prompted many office planners to reconsider future needs which will impact the office market for years.
""Demand for apartments could hold steady in most metros as the housing sales market will likely bear the brunt of the downturn that the pandemic has incurred,"" according to the report.
In May, U.S. home sales dropped to their lowest level in more than 9-1/2 years strengthening expectations for a sharp contraction in housing market activity in the second quarter.
Reis said that in the apartment market, the national average asking rent and effective rent rose 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, from a year ago. 
The research firm said vacancies would continue to rise and forecast rent declines for the next two quarters, especially if the Paycheck Protection Program, a government initiative to help small businesses apply for forgivable loans, and unemployment insurance are not renewed. 
The research firm said the U.S. retail vacancy rate was flat at 10.2% in the second quarter and even though retailers have re-opened in the last month, many may not survive a second wave of the virus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment jumped at a record pace in June as businesses re-opened after lockdown measures were lifted in late May, data showed on Wednesday, offering hope that the economy's coronavirus-induced slump has bottomed out.
But a recent rise in new infections in Tokyo is clouding the outlook, leaving few analysts predicting a V-shaped recovery.
""Japan's economy will hopefully pick up as business re-opens and the effect of government stimulus measures appears,"" said Takeshi Okuwaki, economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""But it will take some time for economic activity to return to pre-pandemic levels. The outlook remains severe,"" he said.
A government survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions jumped a record 23.3 points to 38.8 in June from the previous month.
The index improved for the second straight month after hitting a record low of 7.9 points in April.
But it remained well below the boom-or-bust threshold of 50, indicating more respondents think conditions are worsening rather than improving.
The outlook index, which indicates the level of confidence in future conditions, rose 7.5 points to 44.0 in June from May.
The data comes ahead of the Bank of Japan's rate review next week, when it is expected to keep policy steady and stick to its forecast of a moderate recovery later this year.
The health crisis is pushing Japan into deep recession, prompting the government to compile a massive stimulus package and the BOJ to ease policy in March and April.

Retail sales were in line with expectations and signalled a continuing recovery in the passenger car market, the association said during an online briefing. 
Luxury automakers' sales outpaced the overall market, CPCA Secretary-General Cui Dongshu said.
Sales of new energy vehicles (NEV), which include battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, hit 85,600. 
Pure battery electric vehicle sector sold 67,000 units in June with U.S. maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) accounting for 23% of the market, the CPCA said.
Cui said the association expects NEV sales in the second half this year to be significantly higher than in the same period last year.

Passenger car sales rose to 1.61 million units in May, up 1.9% from a year earlier.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy likely contracted 17% in the second quarter from the previous three months, unchanged from a June forecast and already on the heels of a 5.3% slump in the first quarter, INSEE said. 
The economy was set to rebound 19% in the third quarter and a further 3% in the fourth quarter with activity seen 1-6% below pre-crisis levels by December, it added.
Over the course of the year, INSEE estimated that the economy was set to contract 9%, France's worst recession since modern records began in 1948 but not as bad as the 11% slump the government forecast in its last revision to the 2020 budget.

The government put France under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe in mid-March, but the economy saw a ""gradual, but sharp recovery"" in the weeks after the government began lifting restrictions on May 11, INSEE said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Orders for infrastructure materials and equipment have helped industrial output recover faster in China than most places emerging from COVID-19 lockdowns, but further expansion will be hard to attain without stronger broad-based demand and exports.
Prices of copper  and steel  have surged and share prices for Chinese blue chips struck five-year highs, as state-funded infrastructure projects drove up production of cement, steel and non-ferrous metals.
Railway investment, for example, soared 11.4% in April-June from a year earlier versus a 21% drop in the first quarter.
Industries also gained from pent-up demand for autos and electronics. The property sector, a pillar of growth, also showed signs of rebounding, with real estate investment expanding and sales quickening. 
China's factory-gate prices, still in deflation territory this year, may have turned positive on a monthly basis in June, said Yating Xu, senior economist at IHS Markit, in a sign of recovering demand for manufactured goods. 
The optimism also led investment bank ING to forecast no more policy interest rate cuts from the central bank for the rest of the year. 
""We started to return to thin profit in May and became a bit better in June,"" said an official at a state-owned steel mill in central China, declining to be named due to company policy. 
""Our demand mainly come from infrastructure so far this year, especially for steel rebar and medium plates,"" he said. Steel rebars are mostly used in construction, and medium steel plates in ships and excavators. 
Underpinned by robust infrastructure demand from China, the Baltic dry index, which tracks rates for ships ferrying dry bulk commodities and reflects rates for capesize, surged about 257% in June from a low struck in May due to the freeze in global trade as a result of the lockdowns.
The rosy outlook stands in stark contrast to the dismal industrial landscapes of other economies still fighting COVID-19. Factory output plunged further in May from a year earlier in Japan, South Korea and the United States. Euro zone manufacturing output fell by a record 28% in April.

MINI-BOOM
The industrial recovery is expected to help China's economy post a positive growth rate in the second quarter after contracting for the first time in decades due to COVID-19.
But analysts warn that factories could struggle to keep up momentum even as early as this quarter as pent-up demand wanes, exports struggle and heavy floods take their toll on industries and businesses in the Yangtze Delta. 
The pent-up demand for automobiles has been released by now and the auto market entered a traditional lull in June, said the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) last week. China's passenger car retail sales fell 8% in June from a year earlier. 
In May auto sales rose for the first time after a two-year slump, fanning expectations of a strong V-shaped recovery in a pillar industry, supporting the broader economy. Auto deliveries to dealers also rose for the second straight month in May. 
Exports, a sector that provides about 200 million urban jobs, are forecast to come under pressure in the third quarter, analysts say, as sales of COVID-19-related medical supplies slow and global demand stays soft. 
Xia Xiaokang, who runs a faucet factory in the eastern city of Wenzhou, shares the same concerns. 
After a 10-day production hiatus in May, his factory reopened after receiving the go-ahead from European customers to send suspended shipments and fulfil delayed orders. 
""June was better than May, but I'm concerned about July, August and September when countries reopen but orders are so few,"" said Xia, adding that his company failed to get any new customers at the online Canton Fair - China's biggest. 

Xu from IHS said global demand may be unable to recover to pre-COVID levels in the next three years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. hiring surged to a record high in May and layoffs fell as businesses reopened, but the improvement in the labor market is likely to be blunted by a resurgence in COVID-19 cases that has forced some enterprises to shut down again.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed a rebound in job openings, a measure of labor demand, which economists said was difficult to square with the 31.5 million people collecting unemployment checks in mid-June.
""The labor market is hard to read right now with many cross-currents and anomalies as the country starts to get back up to speed,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
""It is hard to imagine these millions of job postings across the country are real. Our guess is many of the openings are merely leftovers from the best labor market in 50 years at the start of a year.""
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, report showed hiring accelerated by 2.4 million jobs to 6.5 million, the highest since the government started tracking the series in 2000. The hiring rate jumped to an all-time high of 4.9% from 3.1% in April.
The report followed on the heels of news on Friday that the economy created a record 4.8 million jobs in June. Nonfarm payrolls have rebounded after a historic plunge of 20.787 million in April as the labor market reeled from the closure of businesses in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
But the upswing in hiring has been overtaken by record spikes in new COVID-19 infections in large parts of the country, including Arizona and the highly populated states of California, Florida and Texas, which have forced several jurisdictions to scale back or pause reopenings and send some workers back home.
Even with the record hiring over the past two months, employment is 14.7 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as investors fretted over the raging COVID-19 cases. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were little changed.
LAYOFFS ABATE
Hiring in May was driven by the accommodation and food services industry. There were also increases in the healthcare and social assistance and construction businesses. With hiring rebounding, layoffs and discharges tumbled 5.9 million to 1.8 million in May. The accommodation and food services industry accounted for the bulk of the decline in layoffs. There were also decreases in the retail sector. 
The layoffs and discharge rate dropped to 1.4% from 5.9% in April. The layoffs rate hit a record high of 7.6% in March. 
Economists noted that the 1.8 million layoffs in May was much lower than the more than 8 million new applications for the regular state unemployment insurance (UI) benefits recorded during the month.
""This suggests is that a significant share of the initial UI claims in May were from layoffs in March or April, and people either waited to file claims until May, or state agencies were working through backlogs of claims,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
""Unfortunately, there are more recent indicators that layoffs are going to pick up again with people being laid off for the second time and hires will likely slow as well.""
Job openings increased 401,000 to 5.4 million on the last business day of May. There were increases in vacancies in the accommodation and food services, retail and construction industries. The rise was in the South region, which reopened businesses quicker than other parts the country. The surge in new coronavirus cases is concentrated in the South.
Job openings fell in the information, federal government and educational services sectors. The job openings rate rose to 3.9% from 3.7% in April. There were about 3.6 workers to every job opening in May. 
""Jobless workers are currently benefiting from expanded unemployment insurance, but those programs are set to expire this month, said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""These data suggest that even if workers start to search more intensely, they have fewer job opportunities.""

The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs increased 190,000 to 2.1 million. The quits rate, which is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, rose to 1.6% from a nine-year low of 1.4% in April.

Home prices and purchases have been buoyed so far this year by pent-up demand, low interest rates and a tight housing supply, but sales likely will weaken as virus cases increase and high unemployment persists. The CoreLogic Home Price Index climbed 4.8% in the 12 months through May.
“By the end of summer, buying will slacken and we expect home prices will show declines in metro areas that have been especially hard hit by the recession,” CoreLogic Chief Economist Frank Nothaft said.
U.S. virus cases increased by 2% Monday to 2.9 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. Payrolls climbed a better-than-forecast 4.8 million jobs in June, based on data before the recent surge in virus cases.
There’s at least a 75% chance of price declines in 125 metro areas by next May, led by getaway destinations in states such as Arizona and Florida that “faced the perfect storm of elevated Covid-19 cases and the subsequent collapse of the spring and summer tourism market,” according to the report. The last annual decline was in January 2012 at -0.3%.

Foreign reserves have dropped since March from a high of more than $45 billion, as investors pulled cash from emerging markets and Egypt's tourism industry, a key source of foreign revenue, came to a near standstill.
Remittances from Egyptians working abroad have also been threatened by the crisis.
To help Egypt cope, the International Monetary Fund approved $2.77 billion in emergency funding in May. Last month, Egypt secured a separate $5.2 billion standby agreement loan from the IMF.
The rise in foreign reserves registered in June could reflect the receipt of the first $2 billion tranche of the standby loan, said Allen Sandeep of Naeem Brokerage.
""We expect foreign reserves to be largely flat until the end of the year, as the interbank market is well funded to deal with the non-essential trade balances,"" said Sandeep.
While the IMF emergency funding was designed to help Egypt close a gap in its balance of payments, the standby agreement is aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability and advancing structural reform.

LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices fell for a fourth month in a row in June as COVID-19 restrictions continued to depress the market, the longest run of monthly declines since 2010, mortgage lender Halifax said on Tuesday.
Halifax said average house prices dropped by 0.1% in June after a 0.2% fall in May, a smaller decline than most economists had forecast in a Reuters poll. Prices in the three months to June were 0.9% lower than in the first quarter of 2020, the largest quarterly fall since 2011.
Britain's housing market ground to a halt in April and May, when lockdowns prevented potential buyers from visiting properties. The Bank of England said lenders approved the fewest new mortgages on record in May.
Compared with a year earlier, prices are still up by 2.5%, and Halifax said new mortgage enquiries had doubled in June - in line with reports from estate agents of a bounce in activity after lockdown restrictions ended in England.
However, the mortgage lender was cautious about the outlook.
""The near-term outlook points to a continuation of the recent modest downward trend in prices through the third quarter of the year,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said.
Many British households have been cushioned from the immediate economic impact of the lockdown by a government jobs guarantee scheme, and the Bank of England and other economists forecast a surge in unemployment when it ends later this year.
Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to consultants EY ITEM Club, said he expected prices to fall by 3% over the next few months.

""Housing market activity is likely to be limited for some time to come by the major hit that the economy has taken and the fact that consumer fundamentals have clearly taken a substantial downturn as a result of coronavirus,"" he said.

The bounce-back, more modest than the 10% rise economists had been forecasting, was led by a 27.6% surge in production of capital goods. Growth was more modest in other areas and factories churned out fewer intermediate goods.
A host of indicators have shown clear signs that the exporting powerhouse has put the worst of the impact of the coronavirus lockdown behind it: orders for industrial goods rose 10.4% in May, rebounding from their biggest drop since records began in 1991, recorded a month earlier. 
Despite the recovery, production is still well below the levels seen before the onset of the coronavirus crisis. May output was down 19% in calendar- and seasonally-adjusted terms on February, the month before lockdown measures were imposed.
""Today’s industrial production data presents a pattern we will see more often in the coming weeks and months,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.
""After the end of the lockdown measures, monthly economic data will surge but it will need more than one or two surges to bring economies back to their pre-crisis levels.""
The government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year, its worst recession since World War Two.
Nonetheless, firms are optimistic. A survey by the Ifo institute showed that they expect their production to increase in the next three months.
The government is helping the economy weather the crisis with massive rescue and stimulus packages, including rolling out short-time work, a form of state aid designed to encourage companies to keep employees on the payroll during a downturn.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending fell at the fastest pace on record in May, as consumers heeded authorities' calls to stay home to contain the coronavirus pandemic, pushing the world's third-largest economy deeper into decline.
Wages and a gauge of economic activity also tanked in the month, keeping pressure on policymakers to revive business and consumer confidence.
Household spending slumped 16.2% in May from a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, falling at the quickest pace since comparable data became available in 2001.
The drop, which was larger than a median market forecast for a 12.2% fall, extended an 11.1% decline in April.
Separate data on Tuesday showed May inflation-adjusted real wages dropped at the fastest pace since June 2015, adding to signs of stress in the labour market.
Analysts expect any recovery in spending to be slow and fragile as households remain reluctant to loosen the purse strings even after a state of emergency was lifted in May.
""The pace of recovery is worrying,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""Even though the government has rolled out policy measures, it's difficult for their impact to come out quickly.""
MIXED PICTURE
Still, the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its view in its quarterly report next week that the economy will gradually recover later this year.
Tuesday's data showed large cuts in spending on hotels, transportation and eating out. On the other hand, stay-home policies boosted spending on pork and beef, alcohol and sanitary goods like face masks and paper towels.
Last year's unprecedented 10-day Golden Week holiday to celebrate the enthronement of then-Crown Prince Naruhito made the drop in spending more pronounced, partly due to larger than usual spending on tourism in 2019, a government official said.
Policymakers hope a pickup in domestic demand will be strong enough to bring about an economic recovery, as long as Japan can avert a big second wave of coronavirus infections.
But the outlook for household spending is dim.
Japan's coincident indicator index, a gauge of the economy that includes factory output and employment, fell in May to the lowest level since 2009.
A separate BOJ survey showed Japanese households were the most pessimistic about the economy in more than a decade in the June quarter, underscoring the devastating impact the pandemic has had on consumption.
While the government compiled massive spending packages to cushion the blow from the pandemic, spending could take a larger hit if the worsening business outlook forces firms to slash workers' bonuses or lay off more workers.
""That, in turn, could cause income levels to drop further,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

""I think a phase of worsening consumption will strengthen in the second half of the year.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank held its cash rate at an all-time low on Tuesday, in a widely expected decision, and said it will help buttress the economic recovery by maintaining its accommodative approach for ""as long as it is required."" 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) left rates at 0.25% at its monthly policy meeting, and sounded cautiously optimistic about the earlier-than-expected re-opening of the country's economy, after authorities had managed to largely curb the spread of the coronavirus. 
In a short post-meeting statement Governor Philip Lowe noted Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.4 trillion) economy was in the midst of its biggest contraction since the 1930s.
""Conditions have, however, stabilised recently and the downturn has been less severe than earlier expected,"" Lowe said. 
""While total hours worked in Australia continued to decline in May, the decline was considerably smaller than in April and less than previously thought likely. There has also been a pick-up in retail spending in response to the decline in infections and the easing of restrictions in most of the country.""
Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) relatively optimistic tone comes in the wake of a significant drop in new infections across most the country, earlier-than-expected easing of restrictions, a solid pick-up in retail spending and a hefty bump in job vacancies.
However, a recent spike in coronavirus cases in Melbourne and the closure of the New South Wales-Victorian state border have cast doubts over Australia's recovery efforts. 
The RBA did not make a mention of the recent jump in cases in its statement, only repeating that the nature and speed of the economic recovery remained ""highly uncertain.""
As a result, fiscal and monetary support will likely be needed for some time, the RBA added.
The RBA has said it would scale up its government bond buying programme if further monetary stimulus was needed while reiterating the importance of fiscal response.
""In that context the governor and the RBA Board will be casting a keen eye (on) the government's announcement on July 23rd,"" said Stephen Miller, Sydney-based investment strategist at Grant Samuel Funds Management.
The government will publish a 'mini-budget statement' on July 23 setting out plans for fiscal stimulus measures. 

""It would not be a surprise if the governor were privately urging the government to maintain the current level of support...or, at a very minimum, to phase out the measures only gradually,"" Miller added.

The world's third-largest economy is bracing for its worst postwar slump in the quarter through June, with economists expecting an annualised contraction of over 20% after a massive demand shock due to lockdown measures in response to the virus outbreak.
Real wages, a gauge of household purchasing power, tumbled 2.1% in May from a year earlier, labour ministry data showed, falling at the fastest pace since a 2.8% decline in June 2015.
""The impact from the coronavirus led to a reduction in overtime pay which caused real wages to fall a lot,"" a labour ministry official told Reuters.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, saw its biggest decline since comparable data became available in January 2013, slumping 25.8% in May from a year earlier, down for a nine straight month.
The monthly wage data showed nominal total cash earnings dropped 2.1% in the year to May, also seeing their largest fall since June 2015, following a revised 0.7% drop in April.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings - was up, rising 0.2%, the data showed. One-off special payments shed 14.0% following a downwardly revised 6.4% gain in April.

The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who were employed for more than one month at a company that employed more than five people, or 2) those who were employed on a daily basis or had less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted, at a company that employs more than five people.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy could expand by an unprecedented 14% in the third quarter if activity remains at least at current levels, the Bank of France said.
It estimated that the economy had shrunk an equally unprecedented 14% in the second quarter as France began emerging from a nationwide coronavirus lockdown, slightly less than its previous projection for a 15% contraction.
The government imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe in mid-March, plunging the economy into a 5.3% slump in the first quarter alone. Lockdown restrictions began to be lifted on May 11.
The central bank estimated that the economy was operating down 7% from normal levels, an improvement from 9% last month and 32% at the start of the lockdown in March.

If the recovery keeps on track and the outbreak remains under control, the Bank of France said it could revise up its forecast for a contraction of 10% this year, which is already more optimistic than the 11% slump expected by the government.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its non-manufacturing activity index jumped to a reading of 57.1 last month, the highest since February, from 45.4 in May. It has bounced back from a reading of 41.8 in April, which was the lowest since March 2009. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index increasing to a reading of 48.9 in June.
The report followed the ISM's manufacturing survey last week showing factory activity rebounding to a 14-month high in June. The upbeat surveys, however, have been overshadowed by raging COVID-19 cases in large parts of the country, including the densely populated California, Florida and Texas.
The flare-up in cases that started in late June has prompted several states to scale back or pause reopenings, hitting restaurants and bars hard. 
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry increased to a reading of 61.6 in June from 41.9 in the prior month. There was an increase in export orders, and order backlogs swelled.
The survey's index of services industry employment rose to a reading of 43.1 last month from 31.8 in May. 

Though this measure has pulled off 30.0 in April, a level last seen in 1997, it was at odds with a report last Friday showing nonfarm payrolls surging by a record 4.8 million jobs in June. The services sector accounted for 4.263 million of the jobs.

336,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 07:11AM ET</span>","German recovery from COVID-19 will be slow and painful, data shows","By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders rebounded moderately in May and a fifth of firms in Europe's biggest economy said in a survey published on Monday they feared insolvency, adding to expectations of a slow and painful recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Germany has withstood the pandemic better than other big European countries, recording fewer COVID-19 deaths, and its economy has been relatively resilient during more than six weeks of lockdown owing to generous stimulus packages and a decision to keep open factories and construction sites.
But data showing that industrial orders had risen by a record 10.4% during a month when restrictions were gradually lifted, almost a third less than forecast in a Reuters poll, dashed hopes of a quick return to pre-crisis business activity.
""The orders data signal that the manufacturing sector recession has overcome its low point,"" the Economy Ministry said. ""But the low level of orders also shows that the recovery process is far from over.""
Order intake was 30.8% lower than in February, before lockdown measures were imposed a month later to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and almost 30% weaker than in May 2019.
Fears of a slow recovery were compounded by an Ifo economic institute survey showing that 21% of firms fear the pandemic could force them to shut down, adding to expectations that mass insolvencies in the coming months will hamstring the economy.
BOOSTING DEMAND
The services sector is most affected, Ifo said. Some 85% of travel agents and tour operators said they were threatened with insolvency, followed by 76% of hotels and 67% of restaurants.
The government wants to revive the economy by boosting consumption through lower rates of value-added tax for the second half of the year and a one-off stipend for parents.
It has also rolled out short-time work, a form of state aid designed to encourage companies to keep employees on the payroll during a downturn, which has helped stabilise the labour market.
The picture is no better for Germany's export-oriented manufacturers, which had faced declining demand before the pandemic resulting from trade disputes between the United States and China, uncertainties linked to Britain's departure from the European Union and an automotive sector grappling with an expensive shift to electric vehicles.
The government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year, which would be its deepest recession since World War Two.
Monday's data showed that order intake from the euro zone had surged by more than 20% compared with a 2% increase from countries outside the single currency bloc.
The United States and China are Germany's first and third biggest export markets, and a pronounced revival of the manufacturing sector in Europe's largest economy also depends on global trade disrupted by the pandemic returning to normal.

""Today's industrial orders data brings two important messages: the lifting of the lockdown measures has brought V-shaped surges in activity but the return to pre-crisis levels will not be easy,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski.

Sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro zone rose by 17.8% in May from April, Eurostat said, in the steepest increase since euro zone records for retail sales began in 1999.
The rise was higher than market expectations of a 15% rise on the month.
Compared to a year earlier, sales were still down 5.1% in May, showing the recovery is far from complete. But the year-on-year drop was less steep than the 7.5% fall forecast by economists polled by Reuters.
The month-on-month rise in May partly offset the record falls posted in the previous two months, with the volume of retail trade dropping by a record 12.1% in April and by 10.6% in March, Eurostat's revised data showed on Monday.
The agency had previously estimated a 11.7% month-on-month fall in April [nL8N2DH1ZR].
Sales of clothes and footwear, the sector most hit by reduced trade during the pandemic, posted a 147.0% increase in May from April, although were still down 50.5% year-on-year.
Shoppers also increased by 38.4% their purchases of fuel for cars. Trade of electrical goods and furniture shot up by 37.9%. Books and computer equipment posted a 26.8% rise in sales.
Online sales kept growing by 7.0% in May. They were the only retail sub-sector in the euro zone that did not suffer any drop in trade during lockdowns. 
Among the largest euro zone countries, retail sales went up by 13.9% in Germany and by 25.6% in France. May data for Italy were not available.

The increase was weaker than a Reuters forecast for a rise of 15% and the Economy Ministry said a return to pre-crisis levels will be slow even though the economy is recovering.
The Statistics Office data showed that domestic orders rose by 12.3% while orders from abroad were up 8.8%.
The double-digit increase in the headline figure was mainly driven by a 20.3% rise in capital goods, including a 44.4% surge in the automotive sector.
""The orders data signal that the manufacturing sector recession has overcome its low point,"" the Economy Ministry said. ""But the low level of orders also shows that the recovery process is far from over.""
Order intake was 30.8% lower than in February, before lockdown measures were imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Germany has withstood the crisis better than most of its neighbours, suffering relatively fewer deaths from the virus. Its economy has also weathered the pandemic better, partly because it let factories and construction sites remain open.
The government is helping the economy weather the crisis with massive rescue and stimulus packages, including rolling out short-time work, a form of state aid designed to encourage companies to keep employees on the payroll during a downturn.
Still, the government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year, its worst recession since World War Two.

In March, demand fell 44%, in April by 97% and in May registrations were down 89%.
The SMMT added that year-to-date, the market was almost 50% behind where it was at the same time in 2019.
Not all British car factories have reopened and many are operating at reduced capacity as manufacturers try to balance demand and supply.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.7 in June from 48.1 in May, remaining below the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""June data highlighted another difficult month for Saudi Arabia's non-oil private sector economy, with cautious business and consumer spending patterns widely reported to have held back new order intakes,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at survey compiler IHS Markit.
The June figure is a setback for the non-oil private sector, which Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has put at the centre of reforms aimed at diversifying the kingdom's oil-reliant economy.
Saudi Arabia, which had the region's highest coronavirus figures at more than 197,608 infections and 1,752 deaths as of July 1, ended a three-month curfew on June 21, although some restrictions have remained in place.
Employment in the private sector in June fell at the fastest pace since the survey began in August 2009, as firms shed jobs to reduce costs and amid concerns over the business outlook.
""June data signalled that year-ahead business expectations turned negative for the first time since this index began in July 2012,"" the IHS Markit report said.
Saudi Arabia has extended several government initiatives to support the private sector during the coronavirus outbreak, state news agency SPA reported on Thursday, citing a decision by King Salman.

But a value-added tax hike in July is expected to push up inflation, dampen consumer demand and slow down economic recovery, economists have said.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, rose to 50.4 in June from 46.7 in May, edging above the 50.0 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
""At 50.4 in June, the UAE PMI signalled the first stage of recovery in the non-oil private sector. More firms are now seeing an increase in activity as opposed to a decline, while new orders grew at the fastest rate in ten months,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Output levels grew at their strongest pace since October last year and new orders grew at their fastest since August as demand improved after the easing of lockdown measures.
In late June, the UAE announced the lifting of a nightly curfew in place since mid-March. The daily number of infections has fallen from a peak of some 900 in late May to average between 300 and 400 in recent weeks.
As of July 1, the UAE had reported 49,069 cases of the new coronavirus and 316 deaths.
Despite the jump in the headline index, companies are still cutting costs after months of lower activity, which led to a drop in the employment sub-index to 46.4 from 48.7 in May.

""Evidence from panellists suggested that balance sheets remain in a tricky situation, as firms made another solid cut to workforces in order to reduce costs. Thus it may be a long path to recovery for the labour market,"" Owen said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil contracted significantly in June for a fourth month, a survey of purchasing managers' activity showed on Friday, as the COVID-19 crisis ensured Latin America's largest economy ended the second quarter on a weak footing.
There was, however, a sharp divergence between manufacturing, which expanded slightly, and the dominant services sector, which remained under severe pressure and shed jobs at the fastest pace on record.
IHS Markit's Brazil services purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to 35.9 in June from 27.6 in May, and the composite PMI encompassing manufacturing rose to 40.5 from 28.1. 
Although both headline indexes rose on the month, they still signaled steep declines in activity: a reading above 50.0 marks expansion, while a reading below signifies contraction. Both marked the fourth month in a row of shrinking activity.
Paul Smith, economics director at data provider IHS Markit, said the April-June PMIs are consistent with Brazil's gross domestic product falling by around 7-8% in the second quarter, maybe more. GDP shrank 1.5% in the January-March period.
""Despite easing somewhat since May, the downturn in Brazil's services economy remains severe and of an unprecedented nature,"" Smith said. ""Indeed, the latest data on activity and new business was again quite simply awful,"" he added.
Brazil's economy is expected to shrink by a record 6.3% this year, according to a Reuters poll of economists. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting a crash of 9.1%.
The services employment index reading of 34.9 in June was the lowest since the index was constructed in 2007, IHS Markit said. The new business, outstanding business and new export business indexes all remained well blow 50.0.

On the upside, the services business expectations index jumped to 57.0, although Smith cautioned that even that is consistent with ""historically muted"" sentiment.

LONDON (Reuters) - The plunge in euro zone business activity caused by lockdowns imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus eased sharply last month as more businesses reopened and people ventured out, a survey showed on Friday.
Around 11 million people have been infected by the virus globally, but as the number of daily reported cases has fallen across much of Europe governments have loosened restrictions on people's movement.
To support ravaged economies the European Central Bank expanded its pandemic-related bond purchases to a total of 1.35 trillion euros last month while governments have waded in with unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus. 
That may be paying dividends as IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, bounced to 48.5 in June from May's 31.9, better than a 47.5 preliminary reading and close to the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
""The sharp increases in the euro zone PMIs in June suggest that activity is bouncing back quite quickly, but remains far lower than before the crisis,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
A June Reuters poll predicted the economy contracted an unprecedented 12.5% last quarter but would grow 7.9% this quarter. 
World shares inched towards a four-month high on Friday and industrial bellwether metal copper was set for its longest weekly winning streak in nearly three years, as recovering global data kept nagging coronavirus nerves at bay. 
DAMP DEMAND
Activity in the bloc's dominant service industry also almost returned to growth last month. Its PMI soared to 48.3 from 30.5, comfortably ahead of the 47.3 flash reading.
However, demand still fell despite vendors cutting prices, and firms reduced headcount for a fourth straight month. The services employment index rose to 43.9 from 37.9, still one of the lowest readings in the survey's 22-year history.
Unemployment in the bloc edged up in May, official data showed on Thursday.
""The employment index has not rebounded anywhere near as sharply as the output PMI, implying that the increase in activity in recent months is a long way from strong enough to provoke an increase in hiring,"" Allen-Reynolds said. 
""Instead, the PMI still points to steep declines in employment.""
That weak demand is holding up a more pronounced recovery in Germany's services sector, which is slowly coming back to life after Europe's largest economy lifted restrictions, earlier data showed.
French service sector activity returned to growth as its lockdown was further eased, boosting overall business activity, while in Britain -- outside the currency union -- an historic slump levelled off as some of the economy reopened.
Optimism about the year ahead returned. The euro zone composite future output index climbed back into positive territory, recording 56.9 versus May's 46.8.

The index thus rose above the 50-point threshold dividing expansions in activity from contractions for the first time since February, before the coronavirus outbreak reached France.
The government imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe in mid-March, forcing most service providers to temporarily shut down their businesses until restrictions began to be lifted on May 11.
Combined with already published data for the manufacturing sector, the overall PMI index covering both sectors rose to 51.7 from 32.1 in May, better than the 51.3 originally reported.
""Although the recovery was predominantly driven by manufacturers, service providers also posted an expansion in activity,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.

Analysts predict the economy is on course for a significant contraction in the second quarter as the coronavirus outbreak hits global demand for goods and keeps businesses closed.
Household spending is expected to have fallen 12.2% in May from a year earlier, which would be the fastest pace of decline since comparable data became available in 2001, the poll of 16 economists showed. It would also follow an 11.1% drop in April.

The poll also found machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, declined 5.4% in May from the previous month, after a 12.0% drop in April.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 58.4, the highest reading since April 2010, from May's 55.0, pulling further away from the trough hit in February as the coronavirus lockdown paralysed the economy.
The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The rebound suggests China's overall recovery is becoming more balanced and broader based as life slowly returns to normal in one of the world's biggest consumer markets, though analysts believe it will take months for activity to return to pre-crisis levels.
The services sector accounts for about 60% of the economy and half of the urban jobs, and includes many small, private companies which had been slower to recover initially than large manufacturers. Heavy job losses, pay cuts and fears of a second wave of infections have made some consumers cautious about spending and going out again.
""This (latest survey) suggests the services sector’s recovery is gaining traction,"" said analysts at Nomura, which recently raises its forecast for China's second-quarter GDP growth to 2.6% year-on-year from 1.2%.
""However, we caution that the recovery momentum could lose some steam in coming months.""
The Caixin survey showed a sub-index for new business received by Chinese services firms rose to 57.3 from 55.8 in May, with the rate of growth accelerating to the fastest since August 2010.
New export business also expanded for the first time since January on firmer foreign demand, in contrast to overseas orders for manufactured goods, which continued to contract as many of China's trading partners remained in lockdowns.
Services companies were also able to raise their prices slightly, ending a six-month streak of discounting as firms promote sales, while business confidence over the next 12 months strengthened to a three-year high.
But employment remained stuck in contractionary territory for fifth consecutive month, with corporate headcounts falling at a faster pace than in May, highlighting the immense pressure facing Chinese policymakers this year as they vow to stabilise the labour market.
""Although businesses were optimistic about the economic outlook, they remained cautious about increasing hiring, with employment in both the manufacturing and services sectors shrinking,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, in an statement accompanying the data release.
""Addressing the employment problem requires not only macro policies to further promote work resumption, but also more targeted relief measures introduced by governments to tide companies over.""
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, picked up to 55.7 in June from 54.5 in May.
China's economy is gradually emerging from a sharp 6.8% contraction in the first quarter, with much of the country now reopened after disruptions early in the year due to strict lockdown measures.

But analysts warned that a new surge of COVID-19 cases in the capital Beijing and some surrounding cities threatens to undercut growth, with many entertainment venues remaining shut due to concerns about infections.

Investing.com – China released the results of a private survey of Chinese small- and medium-sized firms released on Friday, showing that the country’s services sector grew its fastest pace in over a decade in June. This growth was bolstered by increased consumer demand as COVID-19 lockdown measures were eased.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI)  came in at 58.4 for June, higher than the previous month’s figure of 55 as well as the highest reading since April 2010.
The reading follows the National Bureau of Statistics’ report of a better-than-expected manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index  (PMI) of 50.9 earlier in the week.
Both figures were above the 50-mark indicating economic growth and indicated a more balance and broader economic recovery from COVID-19.
But investors cautioned that the country’s recovery to pre-pandemic levels could take months, with continuous heavy jobs losses and a resurgence in cases in Beijing originating from the Xinfadi market dampening sentiment.
The rebound suggests China’s overall recovery is becoming more balanced and broader based as life slowly returns to normal in one of the world’s biggest consumer markets, though analysts believe it will take months for activity to return to pre-crisis levels.
“Although businesses were optimistic about the economic outlook, they remained cautious about increasing hiring, with employment in both the manufacturing and services sectors shrinking,” Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, said in a statement accompanying the data release.
“Addressing the employment problem requires not only macro policies to further promote work resumption, but also more targeted relief measures introduced by governments to tide companies over.”

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's crippled services industry, the lifeblood of economic growth and jobs, contracted sharply in June as an extended lockdown imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus stalled business activity, a private sector survey showed.
Although the pace of decline moderated from May - the Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index  jumped to 33.7 in June from May's 12.6 - it remained a long way from the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
June was the fourth straight month the index was sub-50, the longest such stretch since a ten-month run to April 2014.
""India's service sector continued to struggle in June as the country's coronavirus crisis worsened,"" Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.
""Simply put, the country is gripped in an unprecedented economic downturn which is certainly going to spill over into the second half of this year unless the infection rate can be brought under control.""
The lockdown of 1.3 billion people, which started on March 25, has been extended in some areas until the end of July as India now has over 600,000 coronavirus cases, fewer than only the United States, Brazil and Russia.
Although improved from May, sub-indexes showed domestic and foreign demand continued to decline sharply leading firms to cut jobs for the fourth straight month in June.
And with forward looking indicators giving little hope for an imminent turnaround, firms were at their most pessimistic about the year ahead since the survey began in December 2005.
A composite PMI, which includes manufacturing and services, also pointed to a deep contraction in Asia's third-largest economy, which a Reuters poll said shrank 5.2% last quarter. It registered at 37.8, up from May's 14.8.[ECILT/IN] 
""A large fraction of the survey panel are still reporting falling activity and order book volumes, reflecting an intensely challenging domestic picture in India,"" IHS Markit's Hayes added.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 10:30PM ET</span>",Australia retail sales see record surge in May as economy reopens,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales saw a record surge in May, official data showed on Friday, as a wide scale easing in coronavirus lockdowns allowed entire sectors to reopen, enabling a recovery from an historic plunge in April.
The strong bounce suggests consumer spending will not be nearly as weak as first feared in the June quarter, offering hope the economy can recover quickly from its first recession in three decades.
Retail sales jumped a seasonally adjusted 16.9% in May, from April when it tumbled 17.7%. Sales were also up over 5% on May last year at A$28.97 billion ($20.06 billion), according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
Australia eased lockdown restrictions in May as it successfully contained the spread of the virus and reopened its economy before many other advanced nations. The country has just over 8,000 coronavirus cases with 104 deaths. 
Also in May, there was a massive month-on-month increase of 129.2% in clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing. Cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services saw a surge of 30.3%, with both sectors coming off very low levels of trade in April. 
Levels in clothing and footwear industries however remain well below the same time last year, the ABS reported.
The optimism since late April has also been reflected in credit card spending by major banks. 
According to the Commonwealth Bank (CBA), card spending in the week to June 26 was up 4.5% on a year ago after a 7.1% lift for the week ended June 19. 
Separate data from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries showed the slowest decline in new vehicle sales since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. New vehicle sales fell 6.4% compared with June 2019, following double digit year-on-year declines in March, April and May.
Economists are keeping a close eye on the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) monthly policy meeting on Tuesday for any upgrades in forecasts ahead of its quarterly outlook due in August.

The final Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 45.0 in June from 26.5 in May.
The reading was better than a preliminary 42.3 released last week and marked the biggest index rise in a single month on record, with data going back to September 2007. That suggested business conditions were gradually returning to normal in the world's third-largest economy.
Still, the index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the fifth straight month, matching a similar run to September 2012, suggesting firms continue to struggle with below-capacity operations and low customer numbers.
""Until demand rises persistently at a strong rate, we can expect a sluggish recovery,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""We have to remember that Japan's economy was already in a recession before the second quarter and 2020 was set to be economically challenging.""
Japan fell into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the three months through March and is set to suffer its deepest postwar slump in the current quarter.
The survey showed broader conditions were still fragile, with the majority of businesses seeing no change or a further drop in new workloads, while firms also said operating requirements remained low due to weak demand.

The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, also pointed to a slower pace of activity decline, rising to a four-month high of 40.8 from May's final 27.8.

Some 46% of manufacturers expect to make redundancies over the next six months, up sharply from 25% in May, according to sectoral group Make UK which is calling on the government take more measures immediately to support jobs.
""Conditions are still very tough for many companies with disruption likely to continue for some time,"" said Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK.
""This has led some to reluctantly conclude that with demand unlikely to return for some time, if at all, they are moving to the painful choice of redundancy.""
The survey showed only a slight improvement in gauges of revenue and new orders.
Make UK said finance minister Rishi Sunak - who has already announced around 133 billion pounds' ($166 billion) worth of emergency measures, mostly to protect jobs - should consider cutting business rate taxes for manufacturers, a priority for 61% of the companies surveyed.
Sunak is due to announce an update to his plans for steering the economy through the coronavirus crisis on July 8.
In June, the Bank of England said Britain's economy looked on course to have shrunk by around 20% in the first six months of 2020.
A separate survey of consumers published on Friday showed a small improvement in morale late last month, even though their confidence in the economy remained badly shaken.
The GfK Consumer Confidence Index rose to -27 from a reading of -30 published in mid-June, its highest level since lockdown began and helped by an improvement in the survey's gauge of personal finances.
The Make UK survey of 274 manufacturers was conducted June 22-29. GfK surveyed 2,000 consumers for the European Commission from June 18 to June 26.

In an article in Friday's paper, Tagesspiegel quoted the head of the International Carmakers' Association as saying that 220,000 new cars were registered in June, in calendar-adjusted terms a 40% fall over June 2019.
The numbers, showing the impact of the coronavirus crisis and the economic hit caused by months of lockdown, are further bad news for a sector that has been buffeted by the transition away from combustion engines and scandals over emissions.
For the full year, association head Reinhard Zirpel the number of new vehicles registered in 2020 was expected to fall 20% over the previous year to 2.8 million. The last time so few cars were sold was 1989 - the year of German reunification at the end of the Cold War.
But even that was an optimistic prognosis, Zirpel said.
""The cumulative minus up to the end of June is -35%,"" he said. ""There will have to be a very strong recovery in the second half to reach -20% at the end.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created jobs at a record clip in June as more restaurants and bars reopened, but 31.5 million Americans were collecting unemployment checks in the middle of the month, and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases suggested the labor market could suffer a setback in July.
Record spikes in new coronavirus infections in large parts of the country, including Arizona and the highly-populated states of California, Florida and Texas, have forced several jurisdictions to scale back or pause reopenings, and send some workers back home.
The flare-up in the respiratory illness, which started in late June and hit bars and restaurants hard, was not captured in the Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report published on Thursday because the government surveyed businesses in the middle of the month.
""June may be the calm before the storm,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""We cannot be sure the labor market recovery will continue at a speed that is sufficient to put the millions and millions of Americans made jobless in this recession back to work."" 
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 4.8 million jobs in June, the most since the government started keeping records in 1939. Payrolls rebounded 2.699 million in May after a historic plunge of 20.787 million in April. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 3 million jobs in June. Still, employment is 14.7 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level. The jobs recouped are for workers who were temporarily unemployed. 
President Donald Trump, whose opinion poll numbers have tanked as he struggles to manage the pandemic, economic crisis and protests over racial injustice four months before the Nov. 3 election, hailed the job gains as proof ""our economy is roaring back.""
Though the second straight month of strong hiring added to a stream of data, including consumer spending, in suggesting that the recession which started in February was likely over, that is all history as the coronavirus rages.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week said the economic outlook ""is extraordinarily uncertain"" and would depend on ""our success in containing the virus.""
Hiring last month was boosted by the typically low-paying leisure and hospitality industry, which brought back 2.1 million jobs, accounting for about two-fifths of the rise in payrolls.
The return of these workers pushed down average wages 1.2%. Companies are cutting wages and hours. The average workweek dropped to 34.5 hours from 34.7 hours in May.
The measurement of the unemployment rate continued to be biased downward by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work"" last month. The jobless rate fell to 11.1% from 13.3% in May. 
Without the misclassification, it would have been 12.3%. The unemployment rate is 7.6 percentage points above its February level. Unemployment dropped for all gender and demographic groups, though joblessness stayed disproportionately high among Blacks and Hispanics. The number of people who have permanently lost their job increased 588,000 to 2.9 million.
""These workers will likely struggle to regain employment in an economy facing suppressed demand,"" said Beth Akers, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. 
Stocks on Wall Street rallied, with the Nasdaq hitting an all-time high. The dollar (DXY) edged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher.

BROAD GAINS
Jobs also returned in the retail, education and health, manufacturing, construction, professional and business services sectors, transportation and warehousing, wholesale trade and financial activities sectors. 
Local governments hired teachers and support staff. But state governments, confronting reduced revenues and stressed budgets caused by the pandemic, laid off more workers. There were further job losses in mining. 
Hiring has been boosted by the government's Paycheck Protection Program, which gives businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for wages. Those funds are drying up and many companies, including some not initially impacted by lockdown measures, are struggling with weak demand, forcing them to lay off workers. 
That has triggered a second wave of layoffs, keeping weekly new applications for unemployment benefits extraordinarily high.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 55,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.427 million for the week ended June 27.
The claims report is the most timely data on the economy's health. Including a program funded by the government, 2.3 million people filed claims last week.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 59,000 to 19.290 million in the week ending June 20. There were 31.5 million people receiving unemployment checks in mid-June, up 916,722 from the first week of the month. 
With roughly a fifth of the workforce on jobless rolls, economists say the government should extend the extra $600 it pays per week in unemployment compensation when that benefit expires on July 31.

""Failure to take action would severely dent the chances of a rapid recovery,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.

Jobless rates for both fell in June, but the rate for whites came down at a much faster rate. The white unemployment rate fell by 2.3 percentage points to 10.1% from 12.4%, while the rate for Blacks dropped by 1.4 points to 15.4% from 16.8%.
At 5.3 percentage points, the gap is now the widest since May 2015.
(Graphic: Black vs white unemployment, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnzjqxpl/Pasted%20image%201593694194843.png) 
The pandemic brought an abrupt end to the record-long U.S. economic expansion just as it was creating better job opportunities for Black workers and other minorities. And the job losses seen during the downturn have fallen hardest on Black workers, Hispanic workers and women, wiping out some of their recent wins. 
The widening spread between racial group jobless rates in the last two months has reversed years of gains toward slowly bringing unemployment rates between Blacks and whites closer to parity. 

Last August, the unemployment rate for Black workers dropped to a record low of 5.4% and the gap between Black and white workers narrowed to 2 points, the narrowest since the Labor Department retooled its measurement of employment by race in 1972.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian manufacturing activity contracted for the fourth straight month in June as the coronavirus crisis curbed demand from domestic and export markets, but was well above April's record-low hinting at a turnaround, data showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 47.8 in June from 40.6 in May, well above April's 33.0. A reading below 50 shows contraction in the sector.
""The latest Canada Manufacturing PMI highlights a vastly improved situation in comparison to that seen over the previous three months,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, in a statement.
""June data signalled that the overall downturn in output, order books and jobs eased to its least marked since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold.""
The output index rose to 45.5 in June from 33.0 in May, while the measure of new orders was up to 45.5 from 37.9.
""Despite another improvement in their expectations for production during the year ahead, manufacturers continued to report highly subdued underlying demand in June,"" Moore said.
The measure of suppliers' delivery times rose to 37.5 from 30.9 in May, while the employment index was up at 44.8 from 32.7.

Canada unexpectedly added almost 290,000 jobs in May as some provinces loosened COVID-19 restrictions on businesses, while GDP was estimated to rise 3% in May.

Investing.com --The U.S. labor market extended its recovery from April’s collapse in June, creating over 1.5 million more jobs than expected as lockdown restrictions across the nation were eased.
U.S. stock futures extended their premarket gains on the back of the news. By 8:47 AM ET (1247 GMT), the Dow Jones 30 Futures contract leaped 170 points from its pre-publication level to be up 1.6% from the previous session's close. The Nasdaq 100 Futures contract was up 1.0%, while the S&P 500 Futures was up 1.3%.  U.S. Crude Oil futures also extended their overnight gains to be quoted at $40.22 a barrel, up 1.0%.
The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose by an estimated 4.800 million in the month to mid-June, compared to an average forecast ahead of time of 3.000 million. An upside surprise had been on the cards after an unexpectedly strong report on private payrolls from ADP on Wednesday. 
Over 3 million of the 4.8 million jobs added were in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors, which had all been paralysed by the imposition of lockdowns and other social distancing measures in March and April.
Other sectors to report a big rebound in employment included manufacturing, where payrolls grew by 356,000, adding to the 250,000 jobs created by the sector a month earlier. One negative outlier, noted Harvard Professor Jason Furman via Twitter, was at the level of state government, which shed another 25,000 jobs in June. 
""This is the fourth month in a row that state governments have lost jobs. And it will only get worse without fiscal relief,"" Furman argued.
There was a bigger fly in the ointment, too, as more up-to-date and higher-frequency numbers showed that the recent trend of improving labor market conditions was flattening out. 
Initial jobless claims last week came in at 1.427 million, barely down from 1.482 million a week earlier and again above consensus forecasts for a drop to 1.355 million.
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, edged up to 19.29 million from an upwardly revised 19.23 million a week earlier, disappointing hopes for a decline to 19.00 million.
Gregory Daco, an analyst with Oxford Economics, pointed to ""another worryingly small decline in initial claims"" and said that while payrolls have risen by a net 7.5 million over the two months to mid-June, ""layoffs are still happening.""
Daco noted that the net loss of jobs since February was still over 14 million."

The seasonally adjusted rate increased to 7.4% in May from 7.3% in April and 7.1% in March, the lowest level since records began in 1998.
May brought the second consecutive monthly rise, but it was less than the market expectation of 7.7%.
The only modest increase suggests furlough schemes providing temporary layoff are keeping many of those laid off during the COVID-19 pandemic out of the main unemployment records, although a number of these schemes will start to taper.
The situation was worse for women and youths.
Unemployment for people aged under 25 rose to 16.0% in May from 15.7% in April and 15.0% in March, a 19-year low. In Spain, about a third of young people were without a job.
For women, the jobless rate rose to 7.9% from 7.7% in April. For men, it was unchanged at 7.0%.
Separately, Eurostat said industrial producer prices fell by 0.6% month-on-month in May and by 5.0% year-on-year, steeper than the market consensus of down 0.5% and 4.8% respectively.
Energy prices fell by the most, but no component of the index rose month-on-month. Prices for capital goods and durable consumer goods were unchanged. These two categories, along with non-durable consumer goods, were modestly up year-on-year.
Producer prices are a key factor shaping consumer inflation, which the European Central Bank wants to keep below but close to 2% over the medium term, as changes in prices at factory gates largely translate into the final cost for consumers.

(Reuters) - The end of the coronavirus lockdown in Spain failed to bring a surge in employment as government data showed that the 900,000 jobs lost at the pandemic's peak had not been regained, while the tourism sector has not yet returned to regular activity.
The number of people in Spain registering as jobless rose by 0.13% in June from a month earlier, or by 5,017 people, leaving 3.86 million people out of work, Labour Ministry data showed on Thursday. 
The number of registered jobless people had risen in May by 0.68%. Overall there were 847,197 more jobless people in June than in the same month a year ago. 
A net 99,906 jobs were lost in June. 
According to data from the Social Security Ministry, on average 68,208 new jobs were registered in June compared to May, but 161,500 people were fired on the last day of the month.
The Social Security spokesman told a news conference that on the first day of July all that employment had already been recovered, and blamed these strong variations on the high temporary rates of the Spanish labour market. 
On June 30, a large part of the ERTE furlough scheme in Spain expired. The extension of the scheme until September 30 did not apply to all the companies as conditions changed.
At least 1.17 million workers left the ERTE scheme in June.
The government expects to reduce its spending on employment benefits by 1 billion euros in June. 
Although benefit spending data for last month is not yet available, in May, 5.52 billion euros was paid out in 6 million benefits, 3.3 for ERTE workers and 2.2 in jobless.
The Secretary of State for Employment, Joaquín Pérez Rey, expects at least 850,000 fewer benefits to be paid in june.
EDUCATION AND HOSPITALITY LAG
Education was the sector that dragged the jobs market in June, losing more than 45,000 jobs in a month, extending even its previous fall during the lockdown.
On the other hand, construction was the most dynamic sector in June, and has almost overtaken all the jobs lost in the closing. 
The hospitality industry is the sector that has lost the most jobs yearly, with almost 300,000 jobs shed. 
The opening of bars and restaurants in June helped 20,000 people to find employment in the sector, but it was insufficient to compensate for the massive loss of jobs at the peak of the pandemic.
Tourism accounts for almost 13% of the Spanish economy, largely thanks to foreign visitors. Schengen Area borders opened on June 21.

No tourists travelled to Spain in May for second month in a row because of the coronavirus lockdown, dragging income by more than 60% in the first five months of the year, the National Statistics Office (INE) said on Thursday.

A Reuters survey of nine analysts had forecast a jobless rate of 7.7%.
May is the third month of jobs data to reflect the impact of Italy's outbreak of the coronavirus which came to light on Feb 21.
The government's lockdown measures aimed at containing infections brought the economy to its knees, with most firms shuttered throughout March and April.
The jobless rate plummeted in those two months as people stopped looking for work. The rise in May reflects the gradual end of the lockdown and Italians returning to the labour market.
Only people actively looking for a job count towards the unemployment rate.
The government has pledged more than 75 billion euros in financial support for companies and families, and Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has said repeatedly that ""nobody must lose their job because of the coronavirus.""
However, ISTAT's data on Thursday showed that in the three months to May some 381,000 jobs were lost compared with the December-February period.
Until the virus outbreak the Italian labour market had held up relatively well, despite an economy which was broadly stagnant for over a year.
In the first quarter of this year gross domestic product plunged 5.3% due to the virus outbreak, the steepest quarterly drop since the current series began in 1995.
The second quarter, which contains more days affected by the lockdown, is expected to post an even steeper decline, before a partial rebound over the second half of the year.
In May, the youth unemployment rate, measuring job-seekers between 15 and 24 years old, rose to 23.5% from 21.5%.
Italy's overall employment rate, one of the lowest in the euro zone, fell in May to 57.6% from 57.9% in April, reaching its lowest since December 2016.

368,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 02:08PM ET</span>","Fed Looks to Bolster Forward Guidance; Mulls Yield Curve Control , Minutes Show","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers discussed the need to bolster forward guidance in the coming months when they met last month, and suggested that the jury was still out on the use of yield curve control, according to the Fed's June meeting minutes released Wednesday.
""Various participants noted that the economy is likely to need support from highly accommodative monetary policy for some time and that it will be important in coming months for the Committee to provide greater clarity regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases,"" according to the minutes. 
There was also support to tie forward guidance to economic metrics, with a number of policymakers suggesting future monetary policy be linked to inflation outcomes. 
""Participants generally indicated support for outcome-based forward guidance. A number of participants spoke favorably of forward guidance tied to inflation outcomes that could possibly entail a modest temporary overshooting of the committee's longer-run inflation goal but where inflation fluctuations would be centered on 2 percent over time,"" the minutes showed. 
Fed members discussed two tools for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchase programs in supporting employment and inflation and an approach that caps or targets interest rates along the yield curve -- a measure allowing central banks to target specific government bond yields through the purchase and sale of bonds, to help keep lending rates near zero.
Debate Over Yield Curve Control
Pointing to a review of the yield caps or targets (YCT) policies the Federal Reserve followed during and after World War II and that the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of Australia are currently employing, nearly all Federal Open Market Committee members indicated that they had many questions regarding the costs and benefits of such an approach. 
""The three experiences suggested that credible yield curve target (YCT) policies can control government bond yields... and may not require large central bank purchases of government debt,"" the minutes showed. ""But the staff also highlighted the potential for YCT policies to require the central bank to purchase very sizable amounts of government debt under certain circumstances ... and the possibility that, under YCT policies, monetary policy goals might come in conflict with public debt management goals, which could pose risks to the independence of the central bank.""
With the central bank is likely to persist with ensuring rates remain lower for longer, yield curve control is unlikely to make into the Fed's toolbox in the immediate future. ""Yield curve control is still under discussion, though FOMC members still have “many questions” on the costs and benefits. It’s probably not imminent,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said. 
Following their June 9-10 meeting, Fed officials left interest rates in the range of 0%-to-0.25% and signaled that near zero rates would continue through at least 2022.
In their post-meeting statement, they vowed to persist with bond purchases ""at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.""
The Fed committed to buying $80 billion a month in Treasuries and $40 billion a month in agency mortgage backed securities.
The Fed's balance sheet has declined by $12.4 billion to $7.08 trillion as of June. 24, compared with the week prior, driven by a decline in demand for the Fed's dollar swap lines from overseas central banks.
The U.S. central bank's balance sheet stood at about $4 trillion just before the pandemic struck in the U.S. in early March.
Threat of a Second Wave
Since the Fed's last meeting, the U.S. has seen a greater resurgence in infections that has forced states to roll back plans to speed up the pace of reopening businesses. 
In testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, acknowledged the threat of a potential second wave of infections on the economy.
A second wave could ""force government and force people to withdraw again from economic activity ... and ""undermine public confidence, which is what we need to get back to lots of economic activity,"" Powell said.
""Output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels. The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus,"" he added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in June as reopening businesses showed little urgency to rehire workers and employers announced more than 170,000 layoffs, bolstering views the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic would be a long slog.
Other data on Wednesday showed manufacturing activity rebounding in June, hitting its highest level in 14 months as firms and businesses resumed operations. But a surge in coronavirus cases across the country, including the populous California, Florida and Texas, threaten the budding recovery. 
Several states are scaling back or pausing reopenings, and 
the record number of infections has consumers growing ever more anxious.
The economy slipped into recession in February.
""A resurgence of the virus is likely to lead to another pause in economic activity over the near-term,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. 
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 2.369 million jobs last month. Data for May was revised up to show payrolls surging 3.065 million, in line with a surprise rebound in job growth reported by the government, instead of tumbling 2.76 million as previously estimated.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls increasing by 3.0 million in June. 
Job growth has rebounded mostly as companies rehired workers laid off when businesses were shuttered in mid-March to control the spread of COVID-19. But some companies are struggling with weak demand forcing them to lay off workers.
A separate report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Wednesday showed employers announced 170,219 job cuts in June. Though layoffs last month were down 57% from May, they jumped 306% compared to June last year. 
""We are beginning to see the impact of the recession spreading to companies that were not directly impacted by the virus,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""At the same time, companies that attempted to reopen but were only able to attract a fraction of their pre-COVID customers are closing down again. Meanwhile, a number of high-profile companies are filing for bankruptcy.""
According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, layoffs totaled an all-time high of 1.238 million in the second quarter, up 257% from the January-March period.
A third report, from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), showed its index of national factory activity jumped to 52.6 last month from 43.1 in May. That was the strongest since April 2019 and ended three straight months of contraction. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy.

Manufacturers welcomed the reopening of the economy, but worried that the recovery was ""slow"" and ""supply could be hindered if another wave of COVID-19 hits in the fall."" 
The survey's measure of factory employment contracted for an 11th straight month and the ISM noted that ""long-term labor market growth remains uncertain.""
""The jump may just reflect the relief about reopening rather than signal a full rebound for a sector that still faces major headwinds,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Factories are not laying off workers to the extent that they were in May, but major rehiring is not happening yet.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
DEEP HOLE
The ADP report, jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for June scheduled for release on Thursday. U.S. financial markets and the government will be closed on Friday in observance of Saturday's Independence Day holiday.
The ADP report has a poor track record forecasting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report because of methodology differences. It failed to predict the rebound in job growth in May. The government nonfarm payrolls count is compiled from a survey of businesses while the ADP figures are derived from ADP payroll data and other inputs.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the employment report will likely show private employers hired 2.9 million workers in June. That would lead to nonfarm payrolls increasing by 3 million on top of the 2.5 million created in May. 
Still, payrolls would be about 16.6 million below their pre-pandemic level. The jobless rate is forecast dipping to 12.3% from 13.3% in May.
Employment gains in the ADP report last month were led by the leisure and hospitality industry as restaurants and bars reopened. There also were strong job gains in the healthcare and construction sectors. But mining payrolls fell and manufacturing employment increased moderately. (Graphic: Where the jobs are and aren't returning, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvoraegpd/Pasted%20image%201593608311700.png) 

""While the jobs recovery is encouraging, it's disconcerting that it's solely based on the rehiring of workers by businesses reopening,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""The hiring related to businesses reopening will dry up and we might see a weakening in job growth.""

370,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing activity hits 14-month high,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity rebounded in June, hitting its highest level in more than a year as the broader economy reopened, but rising COVID-19 infections threaten the recovery. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 52.6 last month from 43.1 in May. That was the strongest since April 2019 and ended three straight months of contraction.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 49.5 in June.
The rebound in the ISM index was in tandem with improvements in regional manufacturing surveys and added to data on job growth, consumer spending and the housing market in suggesting that the economy had turned the corner after sliding into recession in February. 
The uptick in economic activity follows the reopening of many businesses after being shuttered in mid-March in a bid to slow the spread of the respiratory illness. 
But the resumption of operations has been accompanied by a surge in coronavirus cases across large parts of the country, including the densely populated California, Florida and Texas, prompting authorities to scale back or pause reopenings. 
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index jumped to a reading of 56.4 in June, the highest since January 2019, from 31.8 in May. Though the survey's measure of order backlogs at factories rose last month they remained lean. Export orders also remained in the contraction zone.
Factory employment improved last month, though still mired in contraction territory. The ISM's manufacturing employment measure rose to a reading of 42.1 from 32.1 in May, underscoring the depth of the jobs deficit caused by COVID-19.

The government's closely followed employment report to be released on Thursday is expected to show 3 million jobs created in June on top of the 2.5 million added in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave nonfarm payrolls nearly 17 million below their pre-pandemic level.

Investing.com - The U.S. private sector added 2.36 million jobs in June, according to a report by payrolls processor ADP, as businesses reopened after closing in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected the private sector to have added 3 million jobs last month.
May’s figure was revised to show job gains of 3.065 million from the decline of 2.7 million that was initially reported.
“Small business hiring picked up in the month of June,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. “As the economy slowly continues to recover, we are seeing a significant rebound in industries that once experienced the greatest job losses. In fact, 70 percent of the jobs added this month were in the leisure and hospitality, trade and construction industries.”
On Tuesday Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that while recent signs of improvement including a surprise gain in employment and a record rise in retail sales last month are encouraging, the damage inflicted by forced economic shutdowns to curb the spread of the virus has left a very deep hole to fill, especially on the employment front.
The ADP numbers come ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for June on Thursday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. The government jobs data is being released a day earlier than usual because of the Independence Day holiday.
That report is expected to show that the unemployment rate ticked down to around 12.3% last month from 13.3% in May with employers forecast to have added 3 million jobs, up from 2.5 million in May. While that would be a second month of record gains the overall trend remains unclear amid widespread data collection issues.
At the same time, Thursday’s weekly jobless claims report is expected to show another surge of new claims for unemployment benefits.
Initial weekly claims for unemployment benefits have been stuck around 1.5 million, though applications have dropped from a record high of 6.86 million reached at the end of March.

Though the layoffs reported by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas were down 57% from May, they jumped 306% compared to June last year. The job cuts explain why new filings for unemployment benefits have remained extraordinary high even as businesses have reopened after closing in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
""We are beginning to see the impact of the recession spreading to companies that were not directly impacted by the virus,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

Initial weekly claims for unemployment benefits have been stuck around 1.5 million, though applications have dropped from a historic 6.867 million scaled at the end of March. 
About 30.6 million people were collecting unemployment checks in the first week of June. 
According to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, layoffs totaled an all-time high of 1.238 million in the second quarter, up 257% from the January-March period.
It expected job cuts to remain elevated as rising cases of the respiratory illness across the country and unemployment undercut consumer and business spending. 
COVID-19 was cited as the reason for 1.011 million of the 1.585 million job cuts this year. About 9,581 layoffs so far this year were due to bankruptcy. 
Overall, the bulk of the job cuts have been at bars, restaurants, hotels, and amusement parks. Retailers and companies providing catering, linen, marketing, and administrative services have also laid off workers. 

In the auto sector, manufacturers, suppliers and dealers have shed workers. But government, healthcare, technology, aerospace and defense are hiring. So far this year, 1.836 million hiring plans have been announced, with 75,454 in June.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rebounded sharply in May and unemployment rose less than expected in June, data showed on Wednesday, signalling that an economic recovery from the impact of the coronavirus is gathering steam.
Retail sales rose by almost 14%, rebounding from a 6.5% drop in April, largely supported by online shopping as concerns about catching the disease kept many consumers away from stores.
Last month, the number of people out of work rose by 69,000, Labour Office figures showed - far less than the 120,000 forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Europe's largest economy has weathered COVID-19 better than most of its neighbours, helped by relatively soft lockdown measures that allowed some social and industrial activity to continue thoughout the peak months of the epidemic, as well as hefty rescue and stimulus packages.
The Ifo institute said on Wednesday the economy was likely to return to last year's level of output at the end of 2021. ""From now on, things are gradually improving again,"" it said.
The government hopes a cut in value-added tax rates from July 1 to the end of 2020 will give consumption a further boost, and it has also introduced a short-time work scheme that allows firms to put employees on shorter hours during a downturn to keep them on the payroll.
Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said this initiative was having a stabilising effect on the jobs market, which he said nevertheless remained under pressure from the pandemic.
Wednesday's figures meant that 2.943 million people were jobless in Germany last month, nudging the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate up to 6.4%.

Ifo said it expected the economy to have contracted 11.9% in the second quarter and forecast growth of 6.9% and 3.8% in the third and fourth quarters - translating into a contraction of 6.7% in 2020, Germany's deepest recession since World War Two.

WARSAW/PRAGUE(Reuters) - The downturn in central European manufacturing eased markedly in June as economies reopened after the coronavirus lockdown, surveys showed on Wednesday, but the sector was still some way from returning to growth.
Manufacturing output plunged as the pandemic brought many plants to a standstill in March and April. Restrictions started to be eased in May.
While economists say the worst has passed, central banks and governments in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic forecast gross domestic product will shrink by 3-8% in 2020.
""The beginning of the pandemic was difficult, it began with a lot of absences and a decline in export orders,"" said Ryszard Florek, chief executive of Polish window manufacturer Fakro.
""At the moment the situation is calming down. We have no declines in Poland, we are resuming export sales.""
IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing in Poland rose to 47.2 in June from 40.6 in May, while a PMI for the Czech Republic rose to 44.9 from 39.6.
Readings below 50.0 denote a contraction in activity.
Hungary's seasonally adjusted PMI  rose to 47.0 in June from a revised 40.7 in May, the Association of Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory Management, which compiles the survey, said.
The surveys mirrored the situation in main trading partner Germany. 
""It (Hungarian PMI) shows some improvement, however, in my view this ... is far from the V-shaped rebound story,"" said Peter Virovacz is a Senior Economist at ING in Budapest. 
""Maybe there is a silver lining in the improvement but overall we are far from out of the woods.""
A survey by Czech group J&T Banka found most firms, entrepreneurs and top managers it surveyed did not expect a speedy economic recovery and more than a third saw a rebound taking multiple years.
""The expectation of new orders remains very uncertain,"" said Bohuslav Cizek, director of economic affairs at the Czech Confederation of Industry.
""Some sectors had been directly affected by the restrictive measures. On the other hand, many companies will face overall lower demand in the following months.""

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.1 from 40.7 in May, unrevised from a preliminary reading and creeping back above the 50 line that signifies growth for the first time since February.
""Output edged higher and domestic demand firmed as lockdown restrictions loosened, factories restarted and staff returned to work,"" said Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""The planned loosening in COVID-19 restrictions on July 4 should aid further gains in coming months.""
The survey is designed only to show the magnitude of monthly changes in output across businesses. The return to a reading above 50 does not signify a recovery to normal levels of manufacturing output.
In June, the Bank of England said Britain's economy looked on course to have shrunk by around 20% in the first six months of 2020 -- a smaller decline than it had first feared, but still one of the biggest annual drops in 300 years.
Manufacturers are nevertheless looking forward to better days.
Optimism hit a 21-month high in June, Dobson said.

Over 10 million people have been infected by the virus globally and more than 500,000 have died, leading governments to impose lockdowns and force businesses to temporarily close and citizens to stay at home.
But with transmission rates falling in much of Europe, and economies opening up, IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) moved closer to the 50-mark separating growth from contraction in June. 
It registered 47.4 last month, up from May's 39.4 and comfortably ahead of an earlier flash reading of 46.9. An index measuring output jumped to 48.9 from 35.6.
""The final PMI numbers for June add further to signs that the euro zone factories are seeing a strong initial recovery as the economy lifts from COVID-19 lockdowns,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Expectations for the year ahead have also rebounded sharply as hopes grow that the economy will continue to find its feet again in the coming months.""
The future output index, which gauges optimism about the coming 12 months, bounced back into positive territory at 57.3 from May's 44.6.
However, all other indexes remained stubbornly below the breakeven level, suggesting any recovery might be slow and long.

Retail sales rose by 13.9% on the month in real terms after a downwardly revised drop of 6.5% in April, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. A Reuters forecast had predicted a 3.9% increase.
On the year, retail sales rose by 3.8% in real terms after a decrease of 6.4% in the previous month.
Fear of catching the coronavirus kept many consumers away from stores, which translated into a massive increase in online sales, the data showed.
Online sales rose by 28.7% in real terms while clothing and shoes sales fell by more than 22%.
A consumer sentiment survey published earlier this month showed that German consumers had become more eager to take out their wallets and more positive about their income prospects heading into July.

Nationwide said its measure of house prices fell by 0.1% compared with June of last year. 
In monthly terms, prices fell by 1.4%, not as steep as May's 1.7% fall, which was the biggest drop in more than 11 years.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to an annual rise of 1.0% and a monthly fall of 0.7%.
The government eased restrictions on the housing market in mid-May but data published by the Bank of England earlier this week showed the lowest number of mortgage approvals on record during that month.
Nationwide's chief economist, Robert Gardner, said a further easing of broader lockdown measures in the coming weeks was likely to lead to a slight pick-up in activity in the housing market, but the medium-term outlook remained highly uncertain.
""The raft of policies adopted to support the economy, including to protect businesses and jobs, to support peoples’ incomes and keep borrowing costs down, should set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes, and help limit long-term damage to the economy,"" he said.
Nationwide said on a seasonally adjusted basis, house prices in June were 3.2% lower than in April.
It said its sample sizes had remained sufficiently large to generate an accurate reading of price changes.
In London, house prices rose by an annual 2.1% over the second quarter and average prices in the capital were just 3% below all-time highs struck in early 2017. 

A Reuters poll of property market analysts published last week showed prices in London were expected to fall 5.0% this year before rising 2.0% next year and 4.3% in 2022.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia's factory pain showed signs of easing in June, as a rebound in China's activity offered some hope the region may have passed the worst of the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
But sluggish global demand and fears of a second wave of infections will tame any optimism on the outlook and keep pressure on policymakers to support their ailing economies.
A series of business surveys released on Wednesday showed broad improvements in manufacturing across Asia in June from the depths hit in April and May. Activity in some economies swung to growth while declines in other places slowed.
In China, factory activity grew at a faster clip in June after the world's second-largest economy lifted coronavirus lockdown measures, the Caixin/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed.
Manufacturing activity also expanded in Vietnam and Malaysia, pointing to a slow but steady recovery ahead.
India's manufacturing activity contracted for a third straight month in June but at a much slower pace, as both output and new orders shrank at softer rates.
Similarly, the export powerhouses of Japan and South Korea continued to see manufacturing activity decline, albeit at a softer pace.
""The chance of a V-shape recovery in the manufacturing sector appears slim at this stage,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""We're still awaiting signs of meaningful improvement in Japan's manufacturing sector, with the PMI for June failing to stage a substantial recovery.""
Globally, the pandemic has infected more than 10 million and killed more 500,000. A resurgence in new cases in several countries has prompted some governments to backpedal on plans to reopen their economies and fueled concerns the worst is still to come.
In its latest projections, the International Monetary Fund expects the global economy to shrink by 4.9% this year and rebound by just 5.4% next year.
China's Caixin/Markit PMI rose to 51.2 in June from 50.7 in May, marking the highest reading since December 2019. That followed a similarly upbeat reading from the Chinese government's own PMI on Tuesday.
Vietnam and Malaysia also saw their PMIs crawl back above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, a welcome sign for policymakers struggling to combat the pandemic's fallout.
""The host of PMI data release this morning offers some reassuring signs that the outlook for the crucial manufacturing sector continues to be on the mend,"" said Wellian Wiranto, an economist at OCBC Bank.
But analysts expect any recovery in the region to be slow.
While China's export orders shrank at a slower pace, its employment contraction worsened, the PMI showed, underscoring the fragile recovery.
""Overall manufacturing demand recovered at a fast clip, but overseas demand remained a drag,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
Japan's PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 40.1 in June, while South Korea's PMI ticked up to 43.4 - both remaining far below the rise-or-fall threshold of 50.
Separately, a Bank of Japan survey showed big manufacturers' confidence sinking to levels last seen during the 2009 global financial crisis, reinforcing expectations the country was sinking deeper into recession.

""If demand doesn't rebound fast enough, companies will have to shed jobs,"" said Shinichiro Kobayashi, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting. ""That will delay Japan's economic recovery, which could end up in a L-shape.""

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.2 last month, the fastest pace of growth since December, and up from May's 50.7. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 50.5.
China's economy is gradually emerging from a sharp 6.8% contraction in the first quarter, with much of the country reopened after weeks of disruptions early in the year due to strict lockdown measures.
But demand remained subdued, as many manufacturers are still struggling with reduced or cancelled overseas orders amid faltering global demand.
While some of China's trading partners are easing curbs and re-booting their economies, many are still grappling with the pandemic while a surge of worldwide infections over the past week has raised the risk of a deeper and prolonged global recession.
Consumers have also remained cautious amid job losses and fears of a fresh wave of infections in China as a cluster emerged in Beijing last month.
New export orders stayed firmly in contractionary territory, the survey showed, although the downturn eased from the sharp slump in May.
""Overall manufacturing demand recovered at a fast clip, but overseas demand remained a drag,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
The government has already rolled out a raft of easing steps this year, including reserve requirement cuts and targeted lending support and tax breaks for virus-hit firms. It has also ramped up local bond issuance in the hopes of spurring infrastructure growth.
Despite a pick-up in domestic orders, the uncertain outlook forced factories to cut payrolls for the sixth consecutive month, with the pace of job shedding accelerating. Avoiding mass unemployment is a top government priority, with a target to create over 9 million urban jobs this year.
""We should still pay attention to the pressure on employment. Top policymakers have repeatedly stressed the importance of expanding employment channels. For some time to come, increasing employment will remain an arduous task,"" Wang said.
Given the uncertain outlook, the government said in late May it was not setting an annual growth target, for the first time since 2002.
 
An official survey on Tuesday also showed China's factory activity grew at a quicker pace in June but smaller firms were still suffering and exporters struggled with shrinking orders, pointing to an uneven recovery.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' confidence sank in the second quarter to levels not seen since the 2009 global financial crisis, underscoring the damage the coronavirus pandemic inflicted on the export-reliant economy.
The Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" survey also showed big non-manufacturers' mood tanked to a decade low, as lockdown measures put in place through May forced businesses to shut and consumers to stay at home.
The dismal readings reinforce expectations Japan is headed for deep recession due to the fallout from the pandemic.
""Industries across the board seemed to have been hit hard by a sharp decline in demand, underscoring the extensive damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment hit -34 in June, worse than a median market forecast for -31 and the lowest level since June 2009. The 26-point drop from March was the second-fastest pace of decline on record.
The index measuring big non-manufacturers' sentiment fell 25 points to -17 in June, the worst reading since December 2009.
Big firms expect to increase capital expenditure by 3.2% in the year to March 2021, exceeding market estimates of a 2.1% gain but lower than the plans made three months ago.
""There's a chance big firms may revise down their spending plans,"" said Shinichiro Kobayashi, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting. ""The pace of any economic recovery will be slow.""
In a sign the gloom is affecting the jobs market, companies expect to slash new hires by 5.6% in fiscal 2021 from a year ago, which would be the first drop since 2010.
Among big firms, sentiment hit record lows for restaurants, hotels and machinery makers. But supermarkets, home centres and retailers saw conditions improve on demand for ""stay-at-home"" and teleworking goods, a BOJ official told a briefing.

Japan slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in January-March and is set to suffer its deepest postwar slump in the current quarter.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports slumped more than expected in June, extending the double-digit contraction into a third month, as the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown measures continued to dent global demand.
Outbound shipments fell 10.9% year-on-year in June, trade ministry data showed on Wednesday, much better than a 23.6% plunge in the previous month but worse than a 7.8% drop tipped in a Reuters survey.
Average exports per working day, excluding the calendar effect, fell 18.5%, compared with an 18.3% decline seen in May. There were two more working days in June from the comparable month of 2019.
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, is considered a bellwether for global trade.
Exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, jumped 9.5% from a year earlier, but those to the United States and the European Union continued to decline 8.3% and 17.0%, respectively.
""Exports could remain sluggish through the third quarter as demand from advanced nations isn't really taking off amid second wave fears,"" said Park Sang-hyun, economist at HI Investment & Securities.
""The recovery is taking place and I see it as W-shaped, as current momentum could run out once fiscal spending slows down later in the year,"" Park added.
Wednesday data also showed imports tumbled 11.4%, far slower than a 21.0% drop in May but missing a forecast of 9.6% fall. That resulted in a $3.67 billion trade surplus, improved from a $0.45 billion in May.

Given the country's high dependence on foreign trade - with exports making up 33% of 2019 nominal gross domestic product - many analysts downgraded their economic projections for South Korea this year, with the International Monetary Fund now seeing a 2.1% contraction.

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) ticked up to 43.4 in June from 41.3 in May, but remained far below the 50-mark threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a sixth month.
The headline index reflected slower rates of contraction in major sub-indexes such as output, new orders and export orders but business conditions remained extremely weak in historical terms due to a long-feared resurgence in coronavirus infections.
""While the output and new orders indices have risen from the bottoms seen in April, these increases have been marginal as many companies are operating well below capacity or simply observing no month-to-month improvement in production and new order volumes,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
Given the country's high dependence on foreign trade - with exports making up 33% of 2019 nominal gross domestic product - a growing number of analysts downgraded their economic projections for South Korea this year, with the International Monetary Fund now seeing a 2.1% contraction.
Businesses were seen cutting staffing levels for a 14th consecutive month in June and at a similar rate seen in May, in response to weak sales and lower operating requirements.
Expectations for manufacturing output over the next 12 months also remained pessimistic, given uncertainty in COVID-19 development and potentially weak recovery.
""Given the cyclical nature of South Korea's export-oriented economy, it appears the chances of a slow recovery from the COVID-19 economic shock are rising,"" Hayes said.

""Without a sustained pickup in demand, manufacturing output levels will likely remain subdued.""

Many export-reliant nations such as Japan are feeling the pain from a global trade contraction triggered by the pandemic, after government-imposed lockdowns disrupted supply chains and made consumers stay at home.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 40.1 from 38.4 in May and a preliminary 37.8 released last week.
""The chance of a V-shape recovery in the manufacturing sector appears slim at this stage,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""We're still awaiting signs of meaningful improvement in Japan's manufacturing sector, with the PMI for June failing to stage a substantial recovery.""
The headline index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a 14th month - the longest such stretch since a 16-month run through June 2009.
Manufacturers struggled with fragile demand capacity, keeping output, new orders and purchasing activity deeply into contraction territory, the survey showed.
Backlogs of work fell at a rate close to the previous month's over-a-decade record, while employment levels declined at a faster pace.
On a more positive note, the future output subindex moved into positive territory for the first time since February on expectations of a gradual economic recovery, IHS Markit said.

Ireland has reopened its economy more gradually than much of Europe with large parts of the services sector including hotels, restaurants, hairdressers and most pubs only resuming trading this week, almost completing a full exit from lockdown.
A number of firms reported that factories reopened in June, the AIB IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers'Index (PMI) survey found. That helped push the index up to 51.0 from 39.2 in May, back above the 50 mark denoting growth.
The record one-month gain was driven by a near doubling in the largest sub indices of new orders and output, with exports also rising at the fastest level since April 2019.
The main index hit a low of 36.0 in April and stood at 51.2 in February before Ireland reported its first coronavirus case on Feb. 29.
Flash sister surveys in June for neighbouring Britain and the euro zone as a whole showed similar rebounds to 50.1 and 46.9 respectively.
However higher production was not matched by a rise in Irish employment in June, with one in five firms cutting staff, albeit down from 29% in May and 41% in April, the survey showed.
Ireland, which in recent years has been Europe's fastest-growing economy, reported on Tuesday that 22.5% of its workforce were either temporarily or permanently unemployed at the end of June, down from a record 28.2% in April.
AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said the return to growth was a clear indication of improving economic conditions but that many of the indices remained weak relative to their long-run averages.
""Manufacturing conditions have not returned to normal. The collapse in orders in the March-May period means that backlogs continued to fall sharply, while inventories of finished goods shrunk further, with stocks of inputs also still in marked decline,"" he said in a statement.

The economic participation rate was 47.4% in May, national statistics agency INEGI said. The rate, which measures the percentage of the working-age population in the labor market, compares to 47.5% from the previous month and 60.2% in May 2019.
""The downward variation of 12 million economically active people compared to March was maintained, due to the temporary work suspension caused by the social distancing measures,"" INEGI said.
The statistics agency stressed that workers are not being paid during the work suspension, nor are they guaranteed to get their jobs back once lockdown measures are lifted.
The new data comes from INEGI's second ""occupation and employment"" telephone poll, a temporarily replacement for its regular face-to-face survey, which it suspended while social distancing measures are in place.
Mexico's economy has been hammered by the pandemic, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicting the country's gross domestic product could shrink by up to 10.5% this year, in what would be its biggest decline since the 1930s.

The number of Mexicans working in the informal sector has risen sharply to 22.6 million people, up 4.1 percentage points in May from April, INEGI said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in June as businesses reopened, strengthening views that the economic downturn was likely over, though rising COVID-19 infections threaten to derail the budding recovery.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday followed a sharp surge in hiring and consumer spending in May. The housing market and manufacturing have also improved.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Monday acknowledged the rebound in activity, saying the economy had ""entered an important new phase and (had) done so sooner than expected."" 
In remarks prepared for a congressional hearing on Tuesday, the U.S. central bank chief cautioned that the economic outlook ""is extraordinarily uncertain"" and would depend on ""our success in containing the virus."" 
The economy slipped into recession in February. Businesses have largely reopened after being shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Large parts of the country, including densely populated California, Texas and Florida have reported a surge in cases of the respiratory illness. Some states are scaling back or pausing business reopenings. 
""The long road to normalcy is miles and miles away and the journey is a hazardous one as already a second wave of the pandemic virus has made some states backtrack on their reopening plans,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 98.1 this month from 85.9 in May. Still, the confidence index remains 34.5 points below its pre-pandemic level.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 91.8 in June.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to a reading of 86.2 this month from 68.4 in May. 
The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions jumped to 106.0 from a reading of 97.6 in May.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher on the confidence data. The dollar was lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were marginally lower.
LABOR MARKET SENTIMENT IMPROVES
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, improved to a reading of -3 this month from -12.7 in May. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
It has dropped from as high as 38.3 in August last year. 
The pandemic has unleashed record unemployment, with 30.6 million people collecting unemployment checks in the first week of June. The closely followed employment report to be released on Thursday is expected to show 3 million jobs created in June on top of the 2.5 million added in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
That would still leave payrolls nearly 17 million below their pre-COVID-19 level. The jobless rate is forecast dipping to 12.3% from 13.3% in May.
The Conference Board survey showed the percentage of consumers expecting an increase in income in the short term climbed to 15.1% this month from 14.6% in May and the proportion anticipating a drop fell to 14.4% from 15.4%.
Manufacturing is also stabilizing with a separate report on Tuesday showing a steady pick-up in factory activity in the Midwest. The MNI Indicators' Chicago Business Barometer rose to a reading of 36.6 in June from 32.3 in May.
Activity in the second quarter, however, slipped 11.8 points to 34.8, the lowest level since Q1 2009.
""The data are signaling a much slower pace of contraction in manufacturing,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""However, new flare-ups in virus cases across states, if they are not contained, pose a downside risk to both activity and output.""

A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index increased 4.0% from a year ago in April after rising 3.9% in March.

Gross domestic product shrank by 11.6%, adding to the 7.5% decline in March, Statistics Canada said Tuesday in Ottawa. Economists had anticipated a 12% contraction.
With the historic decline fully anticipated, the focus now shifts to how quickly and to what extent the economy will recover. May looks to have seen a small rebound, with the agency’s flash estimate predicting a 3% increase.
That would leave economic output at about 16% below levels in February and policy makers have been warning that a full recovery remains a long way off.
Tuesday’s report showed the downturn in April was broad-based, with all 20 industrial sectors down. Services-producing sectors recording a 9.7% decline, led by retail trade and transportation. Goods-producing industries saw a 17% decline in output.

392,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",Anaemic euro zone inflation unexpectedly ticks up,"BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation unexpectedly rose in June but underlying price pressures dropped again, underscoring fears that consumer price growth will remain anaemic for years as the bloc recovers from the biggest recession in living memory. 
Annual inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 0.3% in June from a four-year low of 0.1% in May, beating forecasts for no change and supporting the European Central Bank's expectation that a negative reading may be avoided. 
Excluding volatile food and energy prices, a key measure watched by the ECB, inflation eased to 1.1% from 1.2% while an even narrower gauge, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco, fell to 0.8% from 0.9%, data from Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency showed on Tuesday.
The ECB targets inflation at 2% but has already missed this for seven years and expects to undershoot at least through 2022 as a coronavirus-induced recession raises unemployment, dampens consumption and depresses wage growth.
Tuesday's figure may still offer mild comfort to the ECB that the rapid decline in inflation, also fuelled by crashing oil prices, may be over, even if any rebound in price growth is still unlikely until next year.
Policymakers had hoped massive government wage subsidies which limited income losses for households plus super easy monetary policy would limit the damage to the economy and prop up confidence enough to prevent a dangerous deflationary spiral. 
But ECB projections suggest inflation could stay at or near zero for the rest of 2020 and only pick up in the second quarter of 2021. 
Energy prices were down 9.4% year on year in June, following an 11.9% plunge in May, while unprocessed food prices were 5.9% higher after a 6.7% increase in May. Inflation in services dropped to 1.2% from 1.3%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank by the most since 1979 in early 2020 as households slashed their spending, according to official data that included the first few days of the coronavirus lockdown.
Gross domestic product dropped by a quarterly 2.2% between January and March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
That was below the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a fall of 2.0%.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson will set out his plan to speed up the British economy's recovery later on Tuesday when he will promise to fast-track 5 billion pounds ($6.13 billion) of infrastructure investment.
Britain's economy may have contracted by 20% in the first half of 2020, the Bank of England said earlier this month as the full effects of the lockdown hammered most sectors in the April-June period. The BoE has said the slump in the economy this year could be the worst in three centuries.
Tuesday's figures - which build on previously released data for the first quarter - showed a surge in household saving as their spending collapsed by the largest amount, in cash terms, since records began in the 1950s.
""The lockdown of most businesses on March 23 meant that households were unable to spend even if they wanted to,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, adding that it will take the economy until 2022 to regain its pre-crisis level.
The household savings ratio shot up to 8.6% in the first quarter from 6.6% at the end of 2019.
The ONS has previously estimated that Britain's economy shrank by a record 20.4% in April from March but there have been some signs of recovery more recently.
The ONS also said Britain's current account deficit widened by more than expected in the first three months of 2020.
The balance of payments deficit - a long-standing concern for investors because it leaves Britain reliant on foreign inflows of cash - grew to 21.1 billion pounds ($25.9 billion) in the first quarter, compared with a median forecast of 15.4 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
Stripping out volatile movements of gold and other precious metals, the current account deficit narrowed slightly, the ONS said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at a stronger pace in June after the government lifted lockdowns and stepped up investment, but persistent weakness in export orders suggests the coronavirus crisis will remain a drag on the economy for some time.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) came in at 50.9 in June, compared with May's 50.6, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Tuesday, and was above the 50.4 forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. 
The 50-point mark separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis.
The uptick was underpinned by the quickening pace of expansion in production. The forward-looking total new orders gauge also brightened, rising to 51.4 from May's 50.9, suggesting domestic demand is picking up as industries from non-ferrous metals to general equipment and electrical machinery all showed an improvement. 
But export orders continued to contract, albeit at a slower pace, with a sub-index standing at 42.6 compared to 35.3 in May, well below the 50-point mark.
""Despite the strong recovery between March and mid-June, we believe a full economic recovery remains distant. In our view, it is too early for Beijing to reverse its easing stance,"" Nomura analysts wrote in a note to clients.
In a statement, NBS official Zhao Qinghe underscored the prevailing uncertainty about the outlook, noting that small firms in China are suffering more than their larger peers.
Indeed, despite a flurry of government measures to support smaller companies, the PMI survey showed activity in these firms contracting last month.
Shanghai prime machinery (HK:2345), a Chinese manufacturer of fasteners that has been forced to close a factory in Germany this year due to the pandemic, said on Monday it expects to record a net loss of up to 40 million yuan in the first half of 2020, compared to a net profit of 114.7 million yuan in year-ago period.
""The divergence of the domestic recovery and foreign orders contraction highlights that the Chinese economy remains affected by the global situation for the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ING said in a note. 
DOWNWARD PRESSURE
Beijing has stepped up support measures this year to revive the economy, which contracted sharply in the first quarter.
High frequency Chinese data tracked by Nomura showed a flurry of better-than-expected indicators recently, while higher spending - particularly in infrastructure - was expected to boost economic activity for the rest of this year.
A separate official survey on China's services sector showed activity expanded at a faster clip in June. The non-manufacturing PMI rose to 54.4, from 53.6 in May, suggesting steadily stabilising business confidence. 
Still, construction activity, a key driver of growth, slowed from the previous month, highlighting the uneven nature of the recovery both in the sector and the overall economy. 
Some analysts have warned against being overly optimistic about the outlook given uncertainties around the COVID-19 pandemic.
While the improvement this month might be due to easing in restrictions across some countries, export demand has remained weak overall with infections steadily rising across the world.
Some fear a worldwide recession might turn out to be more pronounced than expected in the event a second wave of coronavirus cases force many countries to reimpose strict lockdowns.
Adding to the worries domestically is a cluster found earlier this month in a food market in Beijing, underscoring the ever present economic threat posed by the virus.
Despite stronger demand, factories reduced headcount for the second time in June since they reopened, with the survey's sub-index falling to 49.1 from 49.4 in May. 
""The contrast between rising new orders and more job-shedding shows companies were still cautious about demand recovering in the short term,"" Huatai securities macro analyst Yang Chang said.

Investing.com – China’s National Bureau of Statistics reported a better-than-expected manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) of 50.9 on Tuesday.
A PMI reading above 50 indicates economic growth.
The figure was higher than the 50.4 number predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com as well as the previous month’s PMI of 50.6. The Bureau also reported a non-manufacturing PMI of 54.4, which was higher than May’s 53.6 and a composite PMI of 54.2, above May’s 53.4.
The data indicated that manufacturing is still leading Chinese economic recovery from the COVID-19 virus, Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY), told Bloomberg. But he added, “China’s GDP growth is very likely to turn positive in the second quarter. However, the job data remain a concern as both job indices are below 50, suggesting that the demand recovery still lags behind.""
Data from the China Logistics Information Center indicated almost 55% of firms were seeing inadequate demand, the fourth consecutive month of the same message from over half the firms surveyed. The Bureau also warned in its statement that a lack of orders was starting to contract the small firms’ positions, while medium-sized firms rose above 50 and larger companies improved further. More small firms reported a lack of orders compared to larger companies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes rebounded by the most on record in May, suggesting the housing market was starting to turn around after being hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic along with the rest of the economy.
Other data on Monday showed an improvement in manufacturing activity in Texas in June after three months of record or near-record declines in output. But surging infections of the respiratory illness in many regions, including the densely populated Texas, Florida and California, pose a risk to the nascent recovery. The economy fell into recession in February.
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, surged 44.3%, the largest gain since the series started in 2001. Still, contracts remain 10.6% below their level in February before businesses were shuttered in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus, almost grounding the economy to a halt. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, rebounding 18.9% in May. Pending home sales fell 5.1% from a year ago. 
Home resales tumbled to a more than 9-1/2-year low in May. Economists believe the housing market could emerge more quickly from the recession, which started in February, thanks to historic low interest rates. 
Applications for home loans are near an 11-year high and building permits rebounded sharply in May as did new home sales. But record unemployment, with 30.6 million collecting unemployment checks in the first week of June, is a challenge.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after a sharp selloff last week. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
GREEN SHOOTS
In May, pending home contracts soared 43.3% in the populous South. They jumped 56.2% in the West and increased 44.4% in the Northeast. Contracts rose 37.2% in the Midwest.
There were also signs of green shoots in manufacturing. In a separate report on Monday, the Dallas Federal Reserve said its Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, increased to a reading of 13.6 this month from -28.0 in May.
It said other measures of manufacturing activity also pointed to a rebound in growth this month, with the new orders index racing 34 points to 2.9, its first positive reading in four months. Nearly a third of manufacturers reported an increase in orders. Measures of capacity utilization and shipments also returned to positive territory in June.
But manufacturers' views of broader business conditions were mixed. The general business activity index surged 43 points but stayed negative at -6.1. The outlook index pulled back into positive territory, rising to a reading of 2.7 from -34.6 in May. About 29% of manufacturers said the outlook had improved, up from 12% last month. 
Factory employment measures remained weak. The employment index rose 10 points to a reading of -1.5, with 15% of firms reporting hiring, while 17% said they had laid off workers. The hours worked index rose to -4.3 from -22.8 in May.

Though manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, a gauge of prices for finished goods remained negative for the sixth straight month. The wages and benefits index returned to positive territory after two negative readings.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian industrial producer prices rose 1.2% in May on higher prices for meat, fish and dairy products, Statistics Canada said on Monday, as supply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and increased demand boosted meat prices.
The gain in producer prices followed four months of consecutive decreases and matched a flash estimate released by the statistical agency earlier this month.
Statscan said the May increase was driven by higher prices for meat, fish and dairy products as well as gains in energy and petroleum products. Of the 21 major commodity groups monitored by the agency, six rose, 11 fell, and four were unchanged.
Meat product prices rose 13.3%, led by fresh and frozen pork, which increased a record 31.3% as disruptions in the supply chain from the coronavirus pandemic and higher demand for meat products contributed to the gain.
Earlier this month, Statcan had said it expected meat prices would rise following outbreaks of COVID-19 in Canadian and U.S. meat plants that forced operations to shut down or reduce capacity.
Meanwhile, prices for energy and petroleum products rose by 4.6%.
In a separate release, the national statistical agency said Canadian building permits rose 20.2%, the largest percentage increase since March 2009, as some provinces eased constraints imposed on the construction industry due to the coronavirus pandemic.
However, the May figure was still 20.4% below the peak seen in January 2020, Statscan said.
The value of residential permits was up in six provinces, rising 18.7%, with most of the gains due to a jump in the value of permits in single-family homes, which rose 37.5%. Meanwhile, commercial permits jumped 20.8%

State-level releases showed steep increases for hair and cosmetic services, as well as at restaurants and cafes -- businesses still slapped with restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Economists and policy makers across Europe have pondered for months how growth and inflation will be impacted by shutdowns of parts of the economy and the slow reopening.
European Central Bank officials, who aim for euro-area price growth of just below 2%, have been adamant that the crisis will likely damp demand and weigh down inflation. At the same time, some economists have pointed to supply-chain disruptions as possible triggers for sudden spikes.
In Germany, the statistics office said food-price inflation remained above 4% in June, while price growth in services stood at 1.4%. Euro-area data are due on Tuesday.

Overall sentiment rose to 75.7 points in June from 67.5 in May, still short of market expectations of 80.0 and well below the average of 100 since 2000.
The index crashed in April to its lowest level since measurements started in 1985 as lockdowns closed large sectors of the economy.
May's pick-up was due to rises in sentiment in industry and among consumers. June's further increase was across all sectors, the sharpest rebounds being for retail trade and services. The latter generates about two-thirds of euro zone GDP.
Expectations about production, future demand or plans to make purchases were key parts of the improvement. All sectors also viewed employment plans more favourably, the indicator recovering between 40 and 60% of the March and April losses.
The largest euro area economies - France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain - also all registered increased confidence.
Selling price expectations picked up markedly in industry, services and retail. By contrast, consumer price expectations plummeted to an extent last seen in the financial crisis.

408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",Europe Slowly Picks Up Pieces After Virus Shattered Economy,"(Bloomberg) --
Economic confidence is slowly returning to the euro area where companies from manufacturers to retailers are picking up the pieces after devastating coronavirus lockdowns.
Sentiment in a European Commission survey rose in June, though less than economists had forecasts, and it remains well below the levels seen at the start of the year. The report -- like similar ones published recently -- indicates that full recovery is still a long way off.
The 19-nation euro region is set to shrink more than 8% this year, and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that the pandemic will change parts of the economy permanently.
So far, confidence has clawed back about 30% of the combined losses of March and April, when far-reaching restrictions brought public life to a near standstill. While those limitations are now gradually being lifted, the continued spread of the disease in parts of Europe, as well as in the Americas, serves as a cautious reminder how quickly the situation can deteriorate again.
Hundreds of thousands of workers are already facing unemployment, with companies from  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY) -- Germany’s severely battered airline that just secured a government bailout -- to plane maker Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) preparing to cut jobs.
The commission report showed that employment expectations in the euro area have improved from their lows, but for some sectors they remain as much as 60% below pre-virus level.
Still, consumer confidence rose in June as households expect the general economic situation to improve. Sentiment measures increased across all industries and major euro-area economies.
The improvements come on the back of massive stimulus campaigns. The ECB is buying 1.35 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion) worth of debt, and governments have pledged hundreds of billions of euros in support. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition agreed this month on a sweeping 130 billion-euro plan, and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier has flagged a package of measures aimed at exporters for the coming week.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“If any European country is likely to see a V-shaped recovery, it’s Germany. Getting the virus under control caused less disruption than elsewhere, fiscal support is substantial and activity is picking up again.”

The number of mortgage approvals fell to 9,273 - the lowest since comparable records began in October 1997 - from 15,851 in April which was already sharply lower than in previous months.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected approvals to rise to 25,000 in May. Before the coronavirus pandemic and the government's closure of the housing market - which was only lifted in mid-May in England - they were running at more than 70,000 a month.
The data also showed a further net repayment of consumer credit of 4.6 billion pounds ($5.7 billion) in May as people remained largely stuck at home and spent less, although the pace of the repayment slowed from April.
The BoE reported a further big rise in the amount of money households and companies hold in their bank accounts which increased by 52.0 billion, compared with increases of about 67 billion and 38 billion pounds in March and April.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports likely shrunk for a fourth month but at a slower pace in June due to easing global virus lockdowns and more working days, yet a second wave of infection and Sino-U.S. tension were seen clouding near-term recovery, a poll showed on Monday.
Overseas sales were expected to decline 7.8% year-on-year, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 12 economists. That compared with a 23.6% plunge in May and a 7.5% fall in preliminary data for the first 20 days of the month.
""The rate of contraction should have narrowed to a single-digit due to resumption of economic activities in some parts of the world and more working days in the month,"" said Park Sung-woo, economist at DB Financial Investment.
Many economists see the export decline slowing further from the third quarter given signs of recovery in major economies, but major downside risks still lie ahead. 
""With the second-wave infection, unemployment increase, and China-U.S. tensions clouding the near-term global outlook, the recovery path in exports is expected to be U-shaped in the second half of 2020,"" said DBS economist Ma Tieying.
The poll also forecast that the country's imports to tumble 9.6% year-on-year in June, much slower than a 21.0% plunge in the previous month.
Given the country's high dependence on foreign trade - with exports and imports taking up 63.7% of 2019 nominal GDP - a growing number of analysts downgraded their economic projection for South Korea this year, with the International Monetary Fund now seeing a 2.1% contraction.
In the same poll, economists saw industrial output in May slipping a seasonally adjusted 1.4% from a month earlier, a smaller decline than the 6.0% of April. Industrial output data trail trade and some other data by a month.

Eleven economists also estimated consumer prices would slide a median 0.1% in June from a year earlier, compared with a 0.3% fall a month earlier.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Retail sales in Japan tumbled at a double-digit pace for the second straight month in May as the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown measures delivered a heavy blow to consumer confidence and economic recovery prospects.
The sustained downturn in demand raises risks that the world's third-largest economy could remain mired in recession longer than expected and a revival may be more sluggish.
Retail sales fell 12.3% in May from a year earlier, pulled down by a slump in spending on big ticket items such as cars as well as clothing and general merchandise, trade ministry data showed on Monday.
The decline followed a 13.9% drop in April, which was the biggest fall since March 1998, and was worse than a 11.6% fall forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
Policymakers are hoping a rebound in private spending, which accounts for more than half of the economy, will help support growth as uncertainty over the global demand outlook threatens to delay a recovery.
Compared to a month earlier, retail sales in May saw their first rise in three months, increasing a seasonally adjusted 2.1% following a 9.9% drop in April.
""Although consumption has picked up a little, there was a strong sense of caution towards the infection and customers were slow to come back,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
Some analysts say cash payouts of 100,000 yen ($933) per citizen in response to the pandemic could fuel a bout of ""revenge spending"" following the lifting of a state of emergency in May and as more people get used to social distancing measures, which remain in place in crowded areas.
Midori, a 29-year-old worker at an electric instrument maker who declined to give her last name, said only one of her friends has received the government payout so far.
""I think consumption will decline compared to before the coronavirus outbreak,"" she said on Saturday while going shopping in Yokohama, adding that she plans to invest part of the cash handout and spend the rest on daily life essentials.
Shinkin's Tsunoda worries that a weakening economy and ""strong sense of uncertainty about the future"" could lead to cuts in year-end bonus payouts and employment adjustments by firms.

The economy is forecast to contract by more than 20% on an annualised basis this quarter, marking the third straight quarter of decline, with business activity hit by lockdown measures from April through late May.

China's national bureau of statistics said profits at China's industrial firms in May rose 6% year-on-year to 582.3 billion yuan ($82.28 billion), according to a statement on Sunday.
The rebound followed a 4.3% fall in April, and is its sharpest monthly gain since March 2019. 
Economic activity in China is clearly improving after the lifting of tough virus containment measures that led to weeks of near paralysis. But the recovery has been uneven and demand at home and abroad remains sluggish amid concerns of a second wave of infections and a global recession. 
Despite May's earnings growth, ""market demand remains relatively weak amid the epidemic, and sustainability of the profit recovery deserves further observation,"" Zhu Hong, senior statistician at the statistics bureau said in the statement.
Earnings for Chinese factories were hit by the sharpest factory-gate price drop in more than four years recorded in May, while exports slipped again, erasing a transient gain in April.
Futures prices for steel, which have surged this year on a government push for more infrastructure projects, fell last week as rising steel production and lean demand from downstream users stoked worries about oversupply. 
For the first five months of 2020, industrial firms' profits fell 19.3% from the same period last year to 1.84 trillion yuan.
May's profit growth was aided by significant profit recoveries in key industries including oil refinery, power, chemicals and steel.
For example, the oil refinery sector recorded a profit of 11.6 billion yuan in May, up 8.9% year-on-year, swinging from a loss of 21.8 billion yuan the previous month. Power sector profits grew 10.9% in May, compared with a decline of 15.7% in April. 
Zhu also attributed May's profit growth to easing cost pressures, improving profit margins, positive impact from policy stimulus and much higher investment returns. 
Earnings at China's state-controlled industrial firms were down 39.3% on an annual basis for January-May, versus a 46.0% fall in the first four months, the statistics bureau data showed. 
Private sector profits fell 11% in the first five months, narrowing from January-April's 17.2% slump.
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.6% on year at end-May, compared with a 6.2% increase as of end-April.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumers in southern U.S. states where COVID-19 infections spiked to record levels after authorities rushed to reopen businesses were less optimistic about economic conditions in June than residents in areas that proceeded more cautiously and followed the advice of health experts. 
The University of Michigan said on Friday its measure of consumer sentiment rose only 0.5 point among residents in the South in June. Southern states, including Texas, South Carolina and Florida, which had reopened by mid-May, are reporting a surge in cases of the respiratory illness. 
Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Friday ordered bars to close down again and restaurants to scale back service.
""While most consumers believe that economic conditions could hardly worsen from the recent shutdown of the national economy, prospective growth in the economy is more closely tied to progress against the coronavirus,"" said Richard Curtin, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers chief economist.
""The early reopening of the economy has undoubtedly restored jobs and incomes, but it has come at the probable cost of an uptick in the spread of the virus."" 
In the West, where coronavirus infections have also jumped despite early adoption of stringent measures to slow the spread of the disease, consumer sentiment increased 3.3 points in June. 
In contrast, sentiment among residents in the Northeast soared by a record 19.1 points this month. State and local governments in the Northeast are gradually reopening their economies while monitoring COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. 
Curtin attributed the surge in confidence to ""residents apparently expecting the later and more gradual reopening to produce at worst a negligible increase in infections."" 
He predicted that the resurgence of the virus would undercut consumer demand in the southern and western regions and might even temper spending in the Northeast. 

The survey also found that consumers' confidence in government economic policies dropped in June to its lowest since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer spending rebounds; falling income, surging COVID-19 cases loom","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rebounded by the most on record in May, but the gains are not likely to be sustainable, with income dropping and expected to decline further as millions lose their unemployment checks starting next month. 
The surge in spending reported by the Commerce Department on Friday is also under threat from a jump in coronavirus cases in many parts of the country, including densely populated California, Texas and Florida. The rising COVID-19 infections chipped at consumer sentiment in the second half of June. Confidence in government economic policies dropped in June to the lowest level since President Donald Trump entered the White House.
The economy has been showing signs of turning around after tough measures to slow the spread of the respiratory illness pushed it into recession in February. Hiring, homebuilding permits, industrial output and orders for manufactured goods rebounded in May, recouping some of their historic losses. 
""There are still huge pitfalls ahead for the economy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 8.2% last month. That was largest increase since the government started tracking the series in 1959. Consumer spending tumbled by a historic 12.6% in April. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast spending rising 9.0% in May. Spending was boosted by the reopening of many businesses after being shuttered in mid-March. 
Consumers stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and recreational goods. They also boosted spending on healthcare, and at restaurants, hotels and motels. 
But personal income dropped 4.2%, the most since January 2013, after surging by a record 10.8% in April when the government handed out one-time $1,200 checks to millions of people and boosted unemployment benefits to cushion against the COVID-19 hardship. The payments are part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion. 
In a separate survey on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index dipped to a reading of 78.1 from 78.9 in the middle of June. Though sentiment rose from May, consumers in the regions with record rises in coronavirus cases were less upbeat relative to Northeast residents, which could weigh on the overall mood in the months ahead.
Stocks on Wall Street fell, pressured by the rising virus infections and the Federal Reserve's move to cap big bank dividend payments and bar share repurchases until at least the fourth quarter. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
INFLATION WEAK
Income in May was weighed down by a decrease in government welfare payments. The government will stop paying an additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits on July 31. Economists estimate about 26 million people, two-thirds of whom do not qualify for the regular 26-week state unemployment insurance benefits, would be left without income. 
About 30.6 million people, roughly a fifth of the labor force, were collecting unemployment checks in the first week of June. Government transfers to households rose at an annualized $1.1 trillion rate compared to $3 trillion in April. 
Wages rebounded 2.7% after dropping 7.6% in April. But gains could fizzle amid record unemployment and raging COVID-19 infections. Economists said the plunge in income underscored the need for additional government stimulus to avoid a so-called fiscal cliff on July 31.
""It is clear that the major force in keeping things from falling apart is the enhanced unemployment compensation,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Without action, income could crater in August and spending will follow.""
Consumer spending in May was funded from savings, which decreased by $1.9 trillion. The saving rate dropped to a still-high 23.2% from a record 32.2% in April. 
Historically high savings could support spending. Economists, however, caution that heightened uncertainty could prompt consumers to hunker down and conserve their income.
Inflation remained weak in May, with food prices moderating and the cost of energy goods and services declining for a fifth straight month. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components edged up 0.1% after falling 0.4% in April. 
In the 12 months through May, the so-called core PCE price index rose 1.0%, matching April's gain. The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target.
When adjusted for inflation consumer spending surged a record 8.1% in May after tumbling 12.2% in April. Still the so-called real consumer spending remained 11.2% below its pre-pandemic level, keeping intact economists' expectations for the sharpest plunge in consumer spending and gross domestic product in the second quarter since the Great Depression.

Economists expect GDP could shrink at as much as a 46% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy contracted at a 5% pace in the January-March quarter, the deepest downturn since the 2007-09 Great Recession.

Adjusted for seasonal swings, Latin America's second-biggest economy contracted 17.3% from March, the biggest fall since modern data began being published in early 1993, according to figures put out by national statistics agency INEGI.
The decline, however, was not as sharp as the 19.4% drop forecast by a Reuters poll of economists.
In unadjusted terms, the economy shrank 19.9% in April compared with a year earlier, the figures showed.
A breakdown of the data showed that primary activities such as farming, fishing and mining shrank 6.4% from March. Secondary activities, which include manufacturing, plummeted 25.1% and tertiary activities, which cover the service sector, fell 14.4%.
Auto production almost ground to a halt in April, falling by 98.8% on the year, and the country's main industry group has forecast output in the sector could drop by nearly a third in 2020.

The government hopes the economy fared slightly better in May, when authorities gradually began to permit sectors such as carmaking, mining and construction to start up again.

418,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",Trump Administration to Release PPP Data by End of Next Week,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration plans to publicly release details about coronavirus relief loans for small businesses by the end of next week after reversing its position on withholding the data.
Company names and other details about Paycheck Protection Program loans of $150,000 and more, plus certain details about smaller loans without information identifying the firms, will be posted on the Small Business Administration’s website, according to a Treasury Department official speaking on condition of anonymity.
Congressional committees that have been demanding the information will get access to the full data with the understanding that personally identifiable and sensitive business information will be treated as confidential, according to letters sent to the House Ways and Means Committee and Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza and released by the SBA.
The full data will also be provided to the Government Accountability Office, the letters to the committee said. The GAO had said that the SBA wasn’t cooperating with its request for loan details.
Following a backlash from refusing to provide the names of companies that received PPP loans, the Trump administration announced June 19 that company names, addresses, demographic data and other information for loans of more than $150,000 would be disclosed in five ranges -- starting with $150,000 to $350,000, and going up to between $5 million and $10 million.
Details of smaller loans including zip code, industry, business type, and various demographic categories would be released without the company names to protect confidential or proprietary information because the loan amounts are calculated using a firm’s payroll, the agencies said.
But critics said that wasn’t not good enough because loans of less than $150,000 accounted for 86% of the total number approved as of June 20, and that detail was needed to determine whether the PPP was serving businesses that need help and how taxpayer dollars were spent. Eleven news organizations, including Bloomberg News, also sued to make details of the loan recipients public.
Lawmakers demanded the disclosure of PPP loan details after Mnuchin said at a Senate committee hearing on June 10 that the names of companies that received forgivable loans and the amounts were proprietary or confidential. The administration had previously said the details would be disclosed, and the PPP application said such data would “automatically” be released.
The loans of as much as $10 million can become grants if the proceeds are spent mostly on payroll. As of Thursday night, more than 4.7 million loans totaling $517.1 billion had been approved, according to SBA. The program ends Tuesday, when SBA will stop accepting new applications.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 02:46PM ET</span>","U.S. labor market, economy struggle despite reopening of businesses","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits fell moderately last week as a second wave of layoffs partially offset hiring by businesses reopening, suggesting the labor market could take years to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Other data on Thursday reinforced expectations the economy would contract in the second quarter at its deepest pace since the Great Depression. Though orders for key capital goods rebounded in May, the increase recouped only a fraction of the prior declines. The goods trade deficit widened sharply last month as the respiratory illness disrupted trade further.
""All is not well in this economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""While it counts as good news that businesses are ordering more equipment in May as the states reopened, the second wave of the pandemic may keep companies cautious in the months ahead when it comes to making new investments in the country's future.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 60,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.48 million for the week ended June 20, the Labor Department said. There was a jump in claims in California, which together with Texas and Florida, has seen a surge in novel coronavirus cases. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.3 million applications in the latest week. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in late March, but they remain more than double their peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. The report, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed 30.6 million people were receiving unemployment checks in the first week of June, about a fifth of the labor force.
Businesses in many states reopened more than a month ago after shuttering in mid-March to try to slow the spread of COVID-19. Companies are hiring, but others are cutting jobs at nearly the same pace. 
The economy slipped into recession in February. From manufacturing to the transportation, retail and leisure and hospitality industries, companies are restructuring to adapt to a vastly changed landscape, leading to layoffs and bankruptcies.
State and local governments, whose budgets have been squeezed by the COVID-19 fight, are also cutting jobs.
High unemployment is undercutting demand, with ripple effects on business investment, which contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since mid-2009. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business spending plans, increased 2.3% in May after dropping 6.5% in April. These so-called core capital goods orders are 5.6% below pre-pandemic levels.
The surge in coronavirus infections threatens the nascent improvement in business investment. Energy companies slammed the brakes on returning staff to their Houston offices as COVID-19 cases soared and top hospitals warned they could soon run out of beds for the most severely ill patients.
The pandemic is upending the flow of goods. In another report, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit jumped 5.1% to $74.3 billion in May. Exports tumbled 5.8% while imports decreased 1.2%. With imports declining again, retailers and wholesalers drew down inventories. 
Economists expect GDP could shrink at as much as a 46% annualized rate in the second quarter. The economy contracted at a 5% pace in the January-March quarter, the deepest downturn since the Great Recession.
Major U.S. stock indexes were trading slightly higher, led by gains in shares of financial and energy companies. The dollar (DXY) was higher versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
STALLED PROGRESS 
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 767,000 to 19.522 million in the week ending June 13. These so-called continued claims, reported with a one-week lag, are down from a record 24.912 million in early May. 
Economists credit the drop to the government's Paycheck Protection Program, which gives businesses loans that can be forgiven if used for wages.
The continuing claims data covered the week that the government surveyed households for June's unemployment rate. 
The jobless rate has been biased down since March by people incorrectly misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Without this problem, which the Labor Department is working to correct, the unemployment rate would have been 16.3% in May instead of 13.3% and would have peaked at about 19.7% in April. 
The government has expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits to include the self-employed and independent contractors who have been affected by the pandemic, including through lost employment, reduced hours and wages. 
These claims are not included in the regular state unemployment insurance, understating the magnitude of labor market distress. About 33 million people are currently claiming benefits under all programs.

""These claims foreshadow a June jobs report that may fail to meet the high expectations set by the May report,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York.

""Across the private sector, alongside the many organisations delaying a decision on their annual pay review, the number reverting to a pay freeze is increasing,"" XpertHR pay and benefits editor Sheila Attwood said.
""With the potential for redundancies looming, frozen or reduced pay is likely to be used as a way to minimise the number of job losses.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rebounded more than expected in May, but recouped only a portion of the prior two months' declines, suggesting business investment could lag the broader economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 2.3% last month as demand rose across the board, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders dropped 6.5% in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders advancing 1.0% in May. Core capital goods orders fell 2.5% on a year-on-year basis in May. 
Shipments of core capital goods rose 1.8% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Core capital goods shipments declined 6.2% in April.
The economy is showing tentative signs of improvement as businesses reopen after being shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of the respiratory illness. 
Retail sales, building permits and new home sales rebounded strongly in May. But weak demand, rising COVID-19 infections supply chain disruptions, which are hampering business investment, pose a risk to the economic recovery.
Economists expect business spending to contract in the second quarter, the fifth straight quarterly decline. The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product plunging at a record 45.5% annualized rate in the April-June quarter. The economy contracted at a 5.0% rate in the first quarter, the sharpest decline since the 2007-09 recession.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, surged 15.8% in May after tumbling 18.1% in April. The rise in orders is broadly in line with improvements in regional manufacturing, where activity pulled off record lows in June.
Demand for transportation equipment jumped 80.7% after plunging 48.6% in April. Boeing (N:BA) reported nine aircraft orders in May after receiving none in April, according to information posted on its website. 
Boeing been hurt by the fallout from two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which led to the grounding of its best-selling 737 MAX plane since March 2019.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 27.5% last month.

Goods exports plummeted 5.8% in May from the prior month to $90.1 billion, the lowest since August 2009, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday. Imports decreased 1.2% to $164.4 billion.
The data indicate the U.S. economy is still struggling to turn around after the business lockdowns and slowdown in consumer spending stemming from the coronavirus, even as more states begin to reopen and Americans head back to work. Analysts typically look to these trade numbers to adjust estimates for economic growth during the quarter.
The goods-trade deficit widened to $74.3 billion, the biggest since June last year, from a revised $70.7 billion a month earlier. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a $68.2 billion gap.
The International Monetary Fund this week downgraded an already-dour outlook for global trade this year, forecasting an 11.9% drop in goods and services trade.
The report also showed retail inventories fell 6.1% from the prior month. Wholesale inventories dropped 1.2%.

423,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",Durable Goods Orders in U.S. Surge by Most Since July 2014,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. orders for durable goods jumped in May by the most in nearly six years as nationwide reopenings rekindled demand for a broad range of merchandise and equipment.
Bookings for durable goods -- or goods meant to last at least three years -- surged 15.8%, the most since July 2014, after a revised 18.1% decline in April, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. That compared with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists for a 10.5% increase. Core capital goods orders, a category that excludes aircraft and military hardware, increased 2.3%, more than twice the median projection.
The rebound in orders reflects the beginning of the manufacturing sector’s gradual road to recovery after pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and lockdowns battered the industry and restrained sales. Even so, orders valued at $194.4 billion in May remain far short of where they were just three months earlier, suggesting the path to recovery will be a long one.
Shipments of core capital goods, a figure economists use to calculate gross domestic product, climbed 1.8% in May. GDP in the second quarter is forecast to post its steepest annualized decline in records dating back to the 1940s. In the first quarter, GDP shrank an annualized 5%, the government’s third estimate showed Thursday.
Transportation equipment orders jumped nearly 81% in May, including a 27.5% increase in motor vehicles and parts. The value of commercial aircraft bookings rose to $3.1 billion after a decline of $8.6 billion, which reflected order cancellations. Nondefense capital goods orders including aircraft rose 27.1% in May.
Excluding transportation, durable goods orders increased 4% after falling 8.2%.
A separate measure of manufacturing activity, out Tuesday, showed the sector is on the mend. IHS Markit’s manufacturing gauge rose in June to the highest level since February but remained in contraction.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits crept down to 1.48 million in the week ending June 20, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday, underlining the view that the labor market faces a prolonged and difficult recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The number was higher than forecasts for 1.30 million and was down only slightly from 1.54 million in the prior week.
Claims have pulled back from a record 6.86 million in late March, but the pace of decline has slowed. Companies are hiring, but others are cutting jobs at nearly the same pace. The economy slipped into recession in February.
A surge in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the U.S., linked to the reopening of businesses, is also clouding the economic outlook.
""There were some businesses that tried to maintain their workforce, waiting to see what would happen as businesses reopened,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Even as the economy is picking up they are not seeing a lot of demand and are deciding that they don't need that many workers.""
Continuing claims, which show the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, came in slightly below expectations at 19.52 million in the week ended June 13, down just slightly from 20.28 million a week earlier, but the first time they have been below 20 million since April.
Continuing claims figures are reported with a one-week delay but are considered offering a better view of the labor market. Continuing claims initially eased from a record high of 24.91 million in early May but appear to have stalled.

426,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>",UK retailers gloomy before June's lockdown easing,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers remained gloomy in the run-up to a relaxation of coronavirus lockdown rules earlier this month which allowed non-essential stores to reopen to the public for the first time since March.
The Confederation of British Industry said 62% of the retail chains it surveyed between May 27 and June 12 feared weak consumer demand would hamper recovery from the slump in sales of most items other than food and drink.
""Despite retailers working flat out to make sure they are safe and ready to open their doors, outside the grocery sector most retailers expect sales to be far below where they were this time last year,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said. 
Staff absence due to ongoing school closures was also a problem for most firms, the survey showed.
The CBI's headline retail sales barometer rose to -37 in June from -50 in May, slightly short of economists' average expectation in a Reuters poll and well beneath its level at the start of the year. Expected sales for July are worse.
Official data for May showed retail sales volumes jumped by 12% after tumbling in April, but were still around 10% lower than a year earlier.
Since June 15 non-essential stores have been able to reopen to the public, but they must still comply with social distancing rules which limit the number of shoppers. Some stores have their own restrictions on customers touching goods or trying on clothes to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the CBI data did not always track official figures closely, and that there could be a temporary recovery as shoppers made larger purchases they had delayed during the lockdown.

But he was less confident about later in the year - when government job support schemes are due to end - and predicted sales would be 5% down on pre-coronavirus levels in the final three months of 2020.

Companies signed up for $6.7 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $9.1 billion a year earlier. Borrowings fell 18% from the previous month.
""The downturn in the economy precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis is responsible for new business softening in the equipment finance space during the month of May,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said.
This economic downturn is particularly evident in market segments serving customers in the construction, hotel, tourism, leisure and food service industries, he added.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 68.1% in May, down from 71.7% in April.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, reported monthly confidence index of 45.8 in June, up from 25.8 in May.
A reading of above 50 indicates a positive business outlook.
""We are starting to see a gradual boost from the fiscal and monetary stimulus efforts but it continues to be uneven across industry sectors,"" said Rockwell Financial Group President Aylin Cankardes, who currently serves as a trustee on the board of ELFA Foundation.

Ifo said on Wednesday its June survey of companies showed the business climate index surging to 86.2 from an upwardly revised 79.7 in May - the largest surge since records started after reunification in 1990.
A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a reading of 85.0.
""Companies' assessments of their current situation were somewhat better. Moreover, their expectations leaped higher. German business sees light at the end of the tunnel,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.

""We have passed the economic trough, the low point is behind us and things are looking up again,"" Wohlrabe said. ""Export expectations have risen significantly.""
A robust health care system and widespread testing has helped Germany record fewer fatalities linked to COVID-19 than many other European countries.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased more than expected in May and business activity contracted moderately this month, suggesting the economy was on the cusp of recovering from the recession caused by the COVID-19 crisis.
But a resurgence in confirmed coronavirus cases across the country threatens the nascent signs of improvement evident in Tuesday's economic data. Many states have reported record daily increases in COVID-19 infections, which health experts have blamed on local governments reopening their economies too soon. The economy has stabilized as businesses reopened after closing in mid-March to control the spread of the respiratory illness.
""The renewed upsurge in COVID-19 cases across the South and the West poses a clear downside risk over the coming months but, with a second wave of state-wide lockdowns appearing unlikely for now, we are assuming this will act as a modest drag on the economic recovery, rather than resulting in a renewed downturn,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
New home sales jumped 16.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 676,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. Last month's increase left sales just shy of their pre-COVID-19 level. 
Sales dropped 5.2% in April to a pace of 580,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 14.7% of housing market sales, rising 2.9% to a pace of 640,000 in May.
New home sales are drawn from building permits. Sales surged 12.7% from a year ago in May. The report followed on the heels of data last week showing home purchase applications at an 11-year high in mid-June and permits rebounding strongly in May.
The broader economy slipped into recession in February, leaving nearly 20 million people unemployed as of May. 
In a separate report on Tuesday, data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 46.8 in June from 37 in May. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in private sector output.
The improvement was led by an ebb in the manufacturing sector downturn, with the flash Purchasing Managers Index climbing to 49.6 from 39.8 in May. The survey's services sector flash PMI rose to 46.7 from 37.5 in May. 
Activity is also picking up around the globe. The IHS Markit's euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index recovered to 47.5 from May's 31.9.
Stocks on Wall Street extended gains on the data and hopes of more fiscal stimulus. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
UNEMPLOYMENT HURDLE
The market for new homes is being supported by historic low interest rates and a preference among buyers for single-family homes away from city centers as companies allow employees more flexibility to work from home amid the coronavirus crisis.
But with record unemployment and companies freezing hiring to deal with weak demand and keep costs under control, a sharp rebound in the housing market is unlikely. 
""If the overall economy seems to be slowing, the public may not be quite as confident about putting a down payment on an expensive new home,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Many businesses are insolvent and there will be less spending from unemployed Americans as well that could keep this economic recovery in the slow lane for some time."" 
Last month's increase in new home sales did little to offset a plunge in sales of existing homes in April and May, leaving intact economists' expectations for a record tumble in residential investment in the second quarter. Homebuilding also rebounded moderately in May after slumping in April.
Last month, new home sales shot up 45.5% in the Northeast and advanced 29% in the West. They rose 15.2% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, but fell 6.4% in the Midwest.
The median new house price rose 1.7% to $317,900 in May from a year ago. New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000 to $400,000 price range. 
New homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for about 15% of sales.

There were 318,000 new homes on the market in May, down from 325,000 in April. At May's sales pace it would take 5.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 6.7 months in April. Nearly two-thirds of the homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

The improvement this month came as businesses reopened after shuttering in mid-March to control the spread of the respiratory illness. Still, layoffs continued this month and businesses put a freeze on hiring to deal with weak demand and to cut costs.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Heightened uncertainty in India caused by the coronavirus pandemic has led to a surge in currency in circulation as people hoard cash or park money in accessible deposits to safeguard themselves against salary cuts or job losses.
According to RBI data, India's M3 money supply rose 6.7% in the first five months of this year compared with the same period last year, the highest growth in seven years.
Currency in circulation, which measures money with the public and in banks has also surged.
A rise in money supply usually is seen as a leading indicator of growth in consumption and business investments, but the rise this time is unlikely to bolster either, analysts said.

""We suspect that the recent increase reflects higher cash withdrawals by depositors to meet needs during the lockdown period, until normalcy returns,"" said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Bank.
Gross capital formation, or total investments toward fixed capital in the country, fell 7% in the March quarter, a seven-year low, and analysts expect a further deterioration due to the pandemic. Lenders too are unwilling to take risks as slowing discretionary spending slows for manufactured and industrial goods.

""Risk-averse individuals are putting money in bank deposits, given the high and rising uncertainty, while on the other hand risk-averse lenders are not lending to those who need it,"" said Kunal Kumar Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
However, growth in currency notes held by public was much higher than the deposits made in banks.
Since the end of March, currency held by the public rose 8.2% compared with a 4.1% increase in term deposits, the data showed. Savings and current account deposits fell 8% due to higher withdrawals.

432,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>","Euro zone downturn eased in June, V-shaped recovery in doubt","By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - The historic euro zone economic downturn eased again this month as swathes of businesses reopened after closures to stem the spread of the coronavirus, but a V-shaped recovery may be unlikely, a set of closely-watched surveys showed on Tuesday. 
Over 9 million people globally have been infected by the coronavirus and around 500,000 have died. Although new cases are still being reported, governments across Europe are gradually easing tough restrictions on citizens and businesses.
Surveys measuring the rate of change compared with the previous month showed activity was still contracting across much of Europe, however, with France a stand-out as lockdown loosening there led to a modest return to growth.
IHS Markit's euro zone Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, recovered to 47.5 from May's 31.9, moving closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. It hit a record-low 13.6 in April.
A Reuters poll had predicted a more modest rise to 42.4.
""As much as more than a month of (full) lockdowns had sent economies into a standstill, the gradual reopenings of the last two months have led to a sharp rebound in activity. However, it is anything but certain that the euro zone economy can maintain this momentum,"" said Carsten Brzeski at ING.
""Higher unemployment, companies going out of business, as well as plans to further cut back on staff and falling orders, suggest that the current V-shaped recovery could quickly run out of steam."" 
The bloc's economy is forecast to contract an unprecedented 12.5% this quarter but grow 7.9% in July-September, a Reuters poll predicted earlier this month. [ECILT/EU]
National data showed a private sector recession in Germany eased further this month but coronavirus-related disruptions and uncertainty continued to weigh on demand, suggesting Europe's largest economy is set for a slow recovery.
And while June's German reading was better than expected, concerns about the labour market and ongoing job cuts clouded the outlook.
In France, the bloc's second largest economy, business activity rebounded more than expected and returned to growth after three months of an unprecedented downturn. 
A sharp improvement from May saw the French PMI jump to 51.3, far exceeding the median expectation in a Reuters poll for a reading of 46.3.
Britain's private sector, outside the currency union, shrank less than predicted this month as more businesses restarted work after a lockdown, putting the economy on course to return to growth from July.
""Overall, today's data provide some reassurance that the economy is getting back on its feet. But with some restrictions still in place and fears of a second wave lingering, it will be some time before activity returns to pre-virus levels,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
ROAD TO RECOVERY
Optimism about the coming year has returned, however; the euro zone PMI's future output index, which had been below 50 for three months, recovered to 55.7 from 46.8, its second-largest rise since comparable data were first available in 2012.
Consumer morale also improved this month, data from the European Commission showed on Monday.
The PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry bounced to 47.3 from 30.5 in May, denoting a much shallower contraction and beating the 41.0 forecast.
Factory activity in the region, which was contracting long before the coronavirus, declined again, though at a much slower pace. The manufacturing PMI jumped to 46.9 from 39.4, ahead of the 44.5 median forecast.

But manufacturing headcount was reduced again. The employment sub-index held stubbornly below 50 at 41.3, although it was up from May's 37.6.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's private sector shrank less than expected this month as more businesses restarted work after the COVID-19 lockdown, putting the economy on course to return to growth from next month, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which measures activity in the services sector and manufacturing, jumped to 47.6 in June from 30.0 in May. 
This was a record rise that easily exceeded expectations in a Reuters poll for an increase to 41, though its sub-50 level still represents a modest fall in output.
""June's PMI data add to signs that the economy looks likely to return to growth in the third quarter, especially given the further planned easing of the lockdown from 4th July,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a reduction in social distancing rules to one metre from two later on Tuesday, and set out how pubs and restaurants can follow in the path of shops and reopen to the public.
Last week the BoE said Britain's economy looked on course to have shrunk by around 20% since the coronavirus hit the economy in March -- a smaller decline than it had first feared, but still one of the biggest annual drops in 300 years.
""Longer-term recovery prospects remain highly uncertain,"" Williamson said. ""Uncertainty over recovery prospects and job prospects also mean demand for many goods, especially non-essential big-ticket items, is likely to remain weak for many months, with Brexit uncertainty also continuing to cast a shadow over the economy.""
IHS Markit expects output in 2020 to be 12% below its level in 2019, before expanding by just 5% in 2021 -- a far weaker recovery than the rebound pencilled in by the BoE for next year.
The survey showed faster-than-expected recoveries in June in both manufacturing and the harder-hit services sector.

The manufacturing PMI rose to 50.1 from 40.7 -- just edging out of recessionary territory -- while the services PMI, which does not include retailers, improved to 47.0 from May's 29.0.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's private sector recession eased further in June but coronavirus-related disruptions and uncertainty continued to weigh on demand, a survey showed on Tuesday, suggesting that Europe's largest economy is set for a slow recovery.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, improved to 45.8 from 32.3 in May.
That beat the 44.2 predicted by a Reuters poll of analysts but still marked the fourth month in a row that the index was below the 50 threshold which separates growth from contraction.
Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said manufacturing and services were both ""seemingly over the worst but far from firing on all cylinders"" as concerns about the labour market and ongoing job cuts were clouding the outlook.
The government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year, which would be the steepest contraction since the end of World War Two.
The services sector, which since mid-March had been hardest hit by the gradually imposed lockdown measures, recovered further. The PMI sub-index for business activity in services rose to 45.8 in June from 32.6 in the previous month.
The industrial sector, which in contrast to other European countries did not face forced factory closures in the past three months, also improved, with the PMI sub-index for manufacturing rising to 44.6 from 36.6 in May.

The government hopes that its more than 130 billion euro stimulus package will help bring the economy back onto a growth path in the second half of this year.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales slump to nine and a half year low,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales dropped to their lowest level in more than 9-1/2 years in May, strengthening expectations for a sharp contraction in housing market activity in the second quarter following disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales fell 9.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91 million units last month, the lowest level since October 2010. Last month's sales reflected closings of contracts signed in March and April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would fall 3% to a rate of 4.12 million units in May.
Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, decreased 26.6% on a year-on-year basis in May, the largest annual decline since 1982.
May was probably the nadir for the existing housing market, with applications for home loans surging to an 11-year high in recent weeks amid record low mortgage rates. Data last week showed a sharp rebound in building permits in May.
Though businesses have reopened after being shuttered in mid-March to control the spread of COVID-19, nearly 20 million people are unemployed. In addition, the supply of homes available for sale is still tight, indicating a strong housing market recovery is unlikely.
Last month's slump in home sales, together with a modest rise in homebuilding in May, suggested a decline in residential investment this quarter after it grew at its fastest rate in more than seven years in the first quarter.
Home sales last month declined in all four U.S. regions.
There were 1.55 million previously owned homes on the market in May, down 18.8% from a year ago. The median existing house price rose 2.3% from a year ago to $284,600 in May. That was the smallest gain since February 2012.
At May's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 4.3 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales dropped to their lowest level in more than 9-1/2 years in May, strengthening expectations for a sharp contraction in housing market activity in the second quarter following disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The report from the National Association of Realtors on Monday also showed the smallest annual home price increase in more than eight years. The slump in existing home sales reflected closings on contracts signed in March and April, when nearly the whole country was under lockdowns to slow the spread of the respiratory illness.
With applications for home loans surging to an 11-year high in recent weeks amid record low mortgage rates, May was probably the nadir for the existing housing market. Data last week showed a sharp rebound in building permits in May. But nearly 20 million people are unemployed and housing supply remains tight. 
""Home sales may bounce with pent-up demand following the shutdown of the economy starting in March, but the massive scale of job losses and cautious consumers rebuilding their savings may limit sales,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""There is still a long road to recovery for the broader economy."" 
Existing home sales fell 9.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91 million units last month, the lowest level since October 2010. It was the third straight monthly drop. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would fall 3% to a rate of 4.12 million units in May.
Home resales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, decreased 26.6% on a year-on-year basis in May, the largest annual decline since 1982. There were 1.55 million previously owned homes on the market in May, down 18.8% from a year ago. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors weighed stimulus-fueled recovery hopes against an increase in U.S. coronavirus infections. The PHLX housing index (HGX) was little changed. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SHIFT TO SUBURBS
Home sales fell in all four regions last month. The NAR said with many companies allowing greater flexibility for employees to work from home amid the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for housing was skewed towards single-family homes, mostly in the suburbs.
Economists believe the migration to suburbs from city centers could ease some of the housing shortage. A homebuilder survey last week showed strong demand in June for single-family homes in inner and outer suburbs featuring lower density neighborhoods.
Single-family home sales dropped 24.8% in May from a year ago, while multi-family homes plunged 41.4%. 
The median existing house price rose 2.3% from a year ago to $284,600 in May. That was the smallest gain since February 2012. Though single-family home prices increased, the median condominium price fell.
""Although demand certainly dropped in March and April due to the crisis, supply dropped even more, and has thus far kept home prices from declining,"" said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. ""We expect that home price growth will pick up over the summer due to insufficient supply levels.""
Last month's slump in home sales, together with a modest rise in homebuilding in May, suggested a big drop in residential investment this quarter after it grew at its fastest rate in more than seven years in the first quarter.
Economists are forecasting residential investment will decline at around a 20% annualized rate in the second quarter. That would contribute to gross domestic product sinking at as much as a 37.5% pace during that period, they say. 
The economy contracted at a 5% rate in the first quarter, the sharpest since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
At May's sales pace, it would take 4.8 months to exhaust the current inventory of pre-owned homes on the market, up from 4.3 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 26 days, down from 27 days in April, but matching the duration a year ago. Fifty-eight percent of homes sold in May were on the market for less than a month.

First-time buyers accounted for 34% of sales in May, down from 36% in April but up from 32% a year ago.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's tourism-dependent Algarve region saw its number of unemployed triple in May compared with a year ago as the coronavirus crisis kept foreign visitors away, wiping out thousands of seasonal jobs, data showed on Monday.
In Portugal as a whole, the total of those without jobs rose by 34% from a year earlier to nearly 409,000 people, data from the Institute for Employment and Vocational Training revealed.
The Bank of Portugal forecast last week that the jobless rate, which had been falling steadily under the ruling Socialists, to 6.5% in 2019, would jump to 10.1% this year, slightly above the government's own estimate of 9.6%.
In the southern Algarve, famous for its beaches and golf courses, the total number of those out of work spiked to 27,675 in May from 9,153 in the same month of 2019. 
The number of new unemployment registrations fell, however, to 1,296 in May from 4,700 in April, as Portugal started phasing out restrictions to prevent contagion. 
With no tourists in sight, even those who haven't lost their jobs are scared of what the future holds. 
""I know it's weird to say this but we need foreigners to be able to work,"" said 32-year-old Daniela Valerio, who works at a pub in Vilamoura Marina, which is usually thronged with tourists at this time of year. ""The foreigners pay our wages.""
The tourism industry contributed 14.6% to gross domestic product in 2018, according to the latest official data, and helped drive recovery from a severe debt crisis in 2010-14.
Portugal has reported 39,133 coronavirus cases and 1,539 deaths, far fewer than in neighbouring Spain.

But a persistent several hundred new coronavirus cases per day and a growing outbreak after a party in the Algarve are threatening the country's image as a safe holiday destination.

Average daily shipments fell 16% in the first twenty days of the month compared with the prior year, South Korea’s customs office said Monday, improving from a decline that exceeded 20% in May.
Total semiconductor shipments, the country’s biggest source of trade income, rose 2.6%, while those of ships increased 36%. Exports to China, South Korea’s largest overseas market, climbed 15%.
A smaller drop in South Korean exports, which are seen as a barometer of world trade, support signs the pandemic’s grip on the global economy may be loosening as key markets start to reopen and China’s factories increase production.
Still, it’s too early for full-fledged optimism given the potential for new waves of infection and the recent heightening of U.S.-China trade tensions.
“The tensions are likely to persist, especially ahead of the U.S. presidential election,” said Mun Byung-ki, a researcher at the Korea International Trade Association. “That’s another variable to watch for on top of fears about the second wave of infections, which could have less impact on exports than the first, though, if a shutdowns can be avoided.”

Export orders for Taiwan, seen as a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 0.4% from a year earlier to $38.9 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Saturday. The uptick, however, lagged a Reuters poll estimate for a 1.1% rise compared with 2.3% growth in April.
The ministry, which has repeatedly cautioned of a difficult outlook for Taiwan's orders due to the coronavirus impact, said the May numbers were helped by ""flourishing"" demand for equipment from people working from home.
Looking ahead, the outlook was brighter with the pandemic abating in Europe and the United States and economic activity gradually resuming around the world, it added.
However, it cautioned that uncertainties from the pandemic, as well as China-U.S. trade tensions, could still harm Taiwan's export.
The ministry said it expects June export orders to be in a range of 0% growth to a 3.9% rise from a year earlier.
Taiwan's manufacturers, a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies, have been hit hard by faltering global demand for electronics in the wake of containment measures and lockdowns in many countries.
May orders from the United States rose 8.6% from a year earlier, compared with 6.8% growth in April, while those from China were up 2.7% versus a 9.2% gain the previous month. European orders rose 12.3% but were down 8.1% from Japan.
Taiwan's economic growth slowed to its weakest in nearly four years in the first quarter as the pandemic crimped domestic consumption and tourism.

In response, the government has stepped up support measures, and is rolling out a stimulus package it expects will eventually be worth T$1.05 trillion ($35.01 billion).

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Economists cut their estimates for Canada's April GDP numbers on Friday, after a plunge in retail sales capped out a grim week of data reflecting the deep impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Canadian economy.
Canada posted record declines in wholesale trade, factory sales and retail sales this week as lockdowns designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus hammered the economy, data showed.
That means April GDP could fall up to 15%, compared with Statistics Canada's flash estimate of 11% drop, said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
April GDP data will be released on June 30.
""I think (the economy is) in a deeper hole than StatsCan first estimated a few weeks ago when they gave us a preliminary estimate of the April GDP decline,"" Porter said.
CIBC Economics now expects April GDP to fall between 13%-14%, but senior economist Royce Mendes said the May flash estimate of 19.1% gain for retail sales suggest a more vigorous rebound. Manufacturing and wholesale trade data could show signs of improvement in May, according to Statistics Canada.
""That leaves the quarter largely around the same range,"" said Mendes.
Yet, Mendes expects all major categories of the GDP to be well below pre-coronavirus levels at the end of the summer, even as stores and businesses reopen and the GDP starts to rise.
""We're growing, but we're growing from a very low base,"" he said.
The Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said this week April appears to have been the trough in the downturn, which has left Canada in a ""deep hole"" and ""its going to be a long way out of this hole.""
Whether a full recovery takes months or years is anyone's guess, say economists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. current account deficit dipped to a near two-year low in the first quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic restricted the flow of goods and services, while companies continued to repatriate profits back home.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, slipped 0.1% to $104.2 billion, the smallest since the second quarter of 2018. A drop in imports and income payments narrowly outpaced a decline in exports and income receipts. 
Data for the fourth quarter was revised to show the gap narrowing to $104.3 billion, instead of $109.8 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account gap shrinking to $103 billion in the January-March quarter. 
The current account gap represented 1.9% of gross domestic product in the first quarter, the smallest share since the third quarter of 2017.
""The figures reinforce a dire outlook for trade, and we expect import and export volumes to drop at record rates this year,"" said James Watson, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""With global demand falling further than domestic demand, we expect the current account to widen sharply in the second quarter.""
The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which compiles the data, attributed the drop ""in part, due to the impact of COVID-19, as many businesses were operating at limited capacity or ceased operations completely, and the movement of travelers across borders was restricted.""
Exports plunged to a 10-year low in April, which economists said set up the current account deficit to widen to as much as $120 billion in the second quarter. 
In the first quarter, exports of goods and services and income received from foreign residents fell $47.5 billion, the biggest drop in 11 years, to $902.2 billion. That was the lowest level since the third quarter of 2017.
Imports of goods and services and income payments to foreign residents declined $47.7 billion to $1.01 trillion, also the lowest level since the third quarter of 2017. That drop was also the biggest since the first quarter of 2009.
PROFITS REPATRIATED 
Despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic, American companies repatriated $124.2 billion in profits in the first quarter, the most in over a year, up from $83.6 billion in the prior period. 
A surge in repatriations in 2018 was fueled by a Republican tax overhaul, which reduced much of the tax liability for bringing back earnings from foreign subsidiaries, although the flows subsided substantially in 2019. 
A large portion of the repatriated money funded stock buybacks and dividends. It was not immediately clear whether the surge in the first quarter was directly a result of U.S. companies' need to shore up their domestic balance sheets. 
In the early stages of the coronavirus crisis, however, activity in corporate funding markets all but dried up, and companies broadly tapped into whatever sources of liquidity were available.
(GRAPHIC - U.S. companies' repatriated foreign earnings: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprroejpe/Pasted%20image%201592577389592.png)
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the import bill had been shrinking because of the Trump administration's trade war with China. The United States has also become a net exporter of crude and fuel, the result of a production surge that has dramatically reduced the nation's dependence on foreign oil. 
Goods trade with China collapsed in the first quarter. 
Investment income also took a hit last quarter as COVID-19 restrictions impacted earnings. 
The surplus on primary income - which includes investment income such as dividends and employee compensation - dropped to $52.5 billion, the smallest since the third quarter of 2016, from $62 billion in the fourth quarter. There was a record drop in foreign direct investment. 
Primary income receipts fell $27.8 billion to $255.1 billion. The deficit on secondary income, which includes U.S. government grants, pensions, fines and penalties, and worker remittances, increased $1.1 billion to a record $37.6 billion.
The Federal Reserve's expansion of currency swap lines with more than a dozen foreign central banks to ease a global dollar crunch early in the crisis contributed to record increases in assets and liabilities in the U.S. financial account.

The economy ministry said the decline has slowed down in manufacturing and retail sectors. 
It also said that the economic recovery was restrained by a global deal to curb oil output starting from May 1. Oil and gas condensate production last month fell by 14.5% year-on-year. 
In the five four months of 2020, gross domestic product shrank by 3.7% in year-on-year terms, the ministry said.

In the whole of 2020, Russia's economy is on track to shrink by 4.8%, the economy ministry forecasts.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's central bank slashed interest rates on Friday to the lowest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union, pledging to consider the need for even lower rates amid waning inflationary risks and a shrinking economy.
The central bank delivered a deeper-than-usual cut of 100 basis points, taking the key rate to 4.5% , in the face of the crisis sparked by the coronavirus and the related lockdowns, in line with a Reuters poll. 
Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the economy may feel the impact of the monetary easing in three to six quarters, adding that the strengthening rouble provides more room for monetary easing.
""We will further assess the feasibility of extra measures to ease our monetary policy, to lower the rate,"" Nabiullina said at an online media conference, presenting the rate move.
Lower rates make lending cheaper, spur spending and could help relieve the economic contraction caused by the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than half a million people in the country.
Lower rates, however, are unlikely to have a strong direct impact on the economy's post-pandemic recovery, analysts said.
Nabiullina said the central bank sees an increasing number of reasons to revise the 6% to 7% range it deems to be neutral monetary policy, which analysts said implied lowering that range.
In 2020, the central bank said, the economy will contract by 4% to 6% before returning to growth in 2021. Inflation is likely to finish the year close to the 4% target, peaking early next year, the central bank said.
Analysts split over the chances for more rate cuts.
ING said another 50-basis-point cut was ""highly likely this year"", Capital Economics foresaw the key rate at 3.5% by year-end, and Sberbank said the central bank may consider lowering the key rate below the 4% inflation target.
Renaissance Capital said Friday's rhetoric suggested the central bank's rate reached its final level unless there is a new global wave of the coronavirus pandemic in coming months.

Nabiullina said the central bank's base scenario does not envisages the risks of a second wave of the coronavirus.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales plummeted 26.4% in April, posting a record decline for a second consecutive month, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to wallop the economy, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday, but sales are expected to rebound in May.
Officials shut most non-essential businesses across Canada, beginning in mid-March, to slow the spread of the coronavirus and urged people to stay home.
Sales were down in all 11 subsectors for the first time in 27 years, with motor vehicle and parts dealers taking the largest hit in April. Food and beverage stores and gasoline stations also contributed to the decline.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a 15.1% decline for April, while a Statistics Canada flash estimate released last month predicted a 15.6% decline. The statistical agency revised March's record decline to 9.9% from an initial 10%.
In a preliminary flash estimate, Statistics Canada said retail sales in May could rise by 19.1%.
""It's a long road back from these April lows,"" said BMO Chief Economist Doug Porter in a note. 
All 10 Canadian provinces posted double-digit slumps, with the largest drops occurring in Ontario and Quebec, Canada's two most populous provinces. Retail sales plunged 32.8% in Ontario, while Quebec posted a 27.8% decline.
""Retailers were devastated by the shutdowns and physical distancing measures employed in April,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.
""It wasn't all bad news in the report though. Retailers who had an online presence were able to capitalize on some of the shifts in buying patterns,"" he said.

Online sales surged to a record high, representing 9.5% of the total retail market, Statscan said, while on a year-over-year basis, retail e-commerce more than doubled.

TOKYO - Japan's core consumer prices fell for a second straight month in May, reinforcing deflation expectations and raising the challenge for policymakers battling to revive an economy reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.
The data will likely complicate the Bank of Japan's job of restoring growth and inflation, with a raft of recent indicators suggesting the nation is in the grip of its worst postwar economic slump.
Several BOJ board members warned that stronger monetary support and closer policy coordination with the government were needed to prevent Japan from returning to deflation, minutes of the bank's April meeting showed.
""With the pandemic hurting the economy, there's a good chance Japan may slide into deflation. Downward pressure on prices will likely persist throughout this year,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil but excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell 0.2% in May from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.
That compared with market forecasts of a 0.1% fall and followed a 0.2% drop in April, which was the first year-on-year decline since December 2016.
The BOJ kept policy steady this week after expanding stimulus in March and April. But governor Haruhiko Kuroda conceded that inflation would remain well short of its 2% target for years to come.
The downturn in growth is also likely to have been exacerbated by Japan's state of emergency in April through late May, which prompted people to stay home and businesses to close.
As businesses re-open after the lifting of lockdown measures, the government raised its economic assessment in June for the first time since 2018.
Japan also lifted all coronavirus-related curbs on domestic travel on Friday, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calling on people to go sightseeing or attend events to help the nation's economy bounce back.
But analysts doubt Japan's economy can rebound strongly from an expected contraction of more than 20% in the current quarter.
Some BOJ policymakers were concerned that bolder steps are needed to prevent the country from slipping back to sustained period of damaging price declines, the April minutes showed.

""Japan is now facing the risk of deflation, so it's possible to further enhance coordination between fiscal and monetary policies,"" one BOJ board member was quoted as saying.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Business sentiment among Japan's big manufacturers in the second quarter likely tanked to levels last seen during the 2009 global financial crisis as the coronavirus pandemic crushed global demand and paralysed factory output, a Reuters poll showed.
The Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" survey is also likely to show big non-manufacturers' mood sinking to more than a decade-low, underscoring the sweeping economic impact of the global health crisis. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the BOJ tankan's diffusion index for big manufacturers to have hit -31 in the three months to June, down sharply from -8 in the first quarter survey. That would be the worst level since September 2009, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers a year earlier triggered a deep global economic downturn.
Big non-manufacturers' index likely worsened to -18 in the June quarter from +8 three months ago, the poll showed, as lockdown measures to contain the virus forced citizens to stay home and retailers to close. That would mark the weakest level since December 2009.
""Manufacturers were hit hard by slumping overseas demand and exports,"" said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Even harder hit were non-manufacturers. Sectors that were forced to close business due to state of emergency measures in April and May likely suffered devastating damage,"" he said.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect only modest improvements in business conditions three months ahead, the poll showed.
Big firms are likely to project a 2.1% increase in capital expenditure for the current fiscal year beginning in April, roughly unchanged from a 1.8% increase forecast in the March tankan, according to the Reuters poll.
Analysts are also closely watching how companies view job market conditions, as any evidence of excess labour capacity could signal rising job losses ahead.

The BOJ will release the tankan survey at 8:50 a.m. on July 1. (2350 GMT July 30).

451,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 10:54PM ET</span>",Australians Come Out of Lockdown And Spend Like Never Before,"(Bloomberg) -- Australians took to the shops in May as the initial easing of the Covid-19 lockdown, combined with stimulus cash flowing into bank accounts, fueled record monthly sales.
Preliminary retail figures showed turnover rose 16.3% from April, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Friday in Sydney. Following a record 17.7% slump in April, May’s increase was the largest in 38 years of published surveys, with gains in every industry, the bureau said.
“There were large rises for clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing and cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services, as restrictions on trade were lifted during May,” the bureau said.
Australian household bank balances surged during the lockdown from the transfer of government payments and a pullback in spending in April. The surge in spending in May corresponds with the rapid recovery of consumer confidence as the infection curve flattened, which allowed a staged reopening of the economy earlier than expected.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Say
“As lockdowns have eased, retail spending has rebounded strongly. Sales have more than exceeded prior trends, but this signals a shift -- rather than a recovery -- in household spending. In addition to stimulus support and pent up demand from the lockdown, elevated retail spending reflects a diversion from non-retail activities that remain shut down, and the retention of spending inside Australia that Australians would ordinarily make during offshore travels.”
James McIntyre, economist
Lockdowns and restrictions continue to skew food and beverage sales toward home consumption.
“Food retailing rose as households continued to consume additional food and beverages at home during May,” the statistics bureau said. “Levels in liquor retailing remain high, as restrictions on hospitality, such as bars, clubs and events, remained in place for May.”
Final retail sales data for May are due out July 3.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer sentiment recorded its biggest improvement in nearly four years this month as coronavirus lockdown restrictions eased, though it still remains far below its level at the start of this year, a survey showed on Friday.
The GfK consumer confidence index, Britain's longest-running such survey, increased to its highest since March at -30, up from -36 in late May, which was the lowest reading since the depths of the financial crisis.
The improvement matches other data showing some recovery since economic output collapsed by an unprecedented 20% in April, when many businesses suspended operations, shops closed to the public and workers were told to stay home were possible.
However GfK said the improvement was not guaranteed to last.
""With the labour market set for more job losses, we have to question whether we are seeing early signs of economic recovery or that infamous 'dead cat bounce'. Most bets will be on the dead cat,"" GfK director Joe Staton said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday that the economy appeared to be on course to shrink less in the first half of the year than he had feared last month, though this did not necessarily mean there would be a strong rebound.
More than 9 million workers currently unable to do their jobs due to the lockdown have been cushioned from the immediate risk of unemployment by a government wage support programme. But this is due to end in October, and it is unclear if sectors such as hospitality will be back operating at normal capacity then.
The GfK survey, which is conducted on behalf of the European Commission, is more than 20 points lower than its level at the start of this year. 

The improvement in June was the sharpest in nearly 4 years, and was driven by households' greater confidence in the outlook for their personal finances and the general economy over the next year, as well as more willingness to make big purchases.

454,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market improvement stalling; second wave of layoffs seen,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, but the pace of decline has stalled amid a second wave of layoffs as companies battle weak demand and fractured supply chains, supporting views that the economy faces a long and difficult recovery from the COVID-19 recession.
The Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, sketched a picture of a distressed labor market even though employers hired a record 2.5 million workers in May as businesses reopened after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19. At least 29 million people are collecting unemployment checks.
Stubbornly high joblessness could stifle the nascent signs of economic recovery that had been flagged by a record jump in retail sales in May and a sharp rebound in permits for future home construction. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that ""significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery."" 
The economy fell into recession in February.
""The recent sightings of green shoots for economic growth are going to fade in a hurry if workers can't return to the jobs they lost during the pandemic recession,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Over 20 million out of work without a paycheck is a lot of spending missing from the economy."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 58,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.508 million for the week ended June 13. Data for the prior week was revised to show 24,000 more applications received than previously reported, bringing the tally for that period to 1.566 million.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dropping to 1.3 million in the latest week. The 11th straight weekly decrease pushed claims further away from a record 6.867 million in late March. Still, claims are more than double their peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
Claims fell most notably in Florida and California, but rose in Texas and Washington state. 
""Labor market problems have shifted away from mass closings and layoffs in immediate response to shutdown orders, and toward still-catastrophic numbers of new layoffs related to the long-term, reverberating effects of a recession,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York. 
A separate report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed labor market conditions remained depressed in June at factories in the mid-Atlantic region even as manufacturing activity in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware rebounded sharply.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
MILLIONS ON UNEMPLOYMENT ROLLS
From manufacturing, retail, information technology and oil and gas production, companies have announced job cuts. State and local governments, whose budgets have been shattered by the COVID-19 fight, are also cutting jobs.
Economists expect an acceleration in layoffs when the government's Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, giving businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for wages, runs out.
The PPP was credited for a drop in the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid from a record 24.912 million in early May. But these so-called continued claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, also appear to have since stalled. The claims report showed continuing claims dropped 62,000 to 20.544 million the week ending June 6, suggesting companies were gradually recalling workers.
Initial claims covered the week during which the government surveyed establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of June's employment report. Economists, however, cautioned claims were no longer a good predictor of job growth. 
Some believe states are still processing applications filed in the last three months after systems were overwhelmed by the unprecedented volume. 
The government has expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits to include the self-employed and independent contractors who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including through lost employment, reduced hours and wages.
These workers do not qualify for the regular state unemployment insurance. They must file under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. States are also processing applications for workers who have exhausted their regular benefits under a program funded by the government.
Applications under these two programs are not included in the initial claims count. Filings for PUA increased 66,063 to 760,526 last week. About 29.2 million people were receiving unemployment benefits under all programs during the week ending May 30, the latest available data, compared to 29.5 million in the prior period. 
Unemployment checks for millions will run out at the end of July, a fiscal cliff that could undercut the recovery.

""Fiscal policy will have to step up once again,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Otherwise household incomes will fall sharply and much of the current rebound will fade.""

The Philadelphia Federal Reserve said on Thursday its business conditions index jumped to a reading of 27.5 this month from -43.1 in May. Manufacturers reported a rebound in new orders, though labor market conditions remained depressed at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
Manufacturers were fairly optimistic about business conditions over the next six months. The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month business conditions index rose to a reading of 66.3 this month from 49.7 in May.

The initial claims number was higher than forecasts for 1.3 million and was only slightly down from 1.54 million in the prior week. It snapped ten straight weeks of declines, as claims receded from a record peak of 6.87 million in late March. Still, claims are roughly double their peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession.

""People will say claims are coming down, but for an economy that is reopening, that is a huge number,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.
""The economy is losing workers and employment beyond the initial impact tied to businesses that shut down. There are a lot of industries that are getting hurt and that's starting to cascade down, that is what those numbers are showing.""
Continuing claims, which show the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, came in above expectations at 20.54 million in the week ended June 6, down just slightly from 20.6 million a week earlier.

BERN (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank will keep its ultra-expansive monetary policy for ""some time"" after cutting its inflation outlook and saying it needs negative rates and currency interventions to shield Switzerland from the coronavirus driven-recession.
Switzerland is facing its sharpest downturn in decades after the pandemic shut down many businesses, pushed up unemployment and dented demand at home and abroad.
The SNB expects Swiss GDP to shrink 6% this year, the worst downturn since the aftermath of oil price shocks in the 1970s, and sees no rise in consumer prices before 2022, and then by just 0.2%.
On Thursday the SNB kept its policy interest rate and the rate it charges on sight deposits at minus 0.75%, as unanimously expected by analysts polled by Reuters.
""I believe it will be necessary to maintain this expansionary monetary policy for some time,"" SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said.
""We need a completely different outlook before we can change monetary policy, more inflation and also a much better economic outlook,"" he told journalists.
The Swiss franc weakened slightly against the euro after the decision. (EURCHF=)
The SNB's new conditional inflation forecast of below 2% over the entire forecast horizon, suggests it will hold the policy rate until at least the first quarter of 2023, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economist Maxime Botteron.
At EFG Bank, economist GianLuigi Mandruzzato also said he did not see rates, which have been negative since 2014, rising until 2023 unless the recovery was much stronger than anticipated.
""The SNB maintains a clear dovish bias, leaving the door open to further accommodation, but not necessarily more negative interest rates, particularly if the risk of new (COVID-19) infections crystallises,"" he said.
In the meantime, analysts expect the SNB to keep restraining the Swiss franc mainly through increased currency interventions.
The safe-haven franc rose to its highest level against the euro in nearly five years last month, prompting the SNB to ramp up foreign currency purchases in order to protect the export-orientated economy.
Sight deposits - a proxy for SNB interventions - have risen by nearly 100 billion Swiss francs ($105 billion) this year, dwarfing interventions for the whole of 2018 and 2019.
Jordan said the central bank had made ""substantial interventions"" in recent weeks, and could continue to do so if necessary to maintain reasonable financial and monetary conditions.

""There is no specific limit ... we are forced to do that to bring inflation back over time to the range of price stability.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's central bank unexpectedly left its policy rate unchanged on Thursday but further reduced its growth forecast for 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to deal a further blow to the trade-reliant economy.
Its decision to stay on hold bucked a rush by global central banks to loosen monetary settings as policymakers scramble to boost growth and financial stability due to crumbling investor sentiment. 
Taiwan's central bank left the benchmark discount rate  at 1.125%, where it has stood since March when it lowered the rate to a historic low.
The median forecast of 16 economists in a Reuters poll was for the discount rate to be cut to 1%.
""The rate cut was effective and consumption will gradually pick up. We will wait for a while and see,"" central bank governor Yang Chin-long told reporters, referring to the possibility of further rate cuts ahead. 
The central bank cut its full-year economic growth outlook to 1.52% from 1.92% forecast in March, saying the virus outbreak could curb Taiwan's exports, but that there were signs of economic recovery.
""Although the global economy still faces many uncertainties, the domestic economy is likely to recover mildly, supported by domestic demand,"" it said in a statement.
The central bank said it expects growth in the second half to be stronger than the first half, helped by government stimulus and continuous capital investment in the semiconductor sector, but added uncertainty remained due to the coronavirus.
Yang said consumption would probably grow in the third and fourth quarters, thanks to a series of stimulus programmes expected to eventually total T$1 trillion ($33.8 billion).
He added that Taiwan's economic recovery is likely to be ""Nike-shaped"", pointing to stronger growth in the second half than the first.
Economists have referred to  Nike  (NYSE:NKE)'s Swoosh logo, or sloping L shape, to describe a recovery that is steady and gradual.
However, Taiwan's GDP forecast is still a lot more bullish than many banks, some of which, like  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), expect the economy to contract this year.
While Taiwan has largely shaken off the pandemic with just five active coronavirus cases, the outbreak has hurt the job market and consumption, pushing the government to roll out its stimulus package to help soften the impact.
The central bank also lowered its 2020 core inflation forecast to 0.36%, adding it expected inflation to stabilise in the second half and that deflation was unlikely.

The construction, manufacturing, and food and accommodation sectors saw the highest proportion of their workers returning from furlough, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey of businesses showed.
Some 79% of workers in a separate official survey said they were working either from home or at their workplace as of June 14, up from 70% the previous week, the ONS said.
Thursday's data are intended to offer an up-to-date steer on the latest economic trends and are classified by the ONS as experimental, unlike its traditional but lagging gauges of the labour market.
Earlier this week the ONS said the number of people on British employers' payrolls fell by more than 600,000 in April and May as the coronavirus lockdown hit the labour market, and vacancies plunged by the most on record.

Britain's government said this week more than 9 million jobs - about a third of the workforce - were being supported by its furlough scheme, at a cost of over 20 billion pounds ($25 billion) so far.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's central bank on Thursday cut its benchmark rate for the third time this year and signalled it may ease further, as Southeast Asia's largest economy struggles to avoid a recession amid the broadening fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.
Bank Indonesia (BI) cut the 7-day reverse repurchase rate  by 25 basis points to 4.25%, the lowest since 2018, and Governor Perry Warjiyo said there was space for more cuts as long as the rupiah remained stable.
Thursday's cut was predicted by the majority of economists in a Reuters poll.
The move came a few days after the finance minister warned of recession risks, with gross domestic product expected to shrink by 3.1% in the second quarter - the first contraction since 1999 - and possibly contract again in the following three months.
BI trimmed its outlook for 2020 GDP growth to 0.9%-1.9% from 2.3% and pledged to keep all of BI's instruments ""accommodative"".
""With all of these factors: inflation low, the need to lift GDP growth, a small current account deficit, we say there is room for further rate cuts,"" Warjiyo told a virtual briefing.
""The timing would depend on global conditions and ensuring the stability of the rupiah is maintained,"" he said.
The rupiah  strengthened after the announcement before settling little changed at 14,010 a dollar, while the main stock index (JKSE) fell 1.3% after the announcement.
Warjiyo said the currency was undervalued and could strengthen for the remainder of the year.
In total, BI has trimmed its key rate by 75 bps so far this year to stimulate economic activity, on top of four reductions amounting to 100 bps in 2019.
Capital Economics' analyst Gareth Leather expects BI to continue with gradual easing over coming months due to ""the very poor outlook for the economy"".
Bahana Sekuritas' economist Satria Sambijantoro in Jakarta, who expects another 25 bps cut, said the pace of economic contraction in the second quarter may not be different to the double-digit falls seen in Singapore and Thailand.
""A response from the central bank, especially rate-cuts, would be necessary to maintain investors confidence that policymakers are ready to mitigate growth risks,"" he said.
Bank Danamon and ANZ also see a further 25-bp rate cut.
The government has budgeted nearly $50 billion to support the pandemic-hit economy, but had only doled out a small amount.
The country reported its biggest daily rise in coronavirus cases on Thursday, taking total infections to 42,762, with 2,339 deaths.

“The Committee’s current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the policy rate will most likely remain at today’s level for some time ahead, Norges Bank Governor Oystein Olsen said in a statement on Thursday.
“The policy rate forecast implies a rate at the current level over the next couple of years, followed by a gradual rise as economic conditions normalize,” the bank said.
Norges Bank has gone to historic lengths to support the economy this year, wiping 1.5 percentage points off the policy rate, threatening currency interventions and providing banks with cheap credit. As western Europe’s biggest oil exporter, Norway has faced a double crisis, with an unprecedented slump in crude prices adding to the economic devastation caused by Covid-19.
But recent data suggest the worst might be over. The government of Prime Minister Erna Solberg was quick to impose a strict lockdown, bringing Covid-19 contagion rates under control and allowing Norway to reopen much of the economy sooner than others.
Norges Bank now sees Norway’s mainland economy shrinking 3.5% this year. It had previously expected a contraction of 5.2%. Next year, the economy is estimated grow 3.7%, it said.
In its Monetary Policy Report, Norges Bank indicated there’s a slight chance it could start raising rates as soon as 2022. In May, the bank had signaled zero rates until the end of 2023.
“Activity has picked up faster than expected. Unemployment has fallen more than anticipated and oil prices have risen. Activity is nevertheless substantially lower than at the start of the year, and there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the path to recovery,” the bank said.
The krone gained against the euro after the announcement, and traded about 0.5% higher as of 10:08 a.m. in Oslo.
What’s more, Norway’s status as the owner of the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund gives the government considerably more scope to provide fiscal support than many other countries. Solberg’s administration has already pledged record measures to support the labor market and businesses. The government plans to withdraw a record 368 billion kroner ($39 billion) from its wealth fund to cover the extra spending.

Keeping interest rates unchanged, SNB chief Thomas Jordan reiterated that the currency is “highly valued,” and said the central bank will continue to sell it as needed. Officials warned that the economy will contract about 6% this year.
The SNB has stuck with its tried-and-tested approach of negative interest rates and a pledge to intervene in currency markets even as its peers have ramped up their actions. The Bank of England, which announces its latest policy decision later on Thursday, and the U.S. Federal Reserve have cut rates, while the European Central Bank launched a new 1.35 trillion-euro ($1.5 trillion) asset purchase program.
“In light of the highly valued Swiss franc it remains willing to intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market, the SNB said Thursday.
With the global economy in recession, the epidemic has effectively dealt trade-reliant Switzerland a triple whammy. Some of its key export markets went into lockdown, and consumer spending softened, while the franc strengthened.
Seen as a haven by investors in times of market or geopolitical stress, the currency has been on an almost non-stop upward trend for the past year, exacerbating deflationary pressures.
The SNB has responded by stepping up the pace of its foreign exchange interventions, likely wagering the largest sums in years to stall its rally. Still, the franc touched a five-year peak against the euro last month and remains stronger than 1.10 versus the single currency.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>","Australia jobless rate surges to 19-year high in May, slow recovery seen","By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's unemployment rate jumped to the highest in about two decades in May as nearly a quarter of a million people lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic-driven shutdowns.
Employment in May plunged a further 227,700 after a record slump of about 600,000 in April, figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Thursday showed.
The unemployment rate shot up to 7.1%, the highest since October 2001, from an upwardly revised 6.4% in April and broadly in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll.
The figures highlight the economic damage wrought by the pandemic as mobility restrictions forced business to down shutters since late March.
""Although it’s early days, there are signs that May will be the worst month for the labour market,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics, pointing to an improvement in job advertisements.
""But the scale of the job losses means it will likely be years before the labour market has fully recovered.""
The ABS said the jobless rate would have been even higher at 11.3% were it not for a government wage subsidy scheme that allowed businesses to keep staff on their payrolls.
As a result, fewer people went looking for work, sending the participation rate to 62.9% from 63.6% in April.
The number of employees who worked fewer hours or no hours at all fell to 1.55 million from 1.8 million in April, with those working zero hours halving to 360,000
Australia is facing its first recession in nearly three decades with the country's central bank predicting the jobless rate to hit 10% by June and stay elevated through 2021.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has gone all-in by cutting rates to a record low of 0.25%, flooding the financial system with cash and even buying government bonds to lower borrowing rates for business.

""It’s possible the unemployment rate won’t rise much further though we suspect a rebound in the participation rate will keep it elevated for a while yet,"" Marcel Thieliant, senior economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.

China will reduce the reserve requirement ratio and use its relending policy to keep liquidity ample, state television reported Wednesday, citing a State Council meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang. The council, which is China’s cabinet, also urged financial institutions to support companies by sacrificing 1.5 trillion yuan ($212 billion) in profits this year by offering lower lending rates, deferring loan repayments and cutting fees.
China Wants Banks to Cap Their Profit Gains to Single Digits
The People’s Bank of China is trying to bring down borrowing costs across the economy to aid the recovery from the coronavirus slump in the first quarter, without engaging in large-scale debt stimulus seen elsewhere. That stance has however contributed to rising bond yields and concerns that market and monetary conditions are tightening.
“An RRR cut is likely to come shortly, perhaps even this weekend,” according to Lu Ting, chief China economist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. in Hong Kong. “The policy strategy to squeeze banks might be positive for markets and economy first, but could backfire later if non-performing loans rise too fast and the government has to come to rescue banks on a large scale.”
The government “will continue to guide lending and bond interest rates down, give out loans with preferential interest rates, defer payment of principal and interest on loans to medium-sized, small and micro enterprises, support the issuance of unsecured loans for SMEs, and reduce bank charges,” according to the CCTV statement.
The reserve ratio currently stands at 11% for large banks, with lower requirements for smaller lenders.
PBOC Governor Yi Gang, China Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman Yi Huiman and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission Chairman Guo Shuqing will speak Thursday morning at the annual Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, according to the forum’s website.

467,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>","Global Woes, Rising Dollar Are Problems for Taiwan Central Bank","(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan may have avoided going into coronavirus lockdown, but the central bank is likely to cut its benchmark rate for a second time this year as shrinking domestic consumption and Asia’s strongest currency weigh on policy makers’ minds.
Taiwan’s monetary authority will cut its key lending rate to a record low of 1% at a board meeting on Thursday, according to the median estimate of 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. This comes after the central bank lowered borrowing costs further than forecast to 1.125% in March after keeping them unchanged for almost four years.
Taiwan’s economy has been relatively sheltered from the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, helped by comparatively strong exports and quick action to keep the epidemic under control. However the global recession and the growing strength of the Taiwan dollar may push the central bank to cut rates again.
The strength of the Taiwan dollar will be one of the main concerns for the board, according to Yuanta Securities Invest Consulting chief economist Woods Chen, who predicts a 12.5 basis-point cut.
“The main rates for many of the world’s major economies are close to zero, meaning the Taiwan dollar is a high-interest rate currency,” he said. “Cutting the rate will at least reduce the incentive to speculate.”
Taiwan Central Bank Seen Reining in Currency at Two-Year High
In the past week, the central bank has repeatedly intervened in the currency market, according to traders, signaling its unease with the currency’s Asia-beating gain this year. It has been repeatedly active in the foreign exchange market in the last hour of trading since last Thursday as the Taiwan dollar closed in on a two-year high, according to currency traders in Taipei.
Angela Hsieh, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank Plc in Singapore, expects the central bank to cut its rate to 1% to avoid too much of a gap with other major Asian economies. She points to comments from central bank Governor Yang Chin-long calling for coordination of monetary and financial policies to have the greatest stimulatory impact. Hsieh views a rate cut in combination with the government’s plans for distributing vouchers to the public in July to stimulate consumption as the most effective way to shore up the economy.
Despite the fact that there was no lockdown and businesses and schools stayed open throughout the pandemic, private consumption may drop in this quarter after contracting in the first quarter, according to Hsieh. Unemployment has risen to 4.1%, its highest level in more than six years.
Worst Over?
Still, excessively high borrowing costs don’t appear to be the main problem constraining economic activity. Following its rate cut in March, the central bank also lowered the rates on its main policy tool -- short-term certificates of deposit it sells to commercial banks to regulate liquidity in the market. With the rate on the shortest 7-day notes currently at 0.11%, 15 of the 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg believe the central bank will keep the benchmark rate unchanged.
Having dodged the worst of the economic impact of the coronavirus and with liquidity still ample, Taiwan will likely wait to see if the global slump worsens before it cuts rates again, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. Economist Bansi Madhavani wrote in a report last week.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",U.S. homebuilding rises moderately; jump in permits hints at green shoots,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding increased less than expected in May, but a strong rebound in permits for future home construction suggested the housing market was starting to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis along with the broader economy.
Other data on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home surged to a near 11-1/2-year high last week. The reports followed on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a record surge in retail sales in May. Employers hired a historic 2.5 million workers last month. 
Activity, however, remains well below pre-COVID-19 levels and economists warn it could take even a decade for the economy to fully recover from the global pandemic. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also warned on Tuesday of the long road to recovery. The economy slipped into recession in February.
""Housing is a leading economic indicator and it is pointing the way forward but there is a limit to growth when the economy has to drag along the millions and millions of unemployed workers displaced in this pandemic recession who won't be seeing paychecks anytime soon,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Housing starts rose 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 974,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said. The increase recouped only a fraction of the more than 40% cumulative decline in homebuilding in March and April. Starts dropped 23.2% on a year-on-year basis in May.
The rise in starts last month was tempered by a 0.1% gain in single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, to a rate of 675,000 units. Steep decreases in homebuilding the Midwest and populous South offset robust increases in the West and Northeast.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment jumped 15.0% to a pace of 299,000 units. 
With starts still in a deep rut, economists expect a sharp decline in homebuilding in the second quarter, in line with projections for the steepest contraction in gross domestic product since the Great Depression. 
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP falling at 45.5% rate in the second quarter. The economy shrank at a 5% pace in the January-March quarter, the deepest contraction since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
""The drop in housing construction in the second-quarter GDP report is likely to be jaw-dropping,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower in volatile trading as a record rise in coronavirus cases in six states hurt sentiment after a three-day rally. The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RISING DEMAND
Permits for future home construction rebounded 14.4% to a rate of 1.220 million units in May, reinforcing economists' expectations that the housing market will lead the economy from the recession, driven by historically low mortgage rates. 
Though the housing market accounts for about 3.3% of gross domestic product, it has a larger footprint on the economy. 
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home increased 4% last week to their highest level since January 2009. 
Mortgage applications have climbed back above pre-COVID-19 levels. 
Signs of recovery in the housing market were underscored by a survey of Tuesday showing single-family homebuilders very upbeat in June about conditions in the industry. 
Builders reported increased demand for single-family homes in lower density neighborhoods. But with nearly 20 million unemployed and the resurgence of COVID-19 infections, the housing market is not out of the woods yet. 
""We expect a gradual recovery in home building to continue over the balance of 2020, supported by brightening homebuilder sentiment, solid demand, as evidenced by rising mortgage applications, and an ongoing shortage of inventory,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
""The slow recovery in the labor market will prevent a sharper rebound in activity.""
Single-family building permits increased 11.9% to a rate of 745,000 units in May. Permits for multi-family units surged 18.8% to a rate of 475,000 units.
Housing completions dropped 7.3% to a rate of 1.115 million units last month, the lowest since December 2018. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap, which has frustrated potential buyers. 

The stock of houses under construction fell 1.4% to 1,172 million units, the lowest since November 2019.

469,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Canada's May inflation rate falls 0.4% on lower gas prices,"By Julie Gordon and Kelsey Johnson
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate fell 0.4% in May, negative for the second month in row, as the COVID-19 pandemic pushed gasoline prices lower year-over-year, outweighing a jump in food costs, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
Excluding gasoline, the CPI rose 0.7%, the smallest increase since January 2013, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had forecast a flat rate of 0.0% in May, edging up from -0.2% recorded in April. 
""This was quite a bit weaker than expected. We did see the core measure fall,"" said Andrew Kelvin, Chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. ""That suggests there is still a little bit more slack in the economy than forecasters expected or hoped.""
Transportation prices, mainly lower gas prices compared with May 2019, contributed the most to the decline in the annual CPI. Food prices, meanwhile, posted the largest year-over-year increase among the major components.
The data comes a day after Tiff Macklem, the Bank of Canada's new governor, acknowledged that the consumer price index was not giving an accurate picture of inflation, as buying patterns have shifted due to COVID-19. 
He said the bank was working with Statistics Canada to ""get more representative figures to what Canadians are experiencing.""
Indeed, inflation has softened across many categories as job losses, shutdowns and border closures change how Canadians spend their money, and analysts say that deflationary pressure is likely to remain for an extended period.
""Retailers are needing to lower their prices to encourage consumers to come out a bit more and spend their money,"" said Josh Nye, senior economist at RBC.
The Canadian dollar shrugged off the data and was trading nearly unchanged at 1.3543 to the greenback, or 73.84 U.S. cents.

CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was at 1.4 percent.

The interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most popular U.S. home loan, dropped to 3.30% in the week ended June 12 from 3.38% the week before, the MBA said. Mortgage rates have dropped by around half a percentage point from earlier this year after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero to cushion the blow to the economy from the coronavirus pandemic.
Overall mortgage applications rose 8% last week on the back of the drop in lending rates, the MBA said. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home rose to an 11-year high, and refinancing applications increased 10% to the highest since late April.
""The housing market continues to experience the release of unrealized pent-up demand from earlier this spring, as well as a gradual improvement in consumer confidence,"" Joel Kan, MBA's Associate Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting, said in a statement.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which tracks data collected from public land registries to measure changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed prices were up 1.1% in May from April. 
Prices rose in eight of the 11 metropolitan areas in the index, with the national capital region of Ottawa-Gatineau up 2.2% and Toronto, Canada's most populous metropolitan area, gaining 2.1%.
Compared with the same month a year ago, the index climbed by 6%, its strongest pace since April 2018. It was the 10th consecutive month that the year-over-year gain accelerated, said Marc Pinsonneault, a senior economist at National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF).
Still, a couple of underlying numbers, such as a 22% year-over-year drop in the number of repeat sales used to derive indexes, showed signs of a slowdown in the housing market, Pinsonneault said.

Restrictive measures to combat the pandemic began to lift in Canada in May, but data from land registries could lag the timing of sales transactions.

Coming a day after data showed a record crash in April retail sales, the economy's incredibly weak start to the second quarter would appear to justify the expected cut in interest rates to a new low by the central bank later on Wednesday.
Services account for around 70% of Brazilian economic activity, and April reflected the first full month of strict coronavirus-linked policies restricting people's movement in key states like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
According to statistics agency IBGE, the level of service sector activity in Brazil is now 27% lower than the peak in November 2014.
The 11.7% month-on-month fall in April was more than the 10.5% drop forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the biggest fall since IBGE began the series in January 2011.
All five sectors surveyed by IBGE showed record declines in activity, with families-related services, which include hotels and restaurants, plunging 44.1% and transport and transport-related services falling 17.8%.
On an year-on-year basis, services sector activity in Brazil fell 17.2% in April, IBGE said, also a record and more than the 15.8% fall forecast in a Reuters poll.
The IBGE figures tally with IHS Markit's services purchasing managers index which fell to a record low 27.4 in April and remained at a depressed 27.6 in May, pointing to a deepening economic contraction.

The central bank is widely expected to cut its benchmark Selic interest rate by 75 basis points to a new all-time low of 2.25% on Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Haircuts, holidays and a pint at the pub remain off limits but prices for takeaway coffees, muffins and fitness classes have returned to Britain's inflation data, giving a picture of how the coronavirus lockdown is easing.
Headline year-on-year inflation was 0.5% in May, the lowest since 2016, but of equal interest was the insight into slowly normalising spending habits. 
With more cafes offering takeaway sales, statisticians were once again able to collect prices for slices of cake, muffins, tea and coffee to go. Slimming club memberships and exercise classes - mostly online - also became available in May.
In other signs of life returning to normal, Britain's Office for National Statistics was back to checking hourly rates of plumbers, electricians and decorators, as well as the cost of an annual booster injection for a medium-sized dog.
Even so, around one in seven of the prices that the ONS would normally check was unavailable last month. 
Most of the missing prices were in the travel and hospitality sectors, including beers, wine and spirits in pubs, as well as foreign travel and trips to cinemas, museums and bowling alleys.
For prices it cannot find, the ONS uses estimates based on trends a year ago. An alternative inflation measure, which strips out unavailable goods, showed inflation 0.1 percentage points lower than the headline measure in May.
Inflation has fallen sharply since the lockdown started. May's headline rate was a four-year low, largely due to a global fall in oil prices.
A fall in the cost of toys and games - after they spiked in April due to demand from families cooped up at home - also lowered inflation last month.

But food prices are rising, and it looks as if people snacking at home are partly to blame. Crisps, peanuts, chocolates and cakes were some of the items for which prices rose fastest in May.

(Reuters) - No denying May's $73 billion rebound in U.S. retail sales was an eye-popper and is the latest fodder to fuel the red-hot ""V"" vs ""U"" debate about what kind of recovery to expect from the COVID-19 recession.
Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has taken pains lately to caution everyone that this is likely to be a fitful and for many a painful recovery, called Tuesday's retail sales report from the Commerce Department an encouraging sign.
But, to be clear, while the rebound was strong overall, sales remain 8% below where they were in February, and many corners of retail are miles shy of where they were just three months ago when coast-to-coast stay-at-home orders brought many businesses to a full standstill.

Here is a look at some of the notable details from Tuesday's report: 
CARS AND TRUCKS
May's sales boom owes a lot to Detroit. Sales in the automotive sector - led by car and truck dealerships - rose by more than $30 billion from April, accounting for more than 40% of the overall retail sales increase.

EVERYONE HAS A PROJECT
With everyone spending more time at home, Americans also decided to spend more money on their homes. Sales at home and garden centers surged to a record high last month, and are one of just three major retail categories up from a year earlier, the others being grocery stores and online retailers.

HOW PUZZLING
The anecdotes about jigsaw puzzle shortages have been circulating for months, but May's sales resurgence in the sporting goods, hobby, musical instruments and bookstore category shows this was no myth. Bicycles, home fitness gear and good, old books are also in high demand.

CLOTHING - BOTTOM OF THE RACK
Clothing retailers notched the largest percentage increase in May - a stunning 188%. Impressive until the low base is taken into account. Sales are still just a third of February's level.

Speaking at a conference run by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Kotyakov said the domestic labour market had made it through the peak of the coronavirus pandemic better than a number of other countries.
He said the domestic labour market was expected to begin its recovery in the fourth quarter.
Russia has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, with more than 550,000 infections.
Moscow, the area of Russia worst affected by the outbreak, last week began lifting a lockdown that had been in place for more than two months.

More costly food, alcohol and tobacco added 0.64 percentage points to the final year-on-year reading for May, more expensive services added another 0.59 point and industrial goods added 0.06 point, but a plunge in energy prices subtracted 1.20 point.
Excluding the most volatile elements of energy and unprocessed food prices -- what the European Central Bank calls core inflation -- prices were flat month-on-month and rose 1.2% year-on-year in May, accelerating from 1.1% in April.
An even narrower measure often looked at by financial markets which also excludes changes in prices of alcohol and tobacco, was also flat month-on-month and unchanged from April at 0.9% growth year-on-year.

The ECB wants to keep the overall headline inflation below, but close to 2% over the medium term.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell in May at the fastest pace since the 2009 global financial crisis as U.S.-bound car shipments plunged, bolstering expectations for a deeper contraction in the world's third-largest economy this quarter.
Weak global appetite for cars and slowing business spending could drag on Japan's export-led economy, as China-bound trade remains weak, dashing hopes mainland demand could offset the weakness seen in other major trading partners.
Official data out Wednesday showed Japan's exports fell 28.3% in the year to May, the largest slump since September 2009. The result was worse than a 26.1% decrease expected in a Reuters poll and extended double-digit declines for a third straight month.
U.S.-bound exports - Japan's key market - halved to mark the biggest annual drop since March 2009, due to more than 70% declines in shipments of cars and car parts. Japan is the world's second-largest exporter of autos.
""As Europe and America started to re-open, exports may have hit the bottom in May,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""That said, as new cases of infections have risen in Beijing, it's hard to expect a steady recovery. If such a situation drags on, it will deal a body blow to small firms, raising the risk of rising bankruptcies and jobless in the latter half of the fiscal year.""
U.S.-bound exports fell to 588 billion yen ($5.48 billion), the lowest since February 2009, shrinking Japan's trade surplus with the United States to 10 billion yen, the smallest since records began in January 1979.
The plunge in U.S.-bound auto exports weighed on Japan's automaker stocks with Mazda Motor (T:7261), Hino Motors (T:7205) and Isuzu Motors (T:7202) all losing more than 4%.
While recent indicators suggest the U.S. economy is emerging from the depths of its coronavirus slump, businesses are still dealing with the effects of travel and social distancing restrictions.
Globally, automakers are struggling to recover from heavy lockdowns in many countries that pummelled demand for cars. Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. (T:7201) has announced plans to slash production capacity and its model range by about a fifth to help cut costs, following a slide in sales.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, fell 1.9% in the year to May, due to declines in chemical raw materials, cars and chip-making equipment. It followed the prior month's 4% annual decline.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese exports, declined 12%, and exports to the European Union also fell 33.8%.
Japan's economy slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the first quarter and is on course for its deepest postwar slump as the pandemic ravages businesses and consumers.
The Bank of Japan on Tuesday increased its support through lending schemes for struggling businesses to $1 trillion, following government efforts to stop the economy from sliding deeper in recession with $2.2 trillion fiscal stimulus packages.
While the central bank expects a gradual economic recovery in the second half, the collapse in trade and bleak sentiment surveys suggest industries have a long way to go to make a sustained comeback.
Analysts warn the current quarter will be especially dire as consumers stayed at home and businesses closed their doors.
Highlighting the pain the health crisis has inflicted on corporate morale, manufacturers' confidence fell to its lowest level in 11 years, the Reuters Tankan survey showed on Wednesday.
Reflecting weak domestic demand as well as the collapse in crude oil prices, overall imports fell 26.2% in the year to May, the biggest drop since October 2009, the trade data showed.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Business sentiment of Asian companies sank to an 11-year low in the second quarter, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey found, with some two-thirds of the firms polled flagging a worsening COVID-19 pandemic as the biggest risk over the next six months.
While the pandemic's initial impact was reflected in the March survey, confidence during the June quarter fell by a third to 35, only the second time the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS> has slumped below 50 since the survey began in the second quarter of 2009.
A reading above 50 indicates a positive outlook. The last time the index showed a reading below that was in its debut quarter, when it hit 45.
About 16% of the 93 companies surveyed also said a deepening recession was a key risk for the next six months, with more than half expecting staffing levels and business volumes to decline.
""We ran this survey right at the edge when things were getting really bad,"" Antonio Fatas, Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD, said of the survey conducted between May 29 and June 12.
""We can see this complete pessimism which is spread across sectors and countries in a way that we haven't seen before."" 
Many countries are easing coronavirus-related lockdowns but worries have mounted that another wave of infections could hurt economies that have been battered from weeks of curbs on travel and movement. Cases globally have crossed 8 million.
After weeks with almost no new coronavirus infections, China recorded dozens of new cases in recent days, roiling fragile equity markets. South Korea too faces an uptick after early successful containment.
Companies from 11 Asia-Pacific countries responded to the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey . 
Participants included Thai hospitality group Minor International (BK:MINT), Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269), Taiwanese contract manufacturer  Wistron Corp  (TW:3231) and Australia-listed Oil Search (AX:OSH).

NO V-SHAPED RECOVERY
China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected, reported that industrial output quickened for a second straight month in May, but a weaker-than-expected gain suggested that recovery remained fragile.
""It tells us that the recovery will take time and it won't be a V-shaped recovery,"" said Jeff Ng, senior treasury strategist at HL Bank.
Governments have rolled out stimulus measures to support ailing economies. Singapore and Hong Kong, among the most open economies in Asia, have backed sectors such as airlines that are bearing the brunt of travel restrictions.
Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would likely hold its benchmark interest rate near zero through 2022, signalling it expects a long road to recovery.
But recessions in most major economies are still expected to be more severe this year than forecast, Reuters polls of more than 250 economists published in late May show.
Chaiyapat Paitoon, chief strategy officer at Minor International (MINT), that operates brands such as Marriott and Four Seasons and gets the bulk of its revenue from Europe, said the company had taken several cost-saving measures to minimise the impact on its profits. 
""MINT's main priorities are to survive, stabilize, and grow,"" Paitoon said.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said it expects a macro shift in the aftermath of the pandemic.
""Every big slowdown leaves a mark on macro balance sheets. The significant fiscal easing undertaken means that ratios of public sector debt to gross domestic product are likely to rise over the next two years,"" Morgan Stanley economists said in a recent report.
""When the going gets good, policymakers will need to delever to renew policy space.""

480,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 12:01PM ET</span>",U.S. economy starts long recovery as retail sales post record jump,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased by the most on record in May after two straight months of sharp declines as businesses reopened, offering more evidence that the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic was over or drawing to an end.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday followed news early this month that the economy created 2.5 million jobs in May. Layoffs are also ebbing and manufacturing activity is improving, though production remains at very low levels. 
The surge in retail sales last month recouped 63% of March and April's decreases. But the journey to recovery could be long and difficult as some parts of the country are experiencing a resurgence of COVID-19 infections. In addition, enhanced federal government unemployment checks will run out in July.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that ""until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.""
Retail sales jumped 17.7% last month, the biggest advance since the government started tracking the series in 1992. Sales dropped a record 14.7% in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 8% in May.
Retail sales fell 6.1% on a year-on-year basis in May. Even with May's surge, sales were still about 8% below their February level, leaving consumer spending and the economy on track for their biggest contraction in the second quarter since the Great Depression. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
""The economy and retail sales have hit the bottom in May and we have a V-shaped first stage of recovery,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""However, it will take quite some time to get back to anywhere near the levels of retail sales and economic activity we enjoyed around the turn of the year.""
The reopening last month of nonessential businesses that were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19 has seen Americans flocking to car dealerships and spending more on gasoline, apparel and at restaurants.
Though nearly 20 million people have lost their jobs to the pandemic, record savings and the government's historic fiscal package of nearly $3 trillion are providing a cushion for consumers through one-time $1,200 checks and generous unemployment benefits. The unprecedented economic upheaval saw personal savings increasing at a record $337 billion in April and the saving rate hitting an all-time high of 33%.
MANUFACTURING STABILIZING
The recovery in retail sales last month was led by a 44.1% acceleration in sales at auto dealerships.
Receipts at service stations increased 12.8%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores soared 50.5%. Receipts at clothing stores rebounded 188% last month. Still, clothing store sales remained about 63% below their February level. 
Sales at furniture stores soared 89.7%. Receipts at restaurants and bars advanced 29.1%. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores vaulted 88.2%. All these categories had suffered record declines in sales in March and April.
Online and mail-order retail sales rose 9.0%. Sales at building material stores rose 10.9%. 
The surge in demand for motor vehicles helped to lift manufacturing production 3.8% in May, a separate report from the Fed showed on Tuesday, after collapsing by a record 15.5% in April. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy, remains hobbled by supply-chain disruptions. 
Cheaper crude oil has made oil and gas wells unprofitable, impacting demand for heavy equipment and machinery.
""We expect a gradual recovery over the next few years, with growth lagging that of the overall economy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""One potential upside risk is if firms decide to shorten their supply chains because of the pandemic and the associated disruptions to global trade, moving manufacturing capacity back to the U.S.""
Stocks on Wall Street rallied on the reports and data showing reduced COVID-19 death rates in a trial of a generic steroid drug. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales surged 11% in May after tumbling 12.4% in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the gross domestic product report.
Economists expect consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, could decline at as much as a 37% annualized rate in the second quarter. That could result in GDP falling at around a 36% pace in that period.
Consumer spending contracted at a 6.8% rate in the first quarter, the sharpest drop since the second quarter of 1980. The economy shrank at a 5% pace in the January-March quarter, the deepest contraction since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.

Weak GDP this quarter was underscored by other data on Tuesday showing a tumble in business inventories in April.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday business inventories dropped 1.3% in April after falling 0.3% in March. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast business stocks decreasing 0.8% in April. 
Retail inventories plunged 3.7% in April, instead of 3.3% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.1% increase in March.
Motor vehicle inventories dived 8.4% rather than 8.3% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, fell 1.1% as reported last month.
A drawdown of inventories contributed to GDP shrinking at a 5.0% annualized rate in the first quarter, the sharpest pace of contraction since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared last week that the economy slipped into recession in February. Inventory investment has subtracted from GDP for four straight quarters. The drag in recent quarters reflects declining imports, which have been depressed by the White House's trade war with China and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Goods imports tumbled to more than a nine-year low in April.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.3% in April. Stocks at manufacturers fell 0.4% in April.

Business sales plummeted 14.4% in April after declining 5.2% in the prior month. At April's sales pace, it would take 1.67 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.45 months in March.

Activity in the service sector, which has been severely affected by stay-at-home orders and shutdowns aimed at containing the new coronavirus, declined at a slower pace in June than it did in April and May, the survey https://www.newyorkfed.org/survey/business_leaders/bls_overview of business leaders showed.

A gauge of builder sentiment jumped to 58, a 21-point gain from May, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index. Analysts expected a reading of about 46, the average of 37 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. A rating above 50 is considered positive. June’s increase was the biggest on record for the index and followed a seven-point uptick in May.
“Builders report increasing demand for families seeking single-family homes in inner and outer suburbs that feature lower-density neighborhoods,” NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz said in a statement. “At the same time, elevated unemployment and the risk of new, local virus outbreaks remain a risk to the housing market.”
Demand for new homes has bounced back despite the economic damage of the pandemic, sending an index of homebuilder stocks up 98% through Monday from this year’s March 23 nadir.
More than two-thirds of recent home buyers cited Covid-19 as the reason for purchasing now, according to a survey released June 12 by John Burns Real Estate Consulting. The buyers listed low rates, dislike of their current home layout and desire for a larger house as their pandemic-related motivations, according to the poll of 5,000 buyers.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian retail sales plunged at a record pace in April as social isolation measures choked spending, official figures showed on Tuesday, indicating the economy's contraction in the second quarter could be even more severe than anticipated.
Sales excluding autos and construction materials fell 16.8% in April from March and from the same month a year ago, statistics agency IBGE said on Tuesday, reflecting the first full month of social isolation and quarantine measures.
Both were steeper than the 11.9% monthly decline and 13.6% annual fall forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. IBGE said that level of sales is now its lowest since the series began in 2000 and down 22.7% from the peak in October 2014.
""Taken together with the industrial production figures, they point to a fall in overall economic activity of somewhere in the region of 15-20% in April,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics. 
""But just as importantly, the economy seems to be really slow to recover. Output probably remained at very depressed levels in May and June, pointing to a larger fall in GDP in Q2,"" he said.
Brazil's economy is expected to shrink at a record annual pace this year of more than 6%, with the second-quarter posting the biggest decline due to the coronavirus crisis.
The sectors hardest hit in April were clothing and footwear, which saw a 60.6% fall in sales; books, magazines and newspapers, which sank 43.4%; and other personal and domestic goods, which fell 29.5% on the month, IBGE said.
Supermarket, food, drink and tobacco sales fell 11.8%, and pharmacy, medical and cosmetics sales fell 17%, IBGE said.

On a wider measure, including autos and construction materials, retail sales in Latin America's largest economy fell 17.5% on the month and 27.1% on the year, IBGE said. Both were record declines.

A ZEW gauge of current conditions in Germany advanced in June, and expectations for the next six months continued to improve. The data underscore hopes that the economy will grow again in the second half of 2020.
The country’s government has made more than 1.3 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion) in stimulus available to encourage spending and keep struggling businesses afloat. While that hasn’t prevented numerous insolvencies and hundreds of thousands of lob losses, the Bundesbank said earlier this month that Germany had probably already passed the trough of its deepest postwar slump.
Still, the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to be muted as some restrictions to rein in the spread of the disease remain in place. Output this year is forecast to shrink more than 7%, according to Bundesbank projections, before regaining ground in the subsequent two years.
“There is growing confidence that the economy will bottom out by summer 2020,” ZEW President Achim Wambach said. “Financial market experts continue to expect only a slow increase in economic value added in the third and fourth quarters.”
On a regional level, ZEW’s report showed that investor expectations for the wider euro area have also improved.
European Union leaders are gathering this week to discuss a proposed 750 billion-euro package to revive the economy with grants and loans. European Central Bank Executive Board member Fabio Panetta praised the initiative in an interview published Tuesday and encouraged quick decisions.
“It is extremely urgent and the aim should be to deploy it as soon as possible, no later than early 2021,” he told Le Monde. “European authorities have shown a remarkable awareness of the need to intervene. I remain optimistic.”

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people on British company payrolls fell by more than 600,000 in April and May as the coronavirus lockdown hit the labour market, and vacancies plunged by the most on record, official data showed on Tuesday.
The jobless rate unexpectedly held at 3.9% over the three months to April - despite a record slump in overall economic output during that period - as firms turned to the government's job retention scheme to keep employees on their books.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly expected a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.7%.
""The furlough scheme continues to hold off the bulk of job losses, but unemployment is likely to surge in the months ahead,"" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said.
The furlough scheme is due to run until the end of October although employers have to make contributions to the cost of paying their temporarily laid-off workers from August.
Many companies have already announced permanent layoffs of workers. On Monday, building materials firm  Travis Perkins  (LON:TPK) said it would cut about 9% of its workforce, or 2,500 jobs. Airlines have shed more than 15,000 jobs in Britain.
Britain's job market was strong before the coronavirus hit, and the ONS said many of those who lost their jobs in April were not actively looking for work and so counted as 'inactive' rather than unemployed.
In a more up-to-date sign of how the coronavirus lockdown is affecting the labour market, experimental figures, based on tax data, showed the number of people on company payrolls fell by 612,000 in April and May. In May alone, it was 163,000 lower than in April when the biggest job losses occurred.
That left the number of paid employees 2.1% lower than in March, the ONS said.
There was also a big drop in job vacancies which showed their largest quarterly fall since the ONS began measuring them in 2001, with a slide of 342,000 to 476,000.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, under pressure to ease the slump in the economy, has ordered a review of Britain's two-metre social distancing rule which many employers say is stopping them from getting back up to speed.
Johnson and finance minister Rishi Sunak are also reportedly considering increasing a tax incentive for small firms to hire workers, and suspending social security payments by employers.
The ONS said the number of hours worked per week dropped by the biggest amount on record, falling to 959.9 million in the three months to April from 1.041 billion in the three months to March, reflecting the scale of the jobs furlough scheme which covers about 9 million jobs.
A measure of the number of people claiming Universal Credit, a benefit for people out of work or on low incomes, rose by a larger than expected 528,900 in May to 2.8 million, more than double the number in March.
The ONS has said the claimant count almost certainly overstates the rise in unemployment because it includes people who are in work but are entitled to support.
A fall in pay growth reflected how workers on the government's job retention scheme are only entitled to receive 80% of their former pay, up to 2,500 pounds a month.

The ONS said workers' total pay growth of 1.0% was the weakest since September 2014. Regular pay, excluding bonuses, grew by 1.7%, the weakest since January 2015.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Bidding wars and buoyant starts: Canada's housing market is not buckling under the double-shock of COVID-19 and slumping oil prices, which have crippled the country's economy and led to a record-high unemployment rate.
Home sales rebounded 56.9% in May from the previous month, the weakest April on record, the Canadian Real Estate Association said on Monday. Prices were up 5.3% year-over-year and flat with April, as new listings have plunged, keeping supply tight in many markets.
This follows surprisingly buoyant housing starts released last week, as construction clawed back from April shutdowns. 
For Tina Dang and Alex Kean, the COVID-19 pandemic seemed a good time to buy a house in Toronto. But they saw three homes sell in bidding wars in the past month.
""You see headlines all the time saying housing sales are plummeting due to COVID,"" said Dang. ""But it's pretty shocking ... we're still in multiple-offers territory.""
Still, economists warn cracks are coming. Immigration, the top driver of new household growth in Canada, has plunged. The short-term rental market has vanished, and falling long-term rents change the outlook for investor owners.
""I can recognize in the short term that prices are sticky and the market psychology has yet to change,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.
""But when I look a few months out, particularly when some of these mortgage deferrals start to wind down ... the market could hit a soft patch.""
Indeed, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation last month said home prices could fall as much as 18% from peak levels amid COVID-19 declines in output, employment and immigration.
Falling prices could sour the picture for many condo investors, who were banking on price gains to offset low CAP rental rates, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

""If the economics stop making sense ... that could force some investors to flip those condos back onto the resale market,"" he said.

The regional Fed bank's Empire State Manufacturing Index surged 48 points to a reading of negative 0.2 from negative 48.5 in May. Economists polled by Reuters were looking for a reading of negative 29.8, according to the survey median.
The report is among several recent readings that point to at least a stabilization in U.S. economic activity after it had been torpedoed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the social-distancing measures taken to contain its spread.
The U.S. economy fell into recession in February, and while the months ahead may continue to show sharp improvements from the worst levels in April and May, Fed officials expect the recovery overall to be long and uneven.
(GRAPHIC - Empire State COVID-19 bounce back: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzqowxvw/Pasted%20image%201592231313580.png)
The New York Fed said 36% of respondents reported improved conditions in June, although an equal percentage reported poorer conditions. The new orders index rose 42 points to near zero, indicating the quantity of orders was unchanged from last month, while shipments increased slightly.
The survey's forward-looking indicators all improved sharply. 

The index for future business conditions rose 27 points to 56.5, its highest level since October 2009. The indexes for future new orders and future shipments also posted significant increases. The index for future employment rose to 19, the highest since August, suggesting firms expect to increase employment in the months ahead.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian manufacturing sales plummeted a record-breaking 28.5% in April as the coronavirus pandemic hit business operations, Statistics Canada said on Monday, but analysts and the agency predicted the figures should improve in May.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a decline of 20% in April. Statistics Canada revised its March figure down to a 9.8% decline from an initial drop of 9.2%.
""This is a much deeper hole than initially expected, and could take even longer for the sector to dig out of than initially expected,"" CIBC Senior Economist Royce Mendes said in a note.
All 21 industries monitored by Statistics Canada reported declines, while over four-fifths of manufacturers said the coronavirus pandemic had affected their operations. In volume terms, sales plunged a record 26.0%.
Many manufacturers resumed production in May as Canada's 10 provinces began to gradually restart their economies, which is ""expected to bolster sales compared with April,"" Statscan said.
""April should prove the low point for Canadian manufacturing as easing of physical distancing measures allowed some factories to reopen or increase capacity,"" said Josh Nye, senior economist with RBC.
Sales in the transportation equipment industry fell by 76.4% in April, the largest decrease on record. The slump was led by sharp declines in the motor vehicle and motor vehicle parts industries, which plunged 97.5% and 88.1% respectively.
Declines were also reported in the petroleum and coal product industries, which fell for the fourth consecutive month. Statscan said sales declined a record 46.4% in April as refineries curtailed production in response to weaker demand.
Food sales were also hit, dropping 12.8% in April, following a 9.9% gain in March, in part because of shutdowns at some meat processing plants after outbreaks of COVID-19 were reported among some plant employees.

Statscan's current data series began in 1992.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general business conditions index advanced to minus 0.2 from minus 48.5 a month earlier, a report out Monday showed. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for the overall gauge to improve to minus 29.6. Firms also grew more optimistic about future conditions.
A reading of zero is the dividing line between expansion and contraction and the measure in April dropped to an all-time low of minus 78.2. The Empire State report is the first of several regional Fed manufacturing indexes to be released this month.
The bank’s gauges of orders and employment climbed in June, while a measure of shipments picked up to a four-month high.
New York manufacturers also grew more upbeat about economic conditions over the next six months, with the regional Fed bank’s future index advancing to 56.5, the highest since October 2009. Measures of the outlooks for capital outlays and technology spending also showed expansion.
The report also contained good news for factory workers as more firms said they planned to add employees in the months ahead. The future employment index increased to 19 in June, the highest level in almost a year.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factories stepped up production for a second straight month in May, as the country shook off the economic torpor of the coronavirus, although the weaker-than-expected gain suggested the recovery remained fragile.
Patchy data on Monday also showed sustained contractions in retail sales and investment, a sign many sectors were still struggling with the effects of heavy shutdowns across the world's second-largest economy earlier this year.
Global leaders are closely watching China to see how long it takes to get back on its feet as they begin to relax their own stringent anti-virus measures and reboot their economies.
Analysts say signs of improvement continue to be seen in China from increased steel production and car sales to more industrial parks restarting. However, concerns about a second wave of infections are now casting a dark cloud over recovery prospects.
""Industrial production is on the whole getting better, but there are still quite a few difficulties and uncertainties,"" said Jiang Yuan, an official at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in a statement.
Industrial output growth quickened to 4.4% in May from a year earlier, the highest reading since December, official data showed on Monday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 5.0% rise from 3.9% in April, the first expansion since the virus emerged in China late last year.
But a collapse in export orders amid global lockdowns has left factories more reliant on domestic demand, which is recovering at a more sluggish pace.
Retail sales fell for a fourth straight month. While the 2.8% drop was smaller than the 7.5% slump in April, it was larger than the 2.0% fall tipped by analysts. Heavy job losses and fears of a second infection wave have kept consumers cautious.
""There are still restrictions in some demand areas, people remain worried and not many are traveling or going to cinemas, plus there are some virus flare-ups, which will have some impact on consumption,"" said Tang Jianwei, senior economist at Bank of Communications in Shanghai.
Fixed asset investment fell 6.3% in January-May from the same period last year, compared with a forecast 5.9% fall and a 10.3% decline in the first four months of the year.
As in past downturns, Beijing is banking on higher infrastructure spending to lead a recovery, and steel mills have cranked up furnaces to over 92% of capacity.
Private sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for 60% of total investment, fell 9.6% in January-May, compared with a 13.3% decline in the first four months of the year.
Other data showed real estate investment fell 0.3% in January-May from a year earlier, far less than in previous months.
GROWTH FORECASTS
China's gross domestic product shrank 6.8% in the first quarter, the first contraction on record. Highlighting the uncertain outlook, the government did not set a GDP growth target at its annual parliament gathering in May, the first time in nearly two decades it has not done so.
The NBS said China's economy has not yet returned to normal and external risks have clearly increased. China would need to see further recovery in June for the economy to eke out an expansion in the current quarter, it added.
Some analysts saw May's factory data pointing to a more optimistic outlook than previously feared. Bank of Communications' Tang now expects China's GDP to return to modest growth in the second quarter, helped by the recovery in property investment.
However, others still see risks as fragile employment weighs on consumption. ING economists maintained their forecasts for GDP to fall 3.1% in the second quarter and 1.5% in 2020.
""We believe that the unstable job market and healthcare concerns are the main factors slowing down the recovery,"" said ING Chief Economist Greater China Iris Pang. ""This means that even during the long holiday month of May, people were still spending carefully.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Real estate investment and sales in China both quickened in May, pointing to continuing momentum as the property sector gradually recovers from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The property market is a key driver of growth in the world's second-largest economy, and was among many segments of the economy hit hard by the coronavirus crisis and tough containment measures.
Real estate investment in May rose 8.1% from a year earlier, up from 7% growth the previous month, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday.
For the first five months of the year, property investment fell 0.3% on year, far less than in previous months as the economy begins to slowly emerge from its coronavirus shutdown.
Consumption remains soft, however, amid job losses and concerns about the risk of a second wave of infection.
Property sales by floor area jumped 9.7% in May, the fastest pace since July 2018 and compared with a 2.1% fall in April.
New construction starts measured by floor area rose 2.5% last month, compared with a 1.3% drop in April.
Funds raised by China's property developers fell 6.1% in the January-May period, compared with a 10.4% % drop for the first four months of 2020.
""May data showed that the impact from the epidemic has gone and China's property market will continue to heat up going forward,"" said Zhang Dawei, a Beijing-based analyst with property agency Centaline.
Separately, China's average new home prices in 70 major cities rose 0.5% in May from the prior month, matching the pace in April, Reuters calculations showed.
On an annual basis, home prices expanded 4.9% in May, slightly less than April's 5.1% pace.

Beijing still refrains from using the real estate sector as short-term stimulus, even as the economy struggles to recover from its first contraction in decades in the first quarter.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2020 07:35PM ET</span>",English property sales rebound after lockdown ends: Rightmove,"LONDON (Reuters) - Estate agents in England have seen a rebound in house sales since the government eased coronavirus lockdown restrictions on May 13, property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said on Monday.
Rightmove said sales during the lockdown fell by 94%. By June 5 sales were just 3% below their level a year earlier, while over the previous three weeks they averaged two thirds of their previous level.
""There are signs of high pent-up demand and upwards price pressure, rather than downwards,"" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said.
Average asking prices for properties on the site were 1.9% higher than before the lockdown. For properties where a sale had been agreed, the accepted price was 98% of the asking price, slightly higher than in February.
The figures do not cover Scotland or Wales, where coronavirus restrictions on property sales are tighter.
Rightmove's site is used to market the majority of British residential property.
Zoopla, another property website, reported a similar picture last week, though it warned that the surge in demand may not last through 2020, especially if more people lose jobs when temporary government support measures end.
Nonetheless, the figures add to signs from other business surveys of a resumption of activity in sectors where lockdown restrictions have been relaxed.
A further key test will begin this week, when shops selling non-essential goods reopen to the public.

Official data last week showed the economy suffered a historic collapse during the lockdown in March and April, with activity down by a quarter on normal levels, a far bigger fall than in the financial crisis.

500,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 14, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",Next U.S. Jobs Report Set to Be Even More Confusing Than May’s,"(Bloomberg) -- If you thought the U.S. jobs report for May was confusing, June’s could be even worse.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes the widely-watched monthly figures on the world’s largest economy, is taking additional steps to solve data-collection issues that since March have resulted in an official unemployment rate that appears to understate the true scale of joblessness in America during the coronavirus pandemic.
Fixing one problem may create another, though: The official June jobless rate would be tricky to compare with May’s. And if the unemployed are counted properly, it could very well result in an increase in the official rate from the previous month -- even if the reality is that joblessness fell in June, as many economists expect.
Here’s what happened: While the official unemployment rate posted a surprise drop last month, to 13.3% from 14.7%, the BLS said the May figure, when adjusted for data errors, would have been 16.4%. The problem stemmed from respondents misunderstanding questions, or survey-takers failing to properly code many people as unemployed while temporarily laid off. Instead, many people seem to have been misclassified as being employed but not at work due to other reasons, which is assumed to reflect the pandemic.
The official unemployment rates for different demographic groups -- African Americans as well as white, Hispanic and Asian workers -- have all likely been understated as well. For April, the unemployment rate would have been 19.5% when adjusted for the error, according to BLS.
Serious Confusion
So if the data issue is solved in June and millions of workers are moved from the employed category to the unemployed one, but the labor market in reality improves, the official rate might appear to increase from 13.3% in May to, for example, 15% in June -- when the more appropriate comparison might be to the BLS’s adjusted May rate of 16.4%.
It all has the potential to create serious confusion in financial markets and in politics as well. People who say the unemployment rate rose could cite May’s official rate, and people who say it declined could reference May’s unofficial rate. As President Donald Trump looks to highlight additional signs of an economic rebound after falling behind 2020 Democratic challenger Joe Biden in polls, the numbers are taking on extra importance.
The BLS will “report what the official unemployment rate did, without taking into account the misclassification,” Julie Hatch Maxfield, the agency’s associate commissioner for employment and unemployment statistics, said in an interview on Friday. “We won’t be able to quantify the difference between just general labor-market changes and changes due to the enhanced training” of survey-takers.
Read More:
However it’s sliced, the BLS is likely to face obstacles in explaining to the general public what’s actually happening.
“We will try to be as transparent as possible for the reasons that we believe the change occurred,” Maxfield said.
The challenges with the unemployment rate may put extra focus on the payroll figures, released at the same time and derived from a separate monthly survey of businesses and government agencies. That survey isn’t susceptible to the misclassification error.
“The real issue comes is if we get divergent signals from these two surveys,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). A closer look will be needed to answer the question: Is it due to the misclassification, or is it potentially due to something else?
Don’t Go Changing
Part of the problem stems from BLS’s policy of not changing any survey responses after the fact. And while the agency can estimate the number of misclassified workers, it’s impossible to actually know.
The rigidity and consistency of the statistical process is part of what gives BLS’s numbers a reliable reputation. But that rigidity could ultimately mean the figures for recent months carry a permanent asterisk in the record books. That would leave open the question of how high the unemployment rate really went during the pandemic’s most intense period of job losses.
“This is a messy situation. It will always be messy,” said Erica Groshen, a former BLS commissioner. “It’s undeniably awkward and we just have to chalk it up to one more” impact of Covid-19.
Further complicating the June payroll figures is what’s expected to be a weaker response rate due to a shorter survey period of 10 business days. The June report will be released on Thursday, July 2, a day earlier than usual due to the Independence Day holiday being observed on July 3. In any given month, the collection period can range from 10 to 16 days.
Response rates have been lower during the pandemic, particularly for the household survey, which informs the unemployment rate. Maxfield nevertheless expressed confidence in the figures’ reliability now and over coming months.
“Even though response rates are lower, they’re still significantly higher than a lot of other surveys out there so thankfully we have a bigger cushion,” Maxfield said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy shed 344,526 formal jobs in May because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, pushing the number of lost jobs in the last three months above 1 million even as the pace of layoffs slowed down.
Widespread confinement measures in place since late March have ravaged Mexico's economy, second largest in Latin America. Economists predicted it would suffer its biggest recession in decades.
In April, the economy shed 555,247 jobs and 130,593 in March, among employees registered with the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS).
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sought to play down the severity of the economic hit and previously said fewer than a million formal jobs would be lost to the pandemic.
But just three months into the health crisis in Mexico and that threshold has already been passed with losses from March to May totalling 1.03 million.
Those figures don't include the informal sector, which represents 56% of all jobs in Mexico.
The government had planned an unwinding from anti-coronavirus measures and broad economic reopening to start from June 1, but surging deaths and infections have kept nearly the entire country in the highest red phase of contagion alert, dampening expectations for major changes.
That spells bad news for jobs, especially for the 31 million Mexicans working in the informal sector.

""The crisis exacerbates inequity and the critical employment conditions for those who have the least,"" said economist Jose Luis de la Cruz.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer confidence rises; COVID-19, unemployment shadow lingers","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment perked up in early June as households cheered the reopening of businesses and a surprise rebound in hiring, though they did not expect a significant improvement in the economy amid fears of a resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
The survey from the University of Michigan on Friday is broadly in line with economists' expectations that the recovery from the recession would be a long slog. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared on Monday that the economy slipped into recession in February.
""While uncertainty about the future is beginning to ease, it is still higher than it was at anytime during the Great Recession,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""That raises questions about the willingness to purchase big-ticket items. If we don't see that happen, the recovery will be slower than hoped for.""
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased to a reading of 78.9 from 72.3 in May. It said ""few consumers anticipate the reestablishment of favorable economic conditions anytime soon."" Two-thirds of consumers in the survey expected ""bad times financially"" during the year ahead, while half anticipated a ""renewed downturn.""
In addition to concerns about a second wave of COVID-19 infections, consumers also worried that persistently high unemployment could slow the economic recovery. Though the economy created 2.5 million jobs in May, an employment gap of nearly 20 million remains since March when nonessential businesses were shuttered to slow the spread of COVID-19.
Layoffs are more than double their peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the sentiment index would rise to 75 early this month.
While the University of Michigan survey showed consumers' inflation expectations easing slightly in June, they remained above their pre-COVID-19 shutdown levels. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations slipped to 3.0% from 3.2% in May. Five-year inflation expectations dipped to 2.6% this month from 2.7%.
Consumers' inflation perceptions in the past months have been driven by higher food prices, amid meat shortages caused by COVID-19 outbreaks at processing plants.
""That provides some reassurance that the recent plunge in prices for travel-sensitive services like airline fares and motor vehicle insurance will not lead to a more widespread period of falling prices,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, recouping about half of the previous session's sharp losses. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
IMPORT PRICES RISE
Deflation fears were further assuaged by a separate report from the Labor Department on Friday showing import prices rose 1.0% in May, the largest gain since February 2019, after falling 2.6% in April. Import prices, which exclude tariffs, were driven by higher costs for petroleum products and food.
The government reported this week consumer prices falling moderately in May and a solid rebound in producer prices. Deflation is a decline in the general price level, which is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
""These gains should support June increases for CPI and PPI,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. ""Trade prices should rise further in June with oil prices, alongside a lift from a drop-back in the value of the dollar, though we have an ongoing headwind from demand destruction with global shutdowns.""
The Federal Reserve, which tracks the core personal consumption expenditures price index for its 2% inflation target, sharply lowered its inflation projections on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank projected core inflation rising 1.0% this year and picking up to 1.5% in 2021. Back in December, it forecast inflation at 1.9% this year and 2% in 2021.
In May, prices for imported fuels and lubricants surged 20.5% after declining 31.0% in the prior month. Petroleum prices jumped 21.7% after plunging 32.6% in April. Imported food prices rebounded 2.2% last month after dropping 1.6% in April.
Excluding fuels, import prices gained 0.1% following a 0.5% drop in April. The cost of goods imported from China was unchanged in May. Prices declined 1.0% year-on-year, the smallest drop since March 2019.
The government also reported that export prices rose 0.5% in May as higher prices for nonagricultural products offset lower prices for agricultural goods. That followed a 3.3% drop in April. Export prices fell 6.0% on a year-on-year.
Prices for agricultural exports declined 0.5%, pulled down by weaker prices for corn, dairy products and soybeans. That more than offset higher prices for meat, vegetables and cotton. Agricultural export prices fell 3.5% year-on-year.

Nonagricultural export prices rose 0.6%, boosted by higher prices for industrial supplies and materials, which overcame decreases in prices for capital goods, consumer goods, automotive vehicles, and nonagricultural foods.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank by a quarter over March and April as entire sectors were shuttered by the coronavirus lockdown, in what looks likely to be the bottom of a ""catastrophic"" crash before a long and slow recovery.
In a slump dwarfing previous downturns, the economy contracted by 20.4% in April from March, when it shrank by nearly 6%. It was 24.5% smaller than in April 2019.
Both of April's readings represented bigger declines than the unprecedentedly weak forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. The Office for National Statistics said the economy had shrunk back to its size in 2002.
""This is catastrophic, literally on a scale never seen before in history,"" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said. ""The real issue is what happens next.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the figures were no surprise as Britain's huge services sector was being hit particularly hard by social distancing measures, but he said a recovery would follow.
""Coronavirus is likely to hit a country like the UK economically very hard, we depend on services, on human contact,"" he said. ""But we're also a very resilient and a dynamic economy and we will bounce back.""
Much of Britain's retail sector is due to open its doors next week and the government last month urged people who could not do their jobs at home to return to work as lockdown restrictions are gradually lifted.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey - who has warned of the deepest recession in three centuries this year - said on Wednesday he could see some signs of a recovery but long-term economic damage remained likely.
But the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development says Britain could suffer the worst downturn among the countries it covers, with an 11.5% slump this year.
The BoE is expected to announce a fresh increase of at least 100 billion pounds ($126 billion) in its bond-buying firepower next week.
IFS director Johnson told Sky News the hit might be short, if the roughly one third of private sector employees who are temporarily laid off can return to work, consumers go out and spend again and Britain avoids a second COVID-19 wave.
But he said it was more likely that unemployment would jump when the government's wage subsidy scheme ended in October, and that Britain would limp into 2021 with the risk of a Brexit shock also on the horizon.
Britain left the European Union at the end of January and began a no-change transition period which lasts for the rest of 2020. Talks on a broad new deal have made little progress.
The ONS said output in the dominant services sector fell by 19% in April from March while manufacturing was down more than 24% and construction crashed by 40%.
In the three months to April, the overall economy contracted by 10.4% from the previous three-month period.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 20.0% monthly and 29.5% annual decline.
""We see this as the bottom of this crisis, with industrial production standing 73% below February values. May should see a strong bounce, but the pace of recovery after that is more uncertain,"" said Jacob Nell, economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) bank.
The sectors that suffered most were durable consumer goods, where output plunged 28.9% month-on-month for a 47.7% year-on-year drop and capital goods, with a 26.6% monthly and 40.9% annual decline.
The euro zone's biggest economy, Germany, saw a 30.2% fall in industrial output year-on-year. The second and third biggest, France and Italy, showed production shrinking even more - 34.9% and 42.5% respectively. The fourth biggest economy, Spain, had a 34.3% fall.
The hardest hit was the smallest euro zone economy, Luxembourg, with a 43.9% reduction in output. Ireland was the only country in the 27-nation European Union to show a year-on-year increase in production, of 5.5%.
""As lingering concerns like a new trade war and Brexit continue to be risks to the recovery phase in the months ahead, it could be a long road ahead before industry reaches output seen at the start of 2020,"" said Bert Colijn, economist at ING.

""So plenty of risks surrounding industry at the moment, but the recent easing of lockdowns means that activity in April almost certainly marked the bottom,"" he said.

The figure marked a rise of 8.5 billion euros from the 167.5 billion euros borrowed in April.
In August 2012, Spanish banks had taken an all-time high of 411 billion euros from the ECB, when the country's financial turmoil reached a peak and weak lenders were granted a 41.3 billion-euro aid package from the European Union that summer.
Banks in the euro zone are expected to apply for cheap new long-term funding lines later this month to help mitigate the impact from the coronavirus outbreak.
With the euro zone's economy deep in recession and banks bracing for a new wave of non-payments from clients, the European Central Bank said in April it would make loans to banks even cheaper.
In its latest move to support the sector, the ECB said it would now pay banks at least 0.50% and up to 1% if they tap its three-year loan auctions.
Under the new ECB schemes, they will earn 0.50% for one year from June by simply tapping the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) auction and 1% if they pass on the cash to households or companies.
That may prove enticing particularly for lenders in peripheral countries such as Spain, which can use the cash to buy higher-yielding domestic government bonds and pocket the difference in interest rates.

The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis in April, the smallest advance since December 2010. May's core PCE price index data will be released at the end of the month.
In May, wholesale food prices increased 6.0%, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the 1.6% jump in goods prices, the largest increase since the series was revamped in November 2009. Food prices, which fell 0.5% in April, were boosted last month by a 40.4% surge in meat prices. Goods prices fell 3.3% in April.
Wholesale energy prices rebounded 4.5% after collapsing 19.0% in April. Gasoline prices shot up 43.9% after diving 56.6% in April, the largest decrease since the series began in February 1947. Core goods prices were unchanged last month after falling 0.4% in April.
The cost of services fell 0.2% in May after a similar decline in the prior month. Services were held down by a 0.8% drop in margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers. Prices for transportation and warehousing services advanced 1.5%.
The cost of healthcare services increased 0.5% after being unchanged In April. Portfolio management fees rebounded 3.9% last month after plummeting 12.0% in April. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index.

Of businesses which took part in a survey by the Office for National Statistics in the second half of May and early June, 5% had started trading again within the prior two weeks and another 5% intended to restart trading within two weeks.
Nearly 80% had been trading for more than two weeks while 12% planned to remain closed.
About one in five businesses in Britain temporarily closed because of the lockdown, the ONS has previously found.
Britain's government last month encouraged workers in manufacturing and construction to go back to their jobs and non-essential shops can reopen from next week.
The ONS said separately on Thursday that more than one-fifth of usual household spending had not been possible during the lockdown because of restrictions on activities such travel and eating out.
It also estimated that 39% of household spending on essentials could be subject to a payment holiday, equivalent to 173 pounds per week, potentially helping to soften some of the severe contraction in the economy caused by the lockdown.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits totaled 1.54 million in the week ending June 6, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday, while the number of continuing claims remained above 20 million, reinforcing the view that the labor market could take years to recover from the pandemic even as businesses re-open.
The initial claims number was slightly better than forecasts for 1.55 million and was down from 1.89 million in the prior week. Claims have been gradually decreasing since hitting a record 6.86 million in the week ended March 28.
Continuing claims, which show the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, came in above expectations at 20.92 million in the week ended May 30, down slightly from 21.26 million a week earlier.
Continuing claims figures are reported with a one-week delay but are considered offering a better view of the labor market. Continuing claims have eased from a record high of 24.91 million in early May.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's auto sales in May rose 14.5% from the same month a year earlier, industry data showed on Thursday, the second consecutive month of increase as the world's biggest vehicle market recovers from lows hit during coronavirus lockdowns.
The result followed a 4.4% rise in April and a 43% drop in March, when the pandemic pummelled demand. Before April, sales had suffered an almost two-year slump.

Sales in May rose to 2.19 million vehicles, showed data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), the country's largest auto industry association.
Government support policies and improving consumer confidence contributed the May growth, said senior CAAM official Chen Shihua during an online briefing.
However, developments with the global pandemic might impact overseas demand for China-made vehicles, Chen said.
In May, sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs) fell for an 11th month to 82,000 units, the data showed. NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
Automakers including Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175), Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and the United States'  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported positive China sales in May.
CAAM last month said annual auto sales could fall 15% to 25% due to, for instance, government restrictions on movement and business aimed at containing the novel coronavirus.
The outlook indicates challenges ahead as the industry works to emerge from the prolonged slump in demand, which was also exacerbated by a trade war with the United States.

Xu Haidong, another CAAM official, said the industry body now thinks China's full-year auto sales will be better than expectations for a 15% fall. He did not elaborate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Layoffs in the United States are abating, but millions who lost their jobs because of COVID-19 continue to draw unemployment benefits, suggesting the labor market could take years to heal from the pandemic even as businesses resume hiring workers.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, will follow news last Friday of a surprise 2.5 million increase in nonfarm payrolls in May. It could reinforce views that the labor market has weathered the worst of the turbulence.
The Federal Reserve signaled on Wednesday it would provide years of extraordinary support for the economy, with policymakers projecting a 9.3% unemployment rate at year end. The unemployment rate has jumped from 3.5% in February and was at 13.3% in May.
""The steady retreat in claims is a positive development, but the labor market has suffered a traumatic blow and a full recovery will be measured in years, not weeks or months,"" said 
Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The figures don't capture the full extent of the blow dealt to workers during this unique crisis."" 
New applications for state unemployment benefits likely totaled a seasonally adjusted 1.55 million for the week ended June 6, down from 1.877 million the prior week, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would pull initial claims further away from a record 6.867 million in late March. 
But claims for jobless benefits would still be more than double their peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
Many businesses have reopened after being shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19. However, claims remain elevated amid jobs cuts outside the consumer sector, among industries that were not initially hit by the shutdown.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday there would an ""extended period"" during which it would be ""difficult for many people to find work.""
DISTORTED PICTURE
Initial claims are recorded when a person submits a first application for unemployment benefits. Once approved they become continuing claims and are reported with a one-week lag. 
The report on Thursday is expected to show continuing claims slipped to 20 million in the week ending May 30 from 21.487 million in the prior week. Continuing claims have eased from a record high of 24.912 million in early May. 
That decline has been attributed to the government's Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, that offers businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee salaries.
""We are seeing the labor market high on PPP money,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""Once it runs out we might see a significant increase in layoffs again."" 
Economists caution that neither initial nor continuing claims give an accurate picture. 
The government has expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits to include gig workers, the self-employed and independent contractors who have been affected by the pandemic. These workers do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance and must file claims under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. 
Though PUA are filed weekly, they are not included in the initial and continuing claims count. Roughly 36 states are processing PUA claims. Economists recommend focusing on benefit recipients for all programs, which totaled 30 million in the week ending May 16.

""The labor market will continue to be under duress as businesses adapt to an economy running well below capacity, resulting in elevated layoffs,"" said Alex Lin, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) Global Research in New York.

514,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 07:27PM ET</span>",U.S. Jobs Focus Shifts Back to Losses After May’s Surprise Gain,"(Bloomberg) -- After the U.S. labor market posted a surprise improvement in May, the weekly jobless-claims data will remind people that economic pain remains widespread -- even if it’s gradually abating.
About 1.55 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the median estimate of economists. While that would mark the 10th straight decline from the record 6.87 million in late March, it’s still more than seven times the pre-pandemic average.
The total number claiming benefits through the regular state programs, which is reported with a one-week lag, are projected to have declined to 20 million in the week ended May 30. That’s still more than 11 times the level prior to the pandemic.
While the weekly report is beset by quirks and data-gathering issues, it helps shed light on the still-elevated ranks of the unemployed. That provides a counterpoint to the market exuberance following the government’s May jobs report, which also had its own data-collection errors that skewed the figures to look more positive.
The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday it expects to hold interest rates near zero for at least 2 1/2 years to help employment fully recover. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that “despite the improvement seen in the May jobs report, unemployment remains historically high,” with the pace of recovery highly uncertain and dependent on containing the virus.
In addition to the depressed state of employment, there are several risks that could hold back a rebound or cause a fresh decline. They include a second wave of the coronavirus causing another round of shutdowns and the chance that businesses will lay off workers who were rehired or retained to comply with loans under the government’s Paycheck Protection Program.
“We have to have a little bit of caution” after the May jobs report, said Beata Caranci, chief economist at TD Bank. “Those businesses that reopened -- even at reduced capacity -- are naturally going to have demand for workers. The question is: do you get back to where you were before? And I think that’s pretty far-fetched.”
“There’s a significant amount of people still displaced,” she added.
Record Contraction
Despite the May jobs gain, most economists still expect a record decline in gross domestic product in the second quarter, with Bloomberg’s survey showing an annualized contraction of 34.4%.
The broader issue is economic activity remaining weak as the unprecedented downturn shuttered businesses and reduced demand permanently in some areas.
By the end of the year, 8 million to 12 million Americans will remain laid-off, particularly in the hospitality and restaurant industries, according to Daniel Alpert, a founding managing partner at Westwood Capital and co-creator of the Job Quality Index, which measures the ratio of high-quality jobs -- those with higher wages and longer hours -- to low-quality jobs.
Alpert bases the estimate on a step-down in business creation and increase in business shutdowns, or “deaths.” He said a large portion of the gain in May jobs consisted of workers rehired by businesses using the PPP.
That coincided with a sharp drop in continuing jobless claims for the week ended May 16, also the reference period for the May jobs report that captured a jump in employment.
Benefit Transfer
“All it was from a macro standpoint was a transfer of one government benefit for another,” Alpert said by phone. “It’s absolutely not a picture of business and labor markets” coming back and “more importantly it’s not a picture of aggregate demand” returning, he said.
If the PPP program isn’t expanded, employment could eventually weaken again if companies may resume layoffs. The deadline for PPP applications is June 30, so companies facing issues after that can’t apply. Businesses who have already applied have until the end of the year to convert their loan to a grant if they rehire employees.
The monthly labor report and weekly claims figures can appear to tell two different stories. Both are important to understanding the reality on the ground, according to Erica Groshen, former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes the monthly jobs report.
“In the beginning, we saw just entirely job destruction -- at least temporarily -- and now we’re in a period of time where we have high volumes of both: job creation and job destruction,” she said by phone.

The Institute of Directors said its monthly sentiment survey showed business leaders' confidence in the economy rose to -60 in May from -67 in April, which was the lowest reading since the survey began in July 2016.
But both investment and hiring intentions sank to their lowest in the survey's history.
""It's too early to say we've turned the corner,"" IoD chief economist Tej Parikh said. ""Revenue isn't expected to pick up, ​which means investment and hiring plans are very much on hold.""
The IoD figures are broadly in line with other business surveys which have shown a small pick-up in activity since April, when coronavirus restrictions were heaviest.
Official due data on Friday is likely to show economic output in April was more than a fifth lower than the year before, according to a Reuters poll of economist.
Restrictions on businesses in England are steadily being lifted, though for some sectors such as hospitality there is no clear timetable for when operations can return to normal.

The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said its headline house price balance slumped to -32% in May, its lowest since 2010, from -22% in April.
But expectations for house prices in 12 months' time were less negative than a month earlier and new buyer enquiries recovered from a record low of -94% in April to -5% in May.
Near-term sales expectations were now broadly neutral and the 12-month outlook improved, RICS said.
Property website Zoopla said on Wednesday that house sales in England had rebounded since the government allowed estate agents to reopen last month.
RICS Chief Economist Simon Rubinsohn said sales that were in the pipeline before the lockdown were now largely going through. 
""But it remains to be seen how sustained this improvement will prove,"" he said, pointing to uncertainty about a possible jump in unemployment when the government's jobs retention programme expires at the end of October.
""For the time being respondents to the survey see the trend in transactions being broadly flat.""

The survey also showed buyers, after their lockdown experience, were looking increasingly for properties with gardens or balconies and located nearer to green spaces.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 03:05PM ET</span>",U.S. inflation subdued with economy in recession,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices fell for a third straight month in May and underlying inflation was weak as demand for goods and services remained subdued amid a recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But with nonessential businesses reopening after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19, deflation, a decline in the general price level, is unlikely. Still, the report from the Labor Department on Wednesday suggested the disinflationary trend could persist for a while. 
That together with a struggling labor market supports the Federal Reserve's commitment to maintain its very accommodative monetary policy stance for some time while nursing the economy back to health. The U.S. central bank said on Wednesday COVID-19 ""will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term."" 
""We expect the crisis to result in a sustained slowing in inflation due to a net increase in slack,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities in New York. 
The Labor Department said its consumer price index dipped 0.1% last month after plunging 0.8% in April, which was the largest decline since December 2008. Prices were held down by a 3.5% drop in the cost of gasoline, which followed a 20.6% plunge in April. That offset a 0.7% increase in the cost of food last month. Food prices jumped 1.5% in April. 
Prices for food consumed at home rose 1.0% after surging 2.6% in April. The cost of beef shot up a record 10.8% in May, reflecting shortages as a result of COVID-19 infections at meat processing plants. Expensive food has led consumers to anticipate higher inflation this year.
Consumers also paid more for dairy products, fruits and vegetables. But cereals and bakery products were cheaper last month. In the 12 months through May, the CPI edged up 0.1%. That was the smallest year-on-year rise since September 2015 and followed a 0.3% increase in April. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would be unchanged in May and gain 0.2% year-on-year.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared on Monday that the economy slipped into recession in February. 
The Labor Department said in-store data collection had remained suspended since March 16 because of risks of exposure to COVID-19. The department added that data collection last month was also impacted ""by the temporary closing or limited operations of certain types of establishments,"" leading to ""an increase in the number of prices being considered temporarily unavailable and imputed.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed in choppy trading. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RENTS INCREASE 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI slipped 0.1% in May after decreasing 0.4% in April, the largest drop since the series started in 1957. The so-called core CPI fell in March for the first time since January 2010.
May marked the first time that the core CPI has dropped for three consecutive months. Underlying inflation was depressed by continued decreases in the costs of motor vehicle insurance and apparel. Airline fares fell 4.9% and used cars and trucks prices dropped 0.4%. 
The cost of hotel and motel accommodation dropped 1.8% last month after record 8.1% plunge in April. 
Those price declines offset a 0.3% increase in owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home. This rent measure gained 0.2% in April, likely reflecting forbearance agreements between landlords and tenants who have lost their jobs or have had their hours cut because of the global pandemic.
The economy has shed nearly 20 million jobs since March. 
Healthcare costs increased 0.5% in May after a solid 0.4% rise in April. Consumers paid more for household furnishings, new vehicles, alcoholic beverages and education. 
In the 12 months through May, the core CPI rose 1.2%, the smallest gain since March 2011. The core CPI increased 1.4% year-on-year in April.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis in April, the smallest advance since December 2010. May's core PCE price index data will be released at the end of the month.
The Fed projected core inflation rising 1.0% this year and picking up to 1.5% in 2021. Back in December, it forecast inflation at 1.9% this year and 2% in 2021. 

""The weakness in the economy should keep downward pressure on inflation over time and we expect softness in the core measures to be reported for upcoming months,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But we think that we probably have moved past the largest sequential monthly declines in inflation that came shortly after the virus spread.""

Investing.com – The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday, and reiterated its commitment to maintaining easy monetary policy measures for some time.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25%. 
The low-rate environment will continue for some time, with policymakers backing rates to remain unchanged through 2022.  The Fed's interest-rate outlook for 2020, 2021 and 2022 was lowered to 0.1% from previous projections in December of 1.6%, 1.9% and 2.1% respectively, the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections showed.
""The committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said.
The decision comes as the central bank continues to roll out its lending programs to support the economy, which officially entered a recession in February, data earlier this week showed.
A surprise upturn in U.S. hiring in May, as reported last week, stoked some investor hopes that the economy is shaping up for a speedier recovery, but the Fed slashed its growth forecasts for the years ahead amid uncertainty over the impact from the pandemic. 
The economy is expected to contract by 6.5% in 2020, down from an estimate for 2% growth previously, but return to growth, albeit well below previous estimates, in 2021 and 2022. The Fed expects the economy to grow by 5% next year, and 3.5% in 2022, up from previous estimates of 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively.
The unemployment rate for the year is expected to come in at 9.3%, up from 3.5% previously, but eventually, fall to 5.5% by 2022.
The pace of inflation, which will continue to be the key driver for future monetary policy, is forecast to cool to a rate of 0.8%, down from 1.9% previously. While core-PCE inflation for 2021 was revised lower to 1.5% from 2%.
The wave of stimulus from the Fed has taken its balance sheet above $7 trillion from about $4 trillion just before the pandemic struck in the U.S. in early March. But the central bank has no plans to rein in quantitative easing, pledging to maintain the current pace of bond purchases over the coming months to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Purchases over the coming months will be made across a range of debt including Treasuries, agency residential, and commercial mortgage-backed securities."

The May deficit brought the year-to-date fiscal deficit to $1.88 trillion, already eclipsing the previous full-year record of $1.4 trillion in 2009, with some analysts predicting a gap as high as $3.8 trillion for the fiscal year to Sept. 30.
May receipts fell 25% to $174 billion, powered largely by a 16% drop in individual withheld taxes and a 62% drop in corporate income tax payments. Outlays were up 30% to $573 billion.
A U.S. Treasury official told Reuters that it was difficult to predict when the coronavirus relief outlays would peak in the federal budget data. 

While the May deficit reflected large spending on direct payments to individuals, it did not reflect the outlays for forgivable small business loans. Those numbers will show up in the budget as loans are forgiven between the end of June and late October, the official said.

The Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) business confidence index (BCI), compiled by the Bureau for Economic Research, was at 5 points for the second quarter, the lowest level since the first survey in 1975 and down from 18 points for the first quarter.
Africa's most industrialised economy, which entered its second recession in two years in 2019, has been largely shut down since late March, when the government imposed severe restrictions to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The country began phased easing of the lockdown in May.
""COVID-19 has drastically changed the already-weak economic landscape and perhaps, in some cases, permanently,"" RMB chief economist Ettienne le Roux said.
""We are likely only beginning to fully appreciate the complexity of the economic impacts of this pandemic.""
Firms will likely continue to face an income squeeze as costs rise, while weak demand weighs on prices, and many will have to find new ways of doing business, according to the survey.
It also said that the BCI plunge to five was consistent with a ""never seen before"" contraction in economic growth.
South Africa's central bank expects the economy to shrink 7% this year, but economists expect an even deeper recession as well as deep job losses.
The survey showed that business confidence declined across all sectors, but retail confidence held up relative to the other sectors because of the sale of essential goods.

The Producer Price Index fell 3.7% in May year-on-year, with analyst forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a 3.3% drop. The PPI fell by 3.1% in April.
Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index fell 2.4% year-on-year, while falling 0.8% month-on-month, during the same month.

Some investors suggested that the disappointing data showed that demand continued to be weak and that domestic recovery was not as far along as hoped for.

The drop in producer prices was led by a 57.6% slide in prices in the oil and natural gas industry and a 24.4% drop in the oil, coal and other fuels processing sector, the statistics bureau said.
On a monthly basis, however, producer prices showed some signs of steadying. May producer prices fell 0.4% from the previous month, easing from April's 1.3% fall, the bureau said.
Exports contracted in May as global coronavirus lockdowns continued to devastate demand while a deeper fall in imports pointed to mounting pressure on the key manufacturing sector.
Official and private factory surveys also indicated deep contractions in export orders. 
Beijing has in recent months rolled out fiscal and monetary stimulus to prop up the economy, which contracted for the first time on record in the January-March period.
China's decision not to set a growth target for 2020 signalled Beijing's continued wariness about overly aggressive stimulus. But weak economic readings could pressure policymakers to roll out additional support measures to meet job creation and unemployment rate targets for the year. 
MORE POLICY SUPPORT NEEDED
Analysts see easing consumer inflation giving Beijing more policy space to reduce the economic toll from the pandemic.
""We believe falling CPI inflation and continued PPI deflation will provide Beijing with more space to implement policy stimulus to offset the impact of COVID-19 on the economy,"" Nomura analysts said in a research note.
Pan Gongsheng, vice governor of the People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY), said last week that the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic was bigger than first expected and that more monetary and credit policy support was needed. 
The consumer price index rose 2.4% from a year earlier - the weakest reading since March 2019 - compared with a 3.3% increase in April, as food prices continued to ease. Analysts had projected a 2.7% rise.
That was largely due to slowing food prices, which rose 10.6% in May from a year earlier, versus a 14.8% rise in April. Food price increases in May were led by an 81.7% rise in pork prices, compared with a 96.9% jump previously, the data showed.
Non-food prices in May rose 0.4%.
Core inflation - which excludes food and energy costs - remained benign last month at 1.1%，unchanged from April's rise. 
Martin Rasmussen, China economist at Capital Economics, said an acceleration in infrastructure construction looks set to drive a rebound in producer prices.

China's economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction since quarterly records began.

The sentiment index advanced 6.3% to 93.7 in June, having recovered all of the extreme 20% drop recorded during the March-April pandemic peak,  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp. said in a statement Wednesday. The “economy, next 12mths” sub-index gained another 8.4% and the “economy, next 5yrs’ sub-index was up 6.4%.”
“The index is now only 2% below the average in the preceding September to February period,” said Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac. Still, he noted, “with the unemployment rate set to remain elevated; extensive restrictions staying in place and the economy facing permanent structural change it would be surprising if the recent upward momentum continues.”
Australia has begun loosening restrictions imposed in March as the government executes a three-stage plan to reopen the economy by the end of July. The nation’s eight state and territory governments are moving at their own pace, depending on the number of Covid-19 infections in their jurisdictions.
Meanwhile, the stimulus payments have landed in Australian’s bank accounts, suggesting they’re ready to accelerate the recovery. Evans noted similar signs.
“The picture from buyer sentiment suggests we may see a significant ‘pop higher’ in some forms of spending near term,” he said, noting the “time to buy a major item” sub-index posted another strong 10.1% gain in June after a 26.7% surge in May.
The survey was based on responses from 1,200 people and conducted in the week from June 1-5.

The unemployment rate climbed to 4.5% last month, from 3.8% in April, data from the statistics office showed Wednesday. Economists expected a rise to 4%. The number of jobs fell by 392,000 in May from the prior year.
South Korea’s businesses are slashing hiring to cut costs as exports continue to fall and consumption remains sluggish. The rise in the unemployment rate comes despite the government relaxing social distancing restrictions in April, allowing freer public gatherings that unleashed some pent-up demand for services.
Wednesday’s report showed the manufacturing sector lost 57,000 jobs in May, with another 371,000 positions shed by firms in retail, wholesale, restaurant and hotel businesses. The economy added 54,000 jobs in agriculture.
A separate report this week from the labor ministry showed payouts for jobless claims topped 1 trillion won ($835 million) last month, the highest on record.
South Korea Unveils $62 Bln Post-Virus Plan to Reshape Economy
The weakness in the labor market adds urgency to President Moon Jae-in’s push to create jobs in technology sectors less vulnerable to a pandemic. The latest extra budget, part of which is earmarked to fund Moon’s “New Deal” project for jobs, is awaiting parliament’s approval.
South Korea’s government has so far pledged more than 270 trillion won in spending to cushion the impact of the virus, while the Bank of Korea has slashed its key rate to a record low of 0.5%. Still, the government expects the economy to barely grow this year, with no increase in employment.

Across Britain as a whole, newly agreed sales in the first week of June were 12% below where they were in the first week of March, reflecting the ongoing closure of the property market in Scotland and Wales due to coronavirus restrictions.
In central and northern England, sales have returned to pre-coronavirus levels, Zoopla said. 
Sales in London have lagged behind as some buyers look at moving outside the British capital, where a reliance on public transport has made it harder for life to return to normal.
Bank of England data showed mortgage approvals for house purchases slumped in April to their lowest since records began in 1997, at just a fifth of their level in February, as prospective buyers were unable to visit properties for sale. 
Mortgage lender Nationwide reported a 1.7% monthly fall in prices in May, the biggest drop since the financial crisis in 2009.
Zoopla said pricing in June was stronger, with asking prices 6% higher than a year earlier. But it warned weakness was likely later in the year.

""We still believe that this spike in demand will be short-lived as the economic impacts of COVID start to feed through into market sentiment and levels of market activity in 2020 H2,"" said Zoopla's research director, Richard Donnell.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",U.S. layoffs ease in April; hiring slumps to record low,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Layoffs in the United States fell in April, but remained the second highest on record, while hiring hit an all-time low, suggesting the labor market could take years to recover from the COVID-19 crisis despite a surprise rebound in employment in May.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed a decline in job openings as the economy battles a recession triggered by the pandemic. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared on Monday that the economy slipped into recession in February. 
""We may continue to see elevated rates of layoffs and job cuts continue to spread to other sectors, but the tidal wave of layoffs appears to be behind us,"" said Nick Bunker, research director at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""The labor market has a lot more progress to make."" 
The monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed layoffs and discharges dropped 3.8 million in April to 7.7 million. That was second highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2000. 
Prior to the pandemic, layoffs hovered around 1.8 million. They are nearly three times the worst month of the Great Recession. The layoffs and discharge rate fell to 5.9% in April from a record high 7.6% in March.
The labor market was slammed by the closure of nonessential businesses in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19. Many establishments reopened in May, with the economy adding a stunning 2.509 million jobs last month after a record 20.7 million plunge in April, government data showed on Friday.
Economists warn it could take even a decade for the labor market to recoup the jobs lost during the COVID-19 recession. The NBER does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP as is the rule of thumb in many countries, instead it looks for a drop in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed a modest increase in wholesale inventories in April that was likely to be eclipsed by a plunge in stocks at retailers, suggesting inventory investment could again be a drag on economic output in the second quarter. 
Economists expect gross domestic product could decline at as much as a 40% annualized rate in the second quarter, which would the largest drop in GDP since the Great Depression.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed after strong gains in the previous sessions, with investors awaiting the Federal Reserve's assessment of the economy at the end of the U.S. central bank's two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
HUMAN SUFFERING
The Labor Department report showed big decreases in layoffs in the accommodation and food services and retail trade. Layoffs, however, increased in the construction, information and wholesale trade industries. 
Hiring tumbled 1.6 million to a record low 3.5 million in April. The hiring rate plunged to an all-time low of 2.7% from 3.4% in March. Hiring decreased in many industries, with the biggest declines in professional and business services, accommodation and food services and construction.
Hiring was around 5.9 million each month before COVID-19.
""The human suffering and lost productive potential represented by these numbers is immeasurable,"" said Heidi Shierholz, a former chief economist at the Labor Department and now head of policy at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, declined 965,000 to 5.0 million on the last business day of April, the lowest since December 2014. The decline in job openings was concentrated in the professional and business services, healthcare and social assistance and retail trade industries. Government vacancies dropped by 82,000 jobs.
The job openings rate dropped to 3.7%, the lowest since January 2017, from 3.8% in March. Vacancies peaked at 7.52 million in January 2019. There were 4.6 unemployed workers for every job opening in April.
""Many of these jobs may have been posted a few months back and this isn't necessarily an opportunity for those who lost their employment in the pandemic recession,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 

The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs dropped one million to 1.8 million, the lowest since January 2010. The quits rates, which is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, fell to a nine-year low of 1.4% from 1.8% in March.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Turkey's April current account $4.5 billion in deficit: Reuters poll,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's current account is expected to record a deficit of $4.5 billion in April, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, remaining high as measures against the coronavirus hamper exports and tourism revenues.
Turkey's long history of current account deficits, which reached $52.4 billion on a 12-month basis in 2018, are again concerning investors as the lira weakens and the central bank's foreign exchange reserves diminish.
While Turkey's current account is now on a far stronger footing, large deficits leave economies reliant on speculative inflows of funds and potentially on reserves to finance the shortfall.
Forecasts ranged between deficits of $4 billion and $5 billion for April's current account balance, according to the Reuters poll of nine economists. The median was $4.5 billion.
The largest part of the deficit comes from the foreign trade component, which saw a downturn in exports in April, as well as drastically lower income from tourism, said Daglar Ozkan, economist at Is Yatirim.
""We expect the biggest impact on the current account balance in April from a large fall in the services component since the travel income is near zero,"" he said, adding that exports likely hit their lowest point in April.
The 12-month current account ended last year in surplus for the first time since 2001, though the monthly reading has dipped back into deficit as the economy strongly recovered from a recession brought on by a 2018 currency crisis.
The economy grew 0.9% last year and it is expected to slump again due to measures taken to curb the COVID-19 outbreak. The lira has fallen about 16% so far this year as worries have grown over potential balance-of-payments problems.
For all of 2020, the median estimate of six economists was for a current account deficit of $7.80 billion, up slightly from last month's poll. Poll forecasts ranged between deficits of $3.5 billion and $15 billion.
Turkey's foreign trade deficit, a main component of the current account, leapt 67% year-on-year in April to $4.56 billion according to the general trade system, data from the statistics institute shows.
Ozkan said he expects some recovery in exports starting in June, while imports remain at current levels, although tourism income will remain drastically low, at around half of the net income in 2019.
In March, the central bank revised current account data going back to 2013 as part of a new calculation method that trimmed historical deficits and boosted the 2019 surplus. The revisions totalled some $44 billion between 2013 and 2019.

The Turkish central bank is expected to announce April current account data at 0700 GMT on June 12.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that wholesale inventories rose 0.3% in April instead of increasing 0.4% as reported last month. Stocks at wholesalers dropped 1.1% in March. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product increased 0.6% in April.
The government estimated last month that retail inventories plunged 3.6% in April. That estimate will be updated next Tuesday. A drawdown of inventories contributed to GDP shrinking at a 5.0% annualized rate in the first quarter, the sharpest pace of contraction since the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of U.S. recessions, declared on Monday that the economy slipped into recession in February. Nonessential businesses were shuttered in much of the country in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, almost bringing the economy to a halt.
The NBER does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in economic activity spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
Inventory investment has subtracted from GDP for four straight quarters. The drag in recent quarters reflects declining imports, which have been depressed by the White House's trade war with China and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Goods imports tumbled to more than a nine-year low in April.
Sales at wholesalers dropped a record 16.9% in April after falling 5.1% in March. At April's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.65 months to clear shelves, up from 1.36 months in March.

The number of available positions dropped to 5.05 million from a revised 6.01 million in March, according to the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released Tuesday. That compares with a median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists for 5.75 million openings.
Separations, which include layoffs and quits, cooled to 9.89 million in April from a record 14.64 million in March, when shutdowns related to the coronavirus prompted employers to sharply reduce staffing levels. While the survey illustrates how quickly employers went from hiring to workforce reduction, last week’s jobs report showed a record 2.5 million surge in payrolls and indicated the labor market is getting back on track as business lockdowns are lifted.
The JOLTS data lags behind the monthly employment report by a month, but it offers a level of detail not available in the jobs report. The Labor Department said it modified the April JOLTS estimates to better reflect the virus impact and the figures aren’t directly comparable with the survey period used for the establishment survey in the monthly jobs report.
Only 1.79 million people quit their jobs in April, down from 2.79 million a month earlier. The quits rate, which measures voluntary job leavers as a share of total employment, dropped to 1.4% -- the lowest since April 2011. At the start of the year, when the jobs market was at its best in decades, the quits rate was near the highest level in history.
As employers cut millions of workers from their payrolls across the country, there were 4.6 unemployed workers competing for every job opening in April. That stands in stark contrast to a two-year trend in which vacancies exceeded the number of unemployed.
The JOLTS report showed hires dropped to 3.52 million in April from 5.11 million a month earlier, while the hires rate declined to a record-low 2.7%.

Turkey identified its first case of the coronavirus in the country on March 11, and soon after imposed strict measures to slow the spread. Many factories temporarily halted operations.
Industrial production contracted 2% in March, compared to expectations of 1.8% expansion in a Reuters poll.
The median estimate in a Reuters poll of seven institutions showed a year-on-year contraction of 17% of the calendar-adjusted industrial production index in April.
Forecasts ranged between contractions of 9.5% and 28%.
Turkey's economy expanded by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2020, remaining below expectations. It had contracted annually in the three quarters to the middle of 2019, with growth surging in the final quarter of the year.
Industrial production, viewed as a pre-cursor to growth figures, had expanded for six consecutive months before March after contracting annually for 12 straight months.
The government had forecast 5% growth in 2020 before the coronavirus outbreak. Officials say Turkey could still end the year with positive growth, with the second quarter expected to be hit the most by the pandemic.
Analysts expect the impact of the coronavirus outbreak to tip the economy into its second recession in as many years.

Unemployment peaked at a record 15.4% in early April following mass furloughs and layoffs as the coronavirus outbreak triggered shutdowns of parts of the economy.
Counting only the fully unemployed, the rate stood at 5.7% on Tuesday, up from 2.3% since February.
""The number of (fully) unemployed continues to fall, and we see a drop in all job categories and across the whole country. The decline is mainly due to fewer furloughs,"" NAV chief Sigrun Vaageng said in a statement.

Eurostat said GDP of the 19 countries sharing the euro contracted 3.6% quarter-on-quarter for a 3.1% year-on-year fall. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading in line with Eurostat's own initial estimates in mid-May of a 3.8% quarterly and a 3.2% annual contraction.
The statistics office said that of the total fall in the GDP, household consumption was responsible for 2.5 percentage points and investment for 1 points of GDP. 
The contribution from trade was also negative at a net -0.4 points. Lower government spending, before states ramped up their response to the pandemic, also took away 0.1 points while growing inventories added 0.3 points.
Eurostat said the trade transport and hospitality sector as well as arts and entertainment were hit the most with a 6.8% drop quarter-on-quarter as most euro zone countries locked down their economies during March to slow down the spread of the virus.
Euro zone agriculture, forestry and fishing as well as financial and insurance activities suffered least in the first quarter, both sectors contracting by only 0.8% against the previous three months.

Many economists believe the pandemic will push the German economy into its biggest decline since the end of World War Two in the second quarter.
Seasonally adjusted exports dived 24% on the month while imports slid by 16.5%. The trade surplus shrank to 3.2 billion euros, the Federal Statistics Office said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall by 15.6% and saw imports down 16%. The trade surplus was expected to come in at 10.0 billion euros.
Alexander Krueger, economist at Bankhaus Lampe, said a recovery may have already started due to a loosening of the lockdown and re-opening of borders, but little was left of the last decade's export boom.
""The road out of the corona trough is long, rocky and above all uncertain, especially for foreign trade,"" he said. 
Despite a 130 billion euro stimulus package announced last week, which comes on top of 750 billion euros worth of measures announced in March, the government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year.
Economists expect a slow recovery and the pace will depend largely on how fast Germany's European neighbours and other trade partners including China and the United States emerge from the crisis.

Exports to France and the United States, hit hard by the coronavirus, fell most while those to China, which was first affected by the virus but which has since started to see some signs of recovery, fell slightly less sharply, the Office said.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy is on course to contract 10.3% this year, before it bounces back with growth of 6.9% in 2021 and 3.9% in 2022, the Bank of France forecast.
Nearly a million jobs are likely to be shed this year and unemployment could climb to a new record of 11.8% in the first half of 2021.
The central bank said the outlook could be brighter if the virus is quickly brought under control, while a second wave of infections could plunge the economy into a 16% downturn this year followed by growth of only 6% in 2021 and 4% in 2022.
The forecasts did not take into account the potential impact of a recovery plan that the government aims to announce in the coming months.
President Emmanuel Macron put France under one of the most stringent lockdowns in Europe in mid-March, effectively shutting down large swathes of the economy until restrictions began to be lifted on May 11.
As of the end of May, economic activity was still running 17% below normal levels, though up from the 32% reduction seen during the first two weeks of lockdown in March, the central bank estimated. Business surveys suggested activity could get back to less than 12% of normal levels this month, it added.

Nonetheless, the time spent under lockdown meant that the economy probably contracted 15% in the second quarter from the previous three months, when it had already slumped 5.3%, the Bank of France estimated.

The number of deals fell 43% to 42 for the year ended Dec. 31, while investments fell 62% to $2.4 billion.
""Chinese (overseas direct investment) into Australia has fallen at a faster rate in 2019 than Chinese investment into other western countries, including the U.S.,"" said report author Hans Hendrischke, professor of Chinese business and management at the University of Sydney.
Privately-owned Chinese firms accounted for 84% of Chinese investment in Australia by value and 76% of the deals.
Australia announced substantial changes to foreign investment rules on Friday that would extend the existing scrutiny of state-owned investors to private investors, and impose a national security test for purchases in sensitive areas.
The tightening of foreign investment screening globally had been accompanied by a worsening perception of China and the ""purpose"" of investments, the report said, adding, this ""could become more negative as a result of the coronavirus pandemic"".
""Locally, Chinese investors have taken this to be another signal that Australia is less welcoming of their investment"" it said.
Food and agriculture (44%) was the largest area of Chinese investment, led by the A$1.5 billion ($1.05 billion) acquisition of Bellamy's Australia by Mengniu Dairy Company.
Commercial real estate made up 43% of Chinese FDI, while deals in the mining sector fell by half.
Chinese state-owned enterprises had moved investment away from developed markets and towards the countries aligned with China's Belt and Road Initiative, and Latin America, the report noted.

The British Retail Consortium said total retail spending at its members - mostly large chains - was 5.9% lower than a year earlier, compared with a record 19.1% drop in April, when almost all non-essential stores were closed.
Last month's fall was still the second-biggest drop since the survey started in 1995, and the BRC said sales in May 2019 had been weaker than normal too.
Nonetheless, the figures fit with other survey data that has shown some business recovery since April when coronavirus lockdown restrictions had their greatest effect.
Official data showed a record 18% annual fall in retail spending, excluding fuel, in April.
Online spending for non-food items was up by a record 60% on a year earlier - though the BRC warned this did not necessarily mean customers would flock back to the high street when non-essential stores are allowed to reopen on June 15.
""Weak consumer confidence and social distancing rules are likely to hold back sales,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Payments company Barclaycard said its broader measure of consumer spending, based on transactions on around half of Britain's credit and debit cards, showed a 27.7% annual fall compared with a record 36.5% drop in April.
Tuesday's figures showed continued strong sales growth at supermarkets, and a rebound in spending at garden centres and home improvement stores, which reopened last month and saw sales down just 3% on a year ago, according to Barclaycard.

Restaurants and cafes, which reported a 79% fall in revenue in April, said sales in May were down 70% on a year earlier, as some began to offer more takeaway and delivery services.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",U.S. consumers grew slightly more optimistic about jobs and earnings in May,"By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - U.S. consumers felt slightly more optimistic about their finances and job security in May as businesses began to reopen and rehire workers following the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve.
While the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic were still broadly evident, the findings support recent employment data suggesting the worst of the job losses caused by the pandemic may have passed.
The share of Americans expecting the U.S. unemployment rate to be higher a year from now dropped to an average 38.9% in May, from 47.6% in April. Perceived chances of losing a job in the next year also dropped to an average 18.7% in May from 20.9% in April, but was still well above the 12-month average of 15.2%.
The U.S. economy added 2.5 million jobs in May and the unemployment rate dropped to 13.3% from 14.7%, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unexpected improvement came after the U.S. labor market shed a record 20.7 million jobs in April, suggesting the job losses may have bottomed out for now as more Americans are called back to work, but that the recovery could be long.
Consumers told the Fed they expected their earnings to grow by a median 2% over the next year, up from 1.8% in April.
Despite feeling slightly more secure in their jobs, consumers said they were worried about being able to afford main household expenses down the line.
Median expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 3% from 2.6% in April, with consumers saying they expect food and gasoline to become much more expensive. Prices for both are expected to increase by 8.7% and 7.8%, respectively, over the next year - the most since the survey was started in 2013.

The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts excluding Quebec fell to 132,576 units from a revised 166,477 units in April, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) said. Economists had expected starts to fall to 155,000.

Including Quebec, starts rose to 193,453 units in May from 166,477 units in April. CMHC left Quebec out of the April survey after construction in the province was disrupted by measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>",German industrial output posts record plunge in April due to coronavirus outbreak,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output posted its steepest plunge on record in April as the coronavirus pandemic forced companies in Europe's largest economy to scale back production, data showed on Monday.
Industrial output dropped by 17.9% on the month, figures released by the Statistics Office showed. A Reuters poll had pointed to a drop of 16.0%.
Manufacturers of capital goods recorded the steepest decline of -35.3%. Construction was down 4.1% and output in the energy sector dropped by 7.2%.
As measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus were implemented from mid-March, the restrictions took their toll on a full scale in April, the Economy Ministry said.
""The low point has been reached. With the gradual easing of protective measures and the resumption of production in the automotive industry, the economic recovery is beginning now,"" the ministry added.
The data strengthens expectations that the German economy will post its steepest decline since the end of World War Two in the second quarter.
""German gross domestic product is likely to shrink by more than 10% in the second quarter, a reading never measured before in peacetime"", VP Bank Group economist Thomas Gitzel said.
For 2020 as a whole, the government forecasts GDP will shrink by 6.3%, based on the assumption that a 130 billion euro ($146.69 billion) fiscal stimulus package will help economic activity pick up again in the second half of the year.
The Ifo economic institute said on Monday that manufacturers expect production levels to decline further in the coming three months, but at a slower pace than previously.
Ifo said its index for production expectations rose to -20.4 points in May from -51.0 points in April, marking the biggest monthly rise since German reunification three decades ago.
""But that only means that the nosedive is now becoming flatter,"" said Klaus Wohlrabe, head of the Ifo surveys.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy braced for its worst postwar slump even as first-quarter GDP contracted less than initially thought, as the cornonavirus crisis slams the brakes on global growth and raises pressure on Tokyo to cushion the blow to business and consumers.
Banks are doing their bit to help as lending rose at the fastest annual pace on record in May, a sign companies were tapping loans to meet immediate funding needs to survive slumping sales from the pandemic.
While U.S. and European policymakers have shifted from crisis-response to efforts to prop up growth, Japan is struggling to do so as it continues to focus on preventing a second wave of infection.
In an interview with Reuters, economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said Japan should primarily focus on back-stopping faltering businesses, suggesting the central bank should avoid pushing interest rates deeper into negative territory.
""We're not at a stage yet where we want to stimulate consumption and encourage people to travel a lot. Efforts to stimulate consumption should wait a bit more,"" he said, when asked whether the Bank of Japan should take steps to boost demand, such as deepening negative interest rates.
The world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 2.2% in January-March, revised data showed on Monday, less than the 3.4% contraction indicated in a preliminary reading, as capital expenditure fared better than expected. Analysts had tipped a 2.1% contraction.
But few analysts were hopeful about the outlook for the year since capital spending data used to calculate the revised figures lacked enough responses - most struggling firms appear not to have participated in the survey - and will be updated in July.
On the whole, Monday's revised gross domestic product (GDP) estimate confirmed Japan had slipped into recession - defined as two straight quarters of contraction - for the first time in 4-1/2 years, even before lockdown steps to contain the virus was put in place in April.
""The upward revision to Q1 GDP displayed in the revised estimate is cold comfort given that output is plummeting this quarter,"" said Tom Learmouth, economist at Capital Economics.
'EXTREMELY CHALLENGING' OUTLOOK
Senior economist at Oxford Economics, Stefan Angrick, concurred: ""With the bulk of the impact from the coronavirus pandemic to be felt in Q2, the outlook for 2020 thus remains extremely challenging.""
A series of recent data including exports, factory output and jobs figures suggested Japan is facing its worst postwar slump in the current quarter, a period when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state of emergency requesting citizens to stay home and businesses to close.
Although the emergency was lifted in late May, the economy is expected to recover only moderately in coming months, underlining the pandemic's sweeping impact.
The surge in bank lending, shown in BOJ data also released on Monday, suggests companies are being forced to hoard cash just to stay afloat - and that the worst is yet to come.
The head of Japan's ANA Holdings Inc said the airline will cut unprofitable international routes to cope with the hit from the pandemic, according to the Asahi newspaper.
Tokyo policymakers are moving fast to stop the bleeding.
Japan's parliament will begin deliberating on Monday a second supplementary budget to fund part of a fresh $1.1 trillion stimulus package that includes loan schemes and a framework to inject capital into struggling firms.
The BOJ eased monetary policy for two straight months in April, focusing on steps to ease corporate funding strains.
The central bank will scrutinise at its rate review next week whether additional steps are needed. But it is seen maintaining its projection of a moderate economic recovery in the latter half of this year, sources said.
A surprise calm in markets could offer Japanese policymakers some breathing space before considering bolder steps.
Japanese shares climbed to a 3-1/2-month high on Monday after an unexpected increase in U.S. employment gave investors further confidence of a swift global recovery.
""If you look at the Japanese stock market, it certainly suggests that additional monetary easing is not necessary,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.

""The BOJ has already done a lot to respond to the immediate crisis.""

Investing.com – China presented a mixed picture of its economic recovery from the COVID-19 virus in its trade data released on Sunday.
Exports in May contracted 3.3% year-on-year according to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics, against analyst forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicting a fall of 7%. April exports contracted by 3.5%.
Imports shrank 16.7% year-on-year, a much larger fall from the predicted 9.7% fall as well as April’s figure of –14.2%.
Meanwhile, China's trade balance was $62.93 billion, compared to analyst forecasts of $39 billion and the $45.33 billion figure in April.
The data suggested that although the domestic recovery continues, with the economic engine restarted in April after months of lockdown, the global recovery is taking longer to catch up.
Countries are slowly starting to restart economic activity after loosening their own lockdowns, but countries such as South Korea are dealing with new outbreak clusters, prompting fears of a second wave of infections.
There are now over 7 million cases of COVID-19 globally as of June 8, and over 400,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University."

The Cabinet Office’s revised report on Monday showed gross domestic product shrank an annualized 2.2% compared with the last quarter of 2019, better than an initial estimate of a 3.4% contraction. Economists had a expected a revision to minus 2.1%.
The result still means Japan’s economy has shrunk for a two straight quarters with an even sharper drop expected in the April-June period. Even before the revision was released, economists were casting doubt on its accuracy.
Japan revises its preliminary GDP data to incorporate investment figures from a business survey that’s published later. This time, a low response rate amid the pandemic may have skewed the results, the finance ministry said this month after the survey showed an unexpected gain in capital spending last quarter.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>","UK shopper numbers indicate huge pent-up demand, Springboard says","LONDON (Reuters) - The number of British shoppers in early June indicate ""a huge amount"" of pent-up demand amongst consumers for shopping in physical stores as the coronavirus lockdown is eased, industry data showed on Monday.
Britain went into lockdown on March 23 to slow the spread of the pandemic, with all retail stores deemed non-essential forced to close.
Some home stores and garden centres re-opened in mid-May and outdoor markets and car showrooms were allowed to open from June 1. All other non-essential retailers are set to follow from June 15 if the government's social-distancing requirements are met.
""The limited evidence so far has suggested that, despite the growth in online shopping over the past two months, there is a huge amount of pent-up demand amongst consumers for bricks-and-mortar shopping,"" said Diane Wehrle, director of market researcher Springboard.
She highlighted the ""monumental queues"" that built up at major home stores in the weekend before the official easing of lockdown restrictions in England on June 1.
Springboard found shopper numbers, or footfall, strengthened noticeably in retail parks over the first few days of the week following this, with the year-on-year decline averaging 42.9% versus 56.2% over the same days at the beginning of May.
For example, thousands of shoppers across England queued up for the re-opening of IKEA stores on June 1.
But Springboard noted that while retail parks were seeing some recovery in footfall, this was not the case for high streets and shopping centres, where the year-on-year decline in footfall over the few days since June 1 was still over 70.0%.
For the May 3 to May 30 period, overall UK footfall was down 73.3%, up from a record low of 80.1% in April, Springboard said.

An industry survey on Friday showed retail sales plunged by nearly a fifth in May.

The sombre trade readings for the world's second-biggest economy could pile pressure on policymakers to roll out more support for a sector that is critical to the livelihoods of more than 180 million workers. Total trade accounts for about a third of the economy. 
Overseas shipments in May fell 3.3% from a year earlier, after a surprising 3.5% gain in April, customs data showed on Sunday. That compared with a 7% drop forecast in a Reuters poll.
While exports fared slightly better than expected, imports tumbled 16.7% compared with a year earlier, worsening from a 14.2% decline the previous month and marking the sharpest decline since January 2016. 
It had been expected to fall 9.7% in May. 
""Exports benefited from the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) market and exchange rate depreciation, while imports were affected by insufficient domestic demand and commodity price declines,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist of Zhongyuan Bank. 
As a result, China posted a record trade surplus of $62.93 billion last month, the highest since Reuters started tracking the series in 1981, compared with the poll's forecast for a $39 billion surplus and $45.34 billion surplus in April.
China's trade surplus with the United States widened to $27.89 billion in May, Reuters calculation based on customs data showed.
This comes as Sino-U.S. tensions are again on the rise, though sources say President Donald Trump has little choice but to stick with a Phase 1 trade deal for now.
EXPORT HEADWINDS
Both official and private factory surveys for May showed sub-indexes for export orders remained deep in contraction. Profits at China's industrial firms fell almost 30% in the January-April period.
Analysts said bright spots like exports of medical supplies, of which China has dominated the supply chain, masked the strong headwinds faced by exporters stuck with unsold stock and cancelled orders from abroad. []
In the first half of May, China shipped 63.2 billion yuan of medical supplies, Reuters calculations from customs data showed, compared with 71.2 billion yuan in the March-April period.
""Even though the export performance exceeded expectations, the difficulties faced by traditional trade enterprises should not be ignored,"" said Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management.
Highlighting the uncertain outlook, the Chinese government said in late May it was not setting an annual growth target, for the first time since 2002, reflecting a cautious stance on policy easing, although some expect domestic demand to bounce back somewhat, while export conditions remain unpredictable. 
The economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier.
""In the future exports will basically see negative growth, but it is not necessary to be too pessimistic. It should be within -10%,"" Zhang said. 

""Imports are subject to greater uncertainty, depending on the recovery of domestic market demand and the implementation of the Phase 1 agreement between China and the United States,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy unexpectedly added jobs in May after suffering record losses in the prior month, offering the clearest signal yet that the downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic was probably over, though the road to recovery could be long.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed the jobless rate falling to 13.3% last month from 14.7% in April, a post World War Two high. But the improvement was unequal, with the unemployment rate for whites posting a record decline, but rising for blacks and Asians.
The report followed on the heels of surveys showing consumer confidence, manufacturing and services industries stabilizing. Businesses have reopened after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19.
""The country has turned the corner from the pandemic and the recession it created for now, but all the workers who lost their paychecks will find it difficult to regain their place in society as many of these jobs are gone forever,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""It took years for the economy to grow enough to find jobs for those unemployed in the last recession, and it will take years again this time to do the same.""
The survey of establishments showed nonfarm payrolls rose by 2.509 million jobs last month after a record plunge of 20.7 million in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls falling by 8 million jobs. They had expected the survey of households to show the unemployment rate jumping to 19.8%. 
President Donald Trump, who had a turbulent week amid nationwide protests over police brutality and racial inequality, quickly took credit for the surprise labor market turnaround.
""Really Big Jobs Report. Great going President Trump (kidding but true)!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
The unemployment rate for blacks increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 16.8%. In contrast, the jobless rate for whites fell to 12.4% from 14.2% in April. Economists believe the unemployment rate peaked in May, but see it remaining above 10% when Americans head to the polls on Nov. 3. 
Stocks on Wall Street rallied on the report. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
DEEP HOLE
Even with May's rebound, the hole is deep. Part-time workers accounted for two-fifths of the increase in employment. Payrolls are nearly 20 million below their pre-COVID-19 level. The unemployment rate has risen 9.8 percentage points and the number of unemployed is up 15.2 million since February.
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the employment report, also noted a continuing problem with misclassification by respondents. A large number of people misclassified themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this misclassification, the May unemployment rate would have been about 16%. 
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dipped to 21.2% in May from 22.8% in April.
The sharp rebound in employment is in stark contrast to a persistently high number of people filing weekly claims for jobless benefits.
Economists said the government's Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, offering businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee salaries, artificially juiced employment. They noted many sectors added jobs in May, though businesses remained shut.
""Once the PPP money runs out, there could be another round of layoffs especially in services which was a big beneficiary of the government program,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a business economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
(Graphic - Which sectors gained jobs in May?: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlwarjpb/Pasted%20image%201591362507986.png)
Employment in May was boosted by restaurants and bars, which added 1.4 million jobs after losing 6 million in April and March. But payrolls continued to decline in the accommodation industry in May, with another 148,000 jobs lost. 
Hiring in the construction industry increased by 464,000 jobs last month, recouping about half of April's decline. There were also gains in employment in education and health services, retail trade, manufacturing, professional and business services, financial activities and wholesale trade.
But government payrolls dropped by 585,000 in May, with the declines in state and local governments, whose budgets have been crushed in the fight against COVID-19. There were more job losses in the information, mining, transportation and warehousing industries.
The labor force participation rate, the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to 60.8% last month from 60.2% in April, which was the lowest rate since January 1973. The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, rose to 52.8% from a record low 51.3% in April. 

With the rebound in lower-wage industry jobs, average hourly earnings fell 1.0% after shooting up 4.7% in April. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 6.7% in May from 8.0% in April. The workweek averaged 34.7 hours, up from 34.2 hours.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's government estimated national income could fall by 23.7 trillion pesos ($6.58 billion) this year, as the coronavirus lockdown and low oil prices batter the Andean country's economy.
The country could issue international and local bonds or use an available line of credit with the International Monetary Fund to help make up for lost income, the government said in a Thursday decree published on Friday.
""Those resources will be monetized to settle the lack of cash flow in pesos,"" the decree said.
Income will fall because the months-long coronavirus quarantine halted much of the economy, the decree said. Though many sectors are gradually reopening, tax collection - especially sales tax - is expected to take a significant hit.
The Finance Ministry has estimated the economy will contract by some 5.5% this year.
Colombia could more than make up for the fall, raising some 23.85 trillion pesos from a variety of sources, the decree said.
Some 15.54 trillion pesos can be raised via international bond issues, the decree said, another 2.64 trillion pesos via issues of so-called TES local bonds and 124 billion pesos from funds from natural gas.
Other sources could provide the remaining 5.54 trillion pesos. Last month the IMF approved a two-year flexible credit line of about $10.8 billion for Colombia, replacing an expiring facility.
Bancolombia (NYSE:CIB), CitiBank and BBVA (MC:BBVA) will structure an issue of 30-year TES, director of public credit Cesar Arias said, adding the government hopes to raise at least 2 trillion pesos with the paper.
""We want to focus on launching the first 30-year Colombian TES bond, with a mind to expand those obligations with time and seek the best possible rates,"" Arias said in a statement on Friday.
Colombia issued $2.5 billion in 2031 and 2051 international bonds on Monday, after receiving interest for $13.3 billion.

The price of transportation, hotels and restaurants all dropped, as did such staples as chicken and beer. The price of food and non-alcoholic beverages overall stayed steady versus the previous year, the agency said.
The numbers snuffed out early concerns that price gouging would dominate markets as panic over the pandemic and potential shortages set in, Finance Minister Ignacio Briones said.
""This is good news for families, because what interests us ... is that they hope they can maintain their purchasing power,"" Briones in a video statement.
Annual inflation hit 2.8%, tending towards the low end of the central bank´s 2% to 4% target range as prices have sagged.
Santander (MC:SAN) said in an analyst´s note the numbers reflected low inflationary pressure overall in Chile, the result of bargain fuel prices and plummeting demand in the tourism and service sectors.
""Going forward, we project that the monthly price increases will be limited...and the annual variation...could close the year again close to 2%,"" the bank said.
Chile, long hailed as one of Latin America´s most stable economies, is now in the throes of the pandemic, reporting nearly more than 120,000 total coronavirus cases and nearly 1,500 deaths. The crisis has devastated the economy of the world's top copper producer.
Economic activity plunged 14.1% in April from the same month a year ago, the central bank said on Monday, the steepest drop in at least 34 years.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada unexpectedly gained 289,600 jobs in May even as the jobless rate hit a record high at 13.7%, data showed on Friday, buoyed by the loosening of stay-at-home restrictions in parts of the country.
The job gains were far better than expected. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a loss of 500,000 jobs and an unemployment rate of 15.0%.
""I think this probably counts as the largest job gain in Canadian history for one month, but it's also still just a drop in the bucket in terms of recovering the lost jobs over March and April,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC. Canada lost a record-breaking 2 million jobs in April. 
The Canadian dollar  climbed to a three-month high at 1.3395 per U.S. dollar or 74.65 U.S. cents. The United States, Canada's largest trading partner, also posted surprise gains for May.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday the government has approved more than 300,000 applications for its wage subsidy program, which he said was keeping ""millions"" employed, and that roughly 1.2 million Canadians who had been receiving federal income support each month no longer need it. 
""This is encouraging news, but we're nowhere near done,"" he said. 
The May data did not capture the 1.4 million people who temporarily lost their jobs due to COVID-19 closures, but are not currently looking for employment, StatsCan said. Had those numbers been counted, the May unemployment rate would have been 19.6% rather than 13.7%.
The record jobless rate was driven in part by students entering the summer job market who must be actively seeking work to get government COVID-19 benefits. The unemployment rate for returning students surged to 40.3 percent compared with 13.8 percent in May 2019, Statscan said.

Employment in the goods producing sector gained 164,700 jobs, while services sector gained 124,900 positions.

Investing.com -- The U.S. jobless rate fell surprisingly in May to 13.3% from 14.7% in April, confounding expectations that the layoffs caused by coronavirus lockdowns would drive it to a new post-WW2 high. 
The Labor Department said nonfarm payrolls rose by 2.509 million in the month through mid-May, compared to expectations for a decline of 8.00 million among economists polled by Investing.com. 
Almost all sectors of the economy posted gains in employment, from manufacturing to health and education. The biggest gains, however, were claimed by the leisure and hospitality sector, where 1.24 million net jobs were added. The exceptions to the trend were government, which shed 555,000 jobs, and information, which shed 38,000. 
Analysts said the figures underlined the extreme volatility of developments since the explosion of the Covid-19 pandemic, and that such volatility may not be over yet.

MADRID (Reuters) - The easing of Spain's coronavirus lockdown led Spaniards to spend with gusto in May after halting buying for a month and a half, bank-card transaction data from Spain's second-largest bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) showed on Friday.
Spending rose 8% in May in provinces which reached Phase 2,a more advanced stage of Spain's four-part de-escalation plan. In some provinces, spending rose 16%. By comparison, total bank-card transactions in shops fell 60% in April year-on-year. 
Spending on food, domestic appliances, health, books and media drove the increase. Leisure and travel showed no signs of revival as the two industries were all but paralysed.
The easing of restrictions also hurt online spending, which only represented 15% of total consumption, versus 18% in the same period last year.
Consumer spending in areas that remained in Phase 1 did not improve, contracting by roughly 10% in the final week of May, BBVA said. 
Spain has suffered one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks, with 27,133 deaths and 240,660 confirmed cases so far. The economy, which relies heavily on tourism and hospitality, contracted 5.2% in the first quarter.
If Spain's economy shrinks by 13.5% in 2020 -- the most pessimistic projection -- the risk of insolvency for Spain's businesses could triple, and in the worst-affected sectors even multiply by a factor of eight, McKinsey's Global Institute said on Friday.

Small and medium companies account for a larger part of Spanish economy than the European Union average -- 47% of Spain's workforce is employed in companies with fewer than 20 employees -- and are especially vulnerable to economic crises, McKinsey added.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Orders for German industrial goods fell 25.8% in April, suffering their biggest drop since records began in 1991, but the low point has probably passed for the backbone of Europe's largest economy, the Economy Ministry said on Friday.
Official figures showed that domestic orders dropped 22.3% while orders from abroad were down 28.1%. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 19.7% fall in orders overall.
""In view of the gradual easing (in coronavirus restrictions), however, the low point of the industrial recession should now have passed,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Germany is facing the prospect of its deepest recession since World War Two, even though a lockdown that had shuttered shops, businesses and factories is now being eased.
The national central bank, the Bundesbank, said the economy will shrink significantly this year and may need two years to make up the lost ground.
The economy will contract by 7.1% in 2020 based on calendar- adjusted figures and 6.8% according to unadjusted data, the Bundesbank said in its biannual projections.
A survey by the economic institute Ifo published on Friday indicated that half of German companies had postponed investments in May while 28% cancelled investment projects completely as the coronavirus pandemic takes its toll.
""These are worrying figures for the long-term development of the economy,"" said Klaus Wohlrabe, Ifo's head of surveys.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has tried to mitigate the impact of the crisis with a range of steps, including a 130 billion euro ($148 billion) stimulus package agreed on Wednesday to speed up recovery.
""Public finances make a significant contribution to stabilisation,"" Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said.
""New stimulus is appropriate in the current situation and I view the government's economic stimulus programme favourably.""
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told Focus Online magazine that Germany should return to a balanced budget in the next legislative period.
On Thursday, Altmaier said the new economic package would be the biggest since the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949.
""The economy has not yet bottomed out,"" he added. ""In the coming weeks and months we will experience difficult moments together. There is light at the end of the tunnel.""
Altmaier said he was aiming for a return to growth in the second half of this year, and for the economy to regain pre-crisis levels ""in the second half of 2022 at the latest"".

559,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>",German Factories See Record Drop in Demand ,"(Bloomberg) -- German factories experienced a record decline in demand in April, underscoring the brutal hit Europe’s largest economy sustained from the shuttering of businesses to rein in the pandemic.
The 25.8% drop in orders is just one indicator measuring the damage. The Bundesbank will offer a fuller picture when it presents its forecasts later on Friday.
While some indicators suggest the economy has already passed the worst, rising unemployment is threatening to delay the recovery -- a scenario the German government is trying to prevent with sweeping fiscal stimulus.
Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled a 130 billion-euro ($148) package focused on fueling consumption and infrastructure investment this week, taking total spending to more than 1.3 trillion euros, by far the most in the European Union.
The European Central Bank added its own dose of support on Thursday with another 600 billion euros in asset purchases that will stretch to the middle of next year. Despite those efforts, it sees the 19-nation euro economy shrinking 8.7% in 2020.
German factories producing investment goods suffered particularly in April, with orders plummeting more than 30%.
The Economy Ministry said in view of the gradual easing of lockdown measures, the low point of the industrial recession should have been overcome.
More than 600,000 people have already lost their jobs, and some 7 million more are on temporary state-wage support. With public life slowly resuming across the country, businesses are counting on an improvement in the second half.
The Bundesbank said last month there’s “a lot to suggest” that momentum has already started to pick up, even though the overall decline in output in the current quarter will be steeper than the 2.2% recorded in the January-March period."

Analysts predict the economy is on course for its worst postwar slump in the current quarter as the coronavirus outbreak forced people to stay at home and businesses to close globally.
Japan's Cabinet Office will release revised GDP data at 8:50 a.m. on June 8, Monday, Japan time (2350 GMT on June 7).
The world's third-biggest economy was forecast to have shrunk at an annualised 2.1% in January-March, the poll of 16 analysts showed, less than the 3.4% contraction in preliminary estimates.
That would translate into a fall of 0.5% from the previous quarter after the initial reading of a 0.9% decline.
The poll showed capital expenditure likely grew 1.4% for the quarter, revised up from a 0.5% decline in the initial estimate.
""There is no need to change our views that the economy is in an extremely severe situation. A series of economic indicators in April so far have shown rapid deterioration,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Corporate earnings have also worsened rapidly and uncertainty over the outlook has grown. There is a high chance that firms will refrain from spending.""
Core machinery orders, due on Wednesday, likely tumbled 8.6% in April from the previous month, the biggest fall in five months. 
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending, likely fell 14.0%.
""We expect manufacturers will delay their spending on rapid falls in foreign demand led by the global economic deterioration,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist Japan Research Institute.
The poll also found Japan's current account surplus likely shrank to 480 billion yen ($4.40 billion) in April from 1.97 trillion yen in March, as the pandemic hit exports.
The Bank of Japan's corporate goods prices index (CGPI) likely fell 2.4% from a year earlier in May, the fastest pace of decline since October 2016, worrying signs that the country may return to deflation.
From the previous month, CGPI, which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, was seen down 0.3% in May after a 1.5% fall in April.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending fell at the fastest pace on record in April as the coronavirus shut down travel and dining-out in the world's third-largest economy, and prospects of higher jobs losses chilled consumer sentiment.
The dismal number will keep policymakers under pressure to prevent a larger decline in the economy, which is expected to fall deeper into recession this quarter.
Household spending tumbled 11.1% in April from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, marking the fastest pace of decline since comparable data became available in 2001.
The decline was slower than a median forecast of a 15.4% fall and followed March's 6.0% decline.
Many analysts expect consumption to have bottomed out in April or May, as businesses re-open after last month's lifting of nationwide lockdowns. But any rebound will be slow and fragile, as companies and households remain wary of spending, they say.
""Unless effective vaccines are developed, a strong recovery cannot be expected for the foreseeable future,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Friday's data showed some winners and losers.
Spending on bars, plane tickets, hotels and amusement parks tanked by around 90% as households were forced to stay home, the data showed.
On the other hand, stay-home policies boosted spending on pasta by 70%, instant noodles by 43% and sanitary goods like face masks by 124%, it showed.
Overall, however, an expected rise in job losses and the hit to household sentiment from the pandemic will weigh on consumption, analysts say.
""A lot of people are out of work and couldn't look for jobs during lockdowns in April. Wages are likely to fall too, which will weigh on consumption,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Japan's economy will rebound in July-September if there's no renewed spike in infections. Even so, it may take until 2023 or 2024 for the economy to return to pre-COVID levels.""
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state of emergency in April requesting citizens to stay home and businesses to close, hammering an economy that was already suffering from the hit from last year's sales tax hike and the U.S.-China trade war.
The government has compiled two stimulus packages worth a combined $2.2 trillion to combat the virus fallout on the economy, which slipped into recession in the first quarter.

While Abe has lifted nationwide lockdowns, analysts expect the economy to suffer an annualised 22% contraction in the current quarter and recover only modestly in the second half of this year. [nL4N2CV1UF]

The monthly index of demand for staff from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) industry body and accountants KPMG rose to 19.3 from April's record low of 9.3. 
Despite the jump, it was a long way from the 50 dividing line between rising and falling demand and it marked the second-worst reading in the survey's 23-year history.
""Given the impact of the lockdown in early May, it's no surprise that these figures look bleak,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
""But in the two weeks since this data was collected, lockdown rules have been eased and the feedback we get from recruiters every day suggests that the slight improvements that we can see in the placements and vacancies data have continued.""
The medical and nursing care sector was the only one to show an increase in demand for staff, the report showed.
Demand in the retail and hotel and catering sectors cratered.
Still, Carberry said he had heard hints of optimism from business leaders.

""With no sign of a rapid V-shaped bounce-back on the cards, consumers remain pessimistic about the state of their finances and the wider economic picture for the year to come,"" GfK's client strategy director Joe Staton said.

Accountancy and business advisory firm BDO said its monthly High Street Sales Tracker (HSST) found total like-for-like sales, consisting of both in-store and non-store (online) sales, declined by 18.3% in May - the second worst result on record after April’s 29.6% decline.
BDO highlighted a 22.6% fall in fashion sales.
Britain went into lockdown on March 23 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, with all retail stores deemed ""non essential"" forced to close. 
However, outdoor markets and car showrooms were allowed to open from June 1 and all other non-essential retail is set to follow from June 15 if the government's social distancing requirements are met.
With many retailers continuing to trade online during the lockdown, BDO recorded a 129.5% year-on-year jump in non-store like-for-like sales - the largest increase since it began measuring in 2010.
“Despite the significant pick-up in ecommerce, the monumental collapse in discretionary spend remains stark as retailers continue to face challenging headwinds,"" said Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's industrial output crashed 33.5% in April from the same month last year, the government's statistics agency said on Thursday, as the national lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic bludgeoned Latin America's No. 3 economy.
It was the sharpest drop in industrial output since the 1990s, when the country was tilting into a financial crisis that would press millions of middle class Argentines into poverty.
More than 580 Argentines have died in the pandemic so far and urban centers remain largely closed to business. Argentina recorded 949 new infections on Wednesday, the highest daily jump since the pandemic began. The country has a total 19,268 cases.
""Other countries with this kind of fall in economy production are in a stage where the epidemic is somehow under control, with a decrease in active cases. Argentina, however, is just starting to see an increase in cases,"" said Gabriel Zelpo, director of local economic consultancy Seido.
He forecast that Argentina's economy will shrink more than 10% this year after recessions of 2.1% in 2019 and 2.5% in 2018.
""The operational limitations resulting from compulsory preventive measures substantially affected industrial activity,"" Argentina's INDEC statistics agency said in a statement announcing the drop in April.
Only about a third of the country's industrial manufacturing base was able to operate normally, the statement said, ""while the remaining two thirds either did not operate or could only operate partially.""
Argentina's construction sector plummeted 75.6% in April from April 2019, government data showed.

Like the economic meltdown that marred Argentina at the start of the 2000s, the country once again finds itself in a sovereign debt default as the government tries to restructure its bonds. The latest default occurred on May 22 when Argentina missed an interest payment of $503 million.

568,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Explainer: No one really knows how many Americans need unemployment benefits,"By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - Another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week, according to data released by the Labor Department on Thursday, marking 11 straight weeks in which millions of Americans have filed claims for jobless benefits. 
But as the economic crisis from coronavirus-related shutdowns continues, it is becoming more difficult to keep track of exactly how many newly out-of-work Americans are receiving or waiting for unemployment benefits, analysts say. 
National ""unemployment insurance weekly claims,"" reported every Thursday by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), and often referred to as ""jobless claims,"" are a key indicator of the health of the U.S. economy. The figure impacts federal budgets and capital flows, and has been a way to gauge the toll of the pandemic on the country's 160 million workers. 
But the simplest way to calculate that impact - tallying up the number of initial unemployment claims filed each week since a national emergency was declared in March, for a total of 42.6 million - is increasingly flawed, analysts say. 
""The more time goes by, summing up initial claims gets a little dicey,"" said Heidi Shierholz, senior economist and director of policy for the Economic Policy Institute.
That's because some people who filed for unemployment benefits early on may have returned to work as businesses reopen, and are no longer receiving them. Other workers who initially filed for traditional unemployment benefits may have switched to a program for independent contract workers and gig workers affected by the pandemic, muddying the waters.
Another way to figure out who needs jobless benefits could be to focus on the number of people who are currently receiving benefits and those who have applied recently, said Shierholz. 
By that measure, 37.2 million Americans were either receiving benefits or applied over the last couple of weeks, she noted. But this approach can be incomplete, too. Some states, including California, only require people currently receiving benefits, known as continued claims, to file every other week.
Confusing things even further is the new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which offers benefits to workers like ride-share drivers, who do not traditionally qualify for unemployment benefits. 
Many states did not get this program up and running until April or May, and there was no data on the programs for 15 states and the District of Columbia in the most recent claims report from the DOL.
That's despite the fact that many states are tracking how many people have applied for and received these benefits on their public state websites. 
There is typically a lag when states report figures on unemployment assistance programs launched during major disasters, said Michele Evermore, a policy analyst with the National Employment Law Project. ""I can see where that would be compounded by dealing with the unusual level of new claims,"" she said. 
Kansas, for example, started paying out PUA benefits the week of May 25 and said it reported numbers to the DOL. Its figures, however, did not appear in the weekly report. Georgia's labor department said the staff is working on a program to report the benefits to the federal government, while Arizona and Florida said the information has not shown up in the national report because they are only required to report it once a month. 
Nonetheless, the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits each week is still in the millions, suggesting the economy continues to experience fresh shocks from the pandemic. 

""Most of this is new unemployment and that's really striking,"" said Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Fed economist. ""It's still really bad.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's unemployment rate during July 2018-June 2019 period declined to 5.8% from 6.1% during a year-earlier period, a government report released on Thursday said.
Joblessness among the youth - those aged between 15-29 years and who account for roughly over a third of India's 1.3 billion people - marginally declined to 17.3% in 2018/19 from 17.8% from a year ago, the report said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi faced a political controversy last year when ahead of national elections, the first extensive annual report for the July 2017-June 2018 period was leaked and published in the Business Standard newspaper. It showed the unemployment rate was the highest in at least 45 years.
Modi’s government officially released the report later.
The latest annual report is based on the periodic labour force survey conducted by the National Statistics Office covering over 100,000 households in rural and urban areas.
Private economists and industry leaders say India's unemployment rate has substantially gone up after the over two-month long lockdown imposed in late March to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
India's unemployment rate in May rose to 23.48%, marginally lower than 23.52% in April, according to data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) on Monday, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
India has reported nearly 217,000 coronavirus cases, with 6,075 deaths.
Asia's third largest economy grew at a pace of 3.1% in the January-March quarter, its slowest pace in at least eight years, and economists have predicted a contraction of up to 5% in the fiscal year that began in April, posing a risk of job cuts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped below 2 million last week for the first time since mid-March, but remains astonishingly high as companies adjust to an environment that has been significantly changed by COVID-19.
Other data on Thursday showed a jump in the trade deficit in April as the pandemic upended the global flow of goods and services, pushing exports to a 10-year low. The reports buttressed expectations the economy's recovery from the coronavirus crisis would be a long slog even as activity appears to be stabilizing.
""The good news is the country may have turned the corner in the coronavirus pandemic, but the bad news is economic growth is going to just limp along if it has to carry millions and millions of jobless workers who cannot support themselves and are running out of benefits to pay the bills,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 249,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.877 million for the week ended May 30, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new claims would drop to 1.8 million in the latest week. 
Though claims have declined since hitting a record 6.867 million in late March, they are three times larger than their peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. Still, the report suggested the worst is over for the labor market, combined with data on Wednesday that showed a smaller-than-expected drop in private payrolls in May.
Surveys have also shown consumer confidence, manufacturing and services industries stabilizing, albeit at low levels in May, indicating the downturn triggered by a near shutdown of the country in mid-March to control the spread of the COVID-19 respiratory illness was bottoming. Many businesses had reopened by mid-May.
The stubbornly high number of unemployment claims comes from a second wave of layoffs as businesses navigate weak demand, as well as some lingering backlogs at state unemployment offices overwhelmed by the flood of applications early in the shutdown.
Boeing (N:BA) and pipeline operator  Energy Transfer  (N:ET) have announced layoffs, while some big retailers like JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ) and high-end chain Neiman Marcus have filed for bankruptcy. States and local governments, whose budgets have been decimated by the COVID-19 fight, are also cutting jobs.
""The evidence of unemployment spreading to other industries and larger companies is clear, and that may slow, or even temporarily reverse, our progress,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. 
The government's closely watched employment report for May, due on Friday, is likely to show nonfarm payrolls falling by 8 million after a record 20.537 million plunge in April, according to a Reuters survey of economists. 
The unemployment rate is forecast to rocket to 19.8%, a post-World War Two record, from 14.7% in April.
TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS
A separate report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit jumped 16.7% to $49.4 billion in April. Exports tumbled a record 20.5% to $151.3 billion, the lowest since April 2010. That offset a record 13.7% drop in imports to $200.7 billion.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower after recent hefty gains. The dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
The weekly jobless claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, could become difficult to parse in the weeks ahead. Initial claims are recorded when a person submits a first application for unemployment benefits. Once approved, they become continuing claims and are reported with a one-week lag.
As part of a fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, the U.S. government greatly expanded eligibility for unemployment benefits to include self-employed and independent contractors who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
These workers do not qualify for the regular state unemployment insurance and must file under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program. 
The government also extended regular state jobless benefits by another 13 weeks under a program called Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC). Roughly 30 states are now reporting PUA claims on a weekly basis, but PEUC figures are reported with a two-week lag. 
Neither PUA nor PEUC are included in the initial claims and continuing claims figures, which economists say grossly understates the tragedy caused by COVID-19. Last week, 623,073 PUA applications were processed on top of the 10.741 million during the week ended May 16. 
Continuing claims, the number of people still receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid, increased 649,000 to 21.487 million in the week ending May 23. Economists believe continuing claims peaked at 24.9 million in early May.
A total of 30 million people were receiving unemployment benefits under all programs in the week ending May 16, slightly down from 31 million in the prior week.

""The (business) re-opening path and the impact on employment may not be as smooth as hoped,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit surged in April as the COVID-19 pandemic upended the global flow of goods and services, pushing exports to a 10-year low. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit jumped 16.7% to $49.4 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap increasing to $49.0 billion in April.
Global lockdowns to slow the spread of COVID-19 have severely disrupted the movement of goods and services between countries, leading to sharp contractions in economic activity. Gross domestic product in the United States declined at a 5.0% annualized rate in the first quarter, the steepest pace of contraction in output since the fourth quarter of 2008.
In April, exports dropped a record 20.5% to $151.3 billion, the lowest since April 2010. Goods exports plunged 25.2% to $95.5 billion, the lowest since September 2009. Exports of motor vehicles and parts fell to $3.8 billion, the lowest since March 1992. Shipments of consumer goods dropped to $10.4 billion, the lowest since April 2006. 
Travel restrictions weighed on exports of services, which resulted in the surplus on the services account narrowing to $22.4 billion, the smallest since December 2016.
Imports dropped a record 13.7% to $200.7 billion, the lowest since July 2010. Goods imports fell 13.6% to $167.4 billion, the lowest since November 2010.
The import number has been shrinking as the United States waged a trade war with China. A sharp reduction in crude oil imports has also been a factor, with the United States becoming an oil exporter last year. The country posted a record $3.2 billion petroleum surplus in April.

In April, imports of automotive vehicles, parts, and engines dropped to $13.3 billion, the lowest since July 2009. Consumer goods imports fell to $43.8 billion, the lowest since August 2013. Petroleum imports declined to $6.1 billion, the lowest since June 1999.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits totaled 1.88 million in the week ending May 30, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday, but the number of continuing claims surprisingly rose, in a sign that re-hiring isn't necessarily keeping up with the pace of new job losses.
The initial claims number was broadly in-line with forecasts and was down from 2.12 million in the prior week.This was the first time this figure had fallen below 2 million since late March. Claims have been gradually decreasing since hitting a record 6.86 million in the week ended March 28.
However, continuing claims, which show the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, came in above expectations at 21.49 million in the week ended May 23, up slightly from 21.05 million a week earlier.
Continuing claims figures are reported with a one-week delay but are considered offering a better view of the labor market.
The figures out each week have gained renewed attention for quickly showing the depth of the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic, as well as signs that a recovery is starting as business restrictions ease. 
They are seen as particularly important this week following the better than expected gauge of private-sector employment from ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) on Wednesday, and ahead of Friday’s official monthly employment report.

Sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro zone fell by 11.7% in April from March and by 19.6% year-on-year, EU statistics agency Eurostat said on Thursday.
That compared with market expectations of 15.0% and 22.3% declines respectively, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
The month-on-month decline was the steepest in Eurostat data going back to 1999, going beyond the previous record from March of -11.1%.
The year-on-year change, which before March had not been negative since the end of 2013, was the worst on record in data reaching back to 2000. It was also four times the size of the decline in February 2009, the worst month of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
The only brighter spot was a sharp 10.9% month-on-month rise in mail order and internet shopping.
Even sales of food, drinks and tobacco and of pharmaceuticals and medical goods were down, although the former set was up year-on-year after large-scale stockpiling in March.
The sharpest sales declines were for automotive fuel and for clothing, footwear and textiles.
The steepest month-on-month falls by country were in Malta and Ireland, the latter after a slight increase in March. Compared with the previous year, the biggest drops were in France and Spain. There was no April data for Cyprus, Greece and Italy.
Finland was the only country to register an increase, with sales going up 0.3% from March.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction PMI rose to 28.9 from April's record low of 8.2, still a long way below the 50 dividing line for growth and the third-worst reading in the survey's 23-year history.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a slightly stronger reading of 29.7.
""A gradual restart of work on site helped to alleviate the downturn in total UK construction output during May, but the latest survey highlighted that ongoing business closures and disruptions across the supply chain held back the extent of recovery,"" Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
Business expectations in the construction sector were still in the red, in contrast with manufacturing and services companies who are already looking forward to better times, the report showed.
""Survey respondents often commented on the cancellation of new projects and cited concerns that clients would scale back spending through the second half of 2020, especially in areas most exposed to a prolonged economic downturn,"" Moore said.

The all-sector PMI, which combines Britain's construction survey with those for the manufacturing and services sector published earlier this week, rose to 29.9 in May from 13.4 in April.

Car showrooms in England have only been able to reopen to potential buyers since Monday, though some vehicles were delivered direct to customers last month and in April.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales suffered a historic plunge in April while the trade surplus narrowed as the coronavirus battered the economy, leaving the nation facing its worst ever contraction in the current quarter.
Retail sales slumped a seasonally adjusted 17.7% in April, their biggest on record, from an 8.5% jump in March, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Thursday.
Cafes, restaurants, clothing and footwear posted record falls.
Separate data showed exports dropped 11% and imports 10% in some of the largest declines in years. 
With much of the world in recession, exports of everything from iron ore to coal to gold took a hit in the month.
On the import side the biggest swing was in tourism as globe-trotting Australians were barred from going abroad due to the pandemic.
That saw debits on tourism shrink to just A$49 million in April from A$2.8 billion in March and A$4.3 billion in February, boosting the monthly trade balance.
In contrast, tourism exports dropped only modestly to A$3.3 billion, in part due to spending by tens of thousands of overseas students still in the country.
The net result was that the country's trade surplus narrowed 16% to A$8.8 billion in April, but still handily beat forecasts of A$7.5 billion. 
Australia implemented strict social distancing rules in mid-March to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing many businesses to close. Though some restrictions have eased this month economists say it will be a while before activity returns to pre-crisis levels.
Analysts are predicting Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) could fall roughly 8% in the current quarter, with the dive in April retail sales alone subtracting 2.1 percentage point off GDP. 
That would leave the economy facing its first recession in nearly three decades following the 0.3% contraction last quarter.
To blunt the hit, Australia's central bank has slashed interest rates to a record low 0.25% and launched an unlimited quantitative easing programme while the federal government has stepped in with a large fiscal support plan too. 
Those stimulus measures seem to be working.
 Scentre  Group (AX:SCG), which owns and operates Westfield malls in Australia and New Zealand, said last week customer visitation had ""steadily increased"" across all its centres throughout May, coinciding with more retailers re-opening stores and government restrictions gradually easing.

Separately, ANZ Bank said in the week to May 27, total ANZ-observed debit and credit card spending was up 3.3% from a year ago, including retail spending growth of 25%.

The shortfall is the biggest since January 2011. It was largely in line with expectations by the government and the markets as annual dividend payments by local companies to their shareholders were mostly made during the same month.

In the eight months of outflows from August last year through April, a net $55.3 billion flowed out of Brazil.
The figures for May show that the central bank sold a net $520 million of currency reserves, and commercial banks reduced their net short dollar cash position to $25.5 billion, the lowest in six months.

Shop prices fell by 2.4% in annual terms, following a 1.7% drop in April, the British Retail Consortium trade body and market research firm Nielsen said.
It was the biggest fall since the BRC records began in 2006.
Clothing and furniture saw the sharpest price drops while food prices increased slightly due to higher business costs, implementing social distancing measures and labour shortages in the industry.
""We expect to see continued upward pressure on food prices from the effects of the pandemic in the coming months, while non-food prices are likely to remain deflationary with subdued sales,"" Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said.
Britain's most closely watched inflation rate fell to 0.8% in April and could go negative soon, according to Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls fell less than expected in May, suggesting layoffs were abating as businesses reopen, though the overall economy's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic will be slow.
Signs are growing that the economic slump is nearing a bottom, with other data on Wednesday showing activity in the vast services sector pushing off an 11-year low in May. Getting the economy back to pre-COVID-19 levels could take years unless businesses boost spending after cutting back for four straight quarters. Factory orders suffered a record drop in April.
""The road ahead is fraught with significant downside risks,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Severe demand destruction, supply chain disruptions, tighter financial conditions, and concerns of a second wave of coronavirus contagion minimize chances of a strong rebound.""
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private employers laid off another 2.76 million workers last month after a record 19.557 million in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls dropping by 9 million in May. 
A staggering 25 million private jobs were lost over the past three months. The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Last month's smaller-than-expected drop in private payrolls mirrored declines in the number of people filing claims for unemployment benefits and remaining on jobless rolls.
""The COVID-19 recession is over, barring a second wave of infections or policy error,"" Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics chief economist told reporters. ""It was the shortest recession in history and among the most severe. But recovery will be a slog until there is a vaccine.""
Recessions in the United States are called by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, the NBER looks for a drop in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months. Economists believe the economy slipped into recession in March.
The ADP report showed job losses across all sectors in May, though within the service-providing sector, administrative services, which include temporary help, and educational services showed employment gains.
Zandi said there was no evidence yet the government's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was helping the labor market. The PPP, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, offers businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if they are used for employee pay.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index rose to a reading of 45.4 in May from 41.8 in April, which was the lowest since March 2009 and the first showing contraction since December 2009. 
A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists had forecast the index increasing to a reading of 44.0 in May.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors remained optimistic about an economic rebound despite growing social unrest. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
WORST OVER
Though the worst of job losses is probably behind, economists estimate that roughly one in four workers who were laid off or furloughed during the near shutdown of the country in mid-March to control the spread of COVID-19 were unlikely to be rehired. Several retailers have filed for bankruptcy and many other businesses are expected to follow suit.
The ADP report was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for May scheduled to be published on Friday. Though it has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report because of methodology differences, it was broadly consistent with other labor market indicators.
""The ADP report isn't always a reliable predictor of the government data, but it suggests that the pace of job loss moderated noticeably between April and May, even though it remained substantial relative to pre-COVID-19 norms,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
(GRAPHIC: How good is ADP at predicting the U.S. jobs report? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxdaxdpx/Pasted%20image%201591201892579.png) 
Still, the ADP report likely exaggerates the pace of easing in layoffs. The ISM survey showed its measure of services industry employment rising marginally in May from April's reading, which was the lowest since 1997.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably declined by 8 million last month after plummeting by a record 20.537 million in April. 
The unemployment rate is forecast rocketing to 19.8%, a post-World War Two high, from 14.7% in April.
Demand and business confidence will determine how quickly the labor market recovers. A third report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed factory orders slumped a record 13% in April after dropping 11% in March.

""Many companies operating on the slimmest of margins may find they are unable to generate enough revenue to stay in business,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday factory orders dropped 13.0% after falling 11.0% in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders diving 14% in April. 
Factory orders fell 8.0% year-on-year in April. But the slump in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of U.S. economic activity, probably is close to bottoming. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that its measure of national factory activity eased from an 11-year low in May.
The sector remains hobbled by supply chain disruptions following business closures around the globe to slow the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing measures at factories as they reopen are also hurting production. Cheaper crude oil, which has eroded profits in the energy sector, is also weighing on manufacturers of drilling equipment.
Unfilled orders at factories dropped 1.6% in April after falling 2.1% in March. Inventories at factories slipped 0.4% in April, while shipments of manufactured goods plummeted 13.5%.
Transportation equipment orders collapsed 48.3% in April after plunging 43.2% in the prior month. There were no civilian aircraft orders, while bookings for motor vehicles and parts tumbled 29.3%. Machinery orders fell 7.2% in April. 
Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components declined 9.0%.
The government also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, declined 6.1% in April instead of falling 5.8% as reported last month.

Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, fell 5.7% in April, instead of decreasing 5.4% as previously reported. Business investment has contracted for four straight quarters.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index rose to a reading of 45.4 last month from 41.8 in April, which was the lowest since March 2009 and first contraction since December 2009. 
A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index increasing to a reading of 44.0 in May.
The report came on the heels of the ISM's manufacturing survey on Monday showing factory activity easing off an 11-year low in May. Sentiment surveys have suggested the slump in economic activity triggered by COVID-19 has bottomed. 
The economy contracted at a 5% annualized rate in the first quarter, the worst performance since the 2007-09 recession. Gross domestic product is expected to decline at a rate as sharp as 40% in the second quarter, which would the biggest contraction in output since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry increased to a reading of 41.9 in May from 32.9 in April, which was the weakest since the series started in 1997. The survey's index of services industry employment edged up to 31.8 last month from 30.0 in April, which was the lowest since 1997.
That points to the distress in the labor market, which is expected to be underscored by the government's closely watched employment report for May, scheduled to be released on Friday. 

According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely dropped by 8 million jobs last month after a historic 20.537 million plunge in April. The unemployment rate is forecast rocketing to 19.7%, a post-World War Two high, from 14.7% in April.

Investing.com - The U.S. private sector shed another 2.76 million jobs in May, according to a report by payrolls processor ADP, indicating that it could take the economy a while to rebound as businesses reopen.
Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected the private sector to have shed 9 million jobs last month.
April’s figure was revised to show job losses of 19.55 million from the decline of 20.23 million that was initially reported.
“The impact of the COVID-19 crisis continues to weigh on businesses of all sizes,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, cohead of the ADP Research Institute. “While the labor market is still reeling from the effects of the pandemic, job loss likely peaked in April, as many states have begun a phased reopening of businesses.”
The ADP numbers come ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for May on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
That report is expected to show that the unemployment rate rose to around 20% last month with employers forecast to have cut 8.25 million jobs, compared with the record 20.5 million jobs lost in April.
Ahead of that, Thursday’s jobless claims report is expected to show another surge of new claims for unemployment benefits.
Claims have declined steadily since hitting a record 6.86 million in late March, but have not registered below 2 million since mid-March.
A record 40.76 million people have filed claims since March 21. The economy created 22 million jobs during the employment boom which started in September 2010 and abruptly ended in February this year.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 euro countries fell 2.0% month-on-month in April for a 4.5% year-on-year decline. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.8% monthly and a 4.0% annual fall.
The decrease was mainly a result of a plunge in energy prices, which tumbled 7.5% month-on-month for a 16.5% year-on-year fall. Without this highly volatile component, producer prices eased only 0.3% both on a monthly and a yearly basis.
Producer prices are a key factor shaping consumer inflation, which the European Central Bank wants to keep below but close to 2% over the medium term, as changes in prices at factory gates largely translate into the final cost for consumers.
Also important for inflation and therefore ECB monetary policy is the unemployment rate, which shows trends in consumer demand and therefore rising or falling inflationary pressure.
Eurostat said the number of people that lost their jobs in the euro zone in April was 211,000, bringing the number of the unemployed to 11.919 million or 7.3% of the workforce, up from 7.1% in March.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a jump to 8.2%, but their forecast was based on previous Eurostat data for March, which the statistics office now revised to 7.1% from the previously reported 7.4%.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic further hit Germany's labour market in May as companies continued to slash thousands of jobs and put millions of employees on reduced working hours, data showed on Wednesday.
The bleak figures, published by the Labour Office, came as Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition wrestled over the final details of a stimulus package to help firms and employees in Europe's largest economy recover quickly from the crisis.
The number of people out of work in May rose by 238,000 to 2.875 million in seasonally adjusted terms, the data showed. A Reuters poll had predicted a rise of 200,000.
The unemployment rate jumped to 6.3% from 5.8% in April.
""The labour market remains under immense pressure due to the coronavirus pandemic,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said. But he added that unemployment did not rise as much as in April.
Companies logged requests to put 1.06 million people on reduced working hours under the government's Kurzarbeit short-time working scheme from May 1 to May 27, the office said.
That was in addition to requests for 10.66 million people made in March and April combined, the labour office said, adding that this did not, however, mean that all of those people would actually end up on the scheme.
""Short-time work has clearly exceeded the level of the 2009 crisis,"" Scheele said. Around 1.5 million people were on the programme back then.
Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll.
A poll by the Ifo economic institute published on Tuesday showed the number of workers in Germany on reduced hours had risen to 7.3 million as the pandemic affects most sectors.

The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) combining Britain's huge services sector and manufacturing rose to 30.0 from 13.8 in April, up from a preliminary May reading of 28.9.
The index for services alone was also slightly higher than the preliminary figure but at 29.0 it was the second-weakest on record after April's crash to 13.4. 
Companies lost orders as clients slashed spending.
""Consumer demand also remained very subdued, with large areas of the service economy still in the planning stage of restarting business operations,"" Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
Expectations rose modestly for a second month from March's low. But businesses dealing face-to-face with customers were extremely concerned that social distancing measures would hold them back and push up costs.
On the positive side, some companies saw new orders from the Asia-Pacific region, where the recovery is more advanced, and from new online sales efforts.
But export orders continued to fall and some services firms said they were not taking work from abroad due to severe restrictions on travel.
Britain's services PMI does not include retailers, who have been hardest hit by store closures since the March 23 lockdown, or many of the self-employed.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the sector rose to 31.1 from a record low of 10.2 in April, when France was in the depths of the lockdown.
The result was better than the 29.4 IHS Markit had flagged in an initial reading, but remained far below the 50-point threshold demarcating an expansion in activity from a contraction.
France entered one of Europe's most stringent lockdowns in mid-March and restrictions remained in place until May 11, with cafes and restaurants only allowed to open for regular business on Tuesday.
The improvement in services helped lift the overall PMI, including already published data from the manufacturing sector. The composite PMI rose to 32.1 from 11.1, topping the 30.5 initially reported. 
""Rates of activity decline at both manufacturers and service providers did ease in May, and we should expect this trend to continue as more and more firms reopen for business,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said. 
""Although we might see further contractions while demand remains subdued, PMI figures should continue to climb in the months ahead barring a second outbreak,"" he added.
The coronavirus crisis has plunged the euro zone's second-biggest economy into its worst recession since World War Two and left many firms struggling to get back on their feet after the lockdown.

Governments across the region have gradually started to lift tough lockdown measures imposed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus which has infected nearly 6.4 million people and killed over 379,000.
But with citizens -- many of whom are facing threats to their incomes as well as their health -- still encouraged to stay at home, and swathes of businesses remaining shuttered, IHS Markit's May Final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) painted a gloomy picture.
Although the survey's headline index jumped to 31.9 from April's 13.6, which had been by far the lowest reading since the survey began in mid-1998, it was a long way from the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. The flash estimate was 30.5.
""The scale and breadth of the euro zone downturn was highlighted by the PMI data showing all countries enduring another month of sharply falling business activity,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Euro zone GDP is consequently set to fall at an unprecedented rate in the second quarter, accompanied by the largest rise in unemployment seen in the history of the euro area.""
A Reuters poll last month predicted the bloc's economy would contract 11.3% this quarter and unemployment would be around 10% each quarter for the rest of this year. 
An index in the PMI covering employment showed firms were cutting jobs at a near-record pace, registering 37.8 compared to April's survey low of 33.4.
""The outlook is scarred by the prospect of demand remaining weak due to household spending being hit by high levels of unemployment and corporate spending being subdued as companies repair balance sheets,"" Williamson said.
""We therefore remain cautious with respect to the recovery.""
A headline index for the bloc's dominant service industry recovered to 30.5 from April's record low of 12.0 but held firmly below the breakeven mark. The flash reading was 28.7.
Demand fell again, and backlogs of work were run down rapidly, yet services firms were far less pessimistic about the 12-month ahead outlook. Their business expectations index jumped to 47.6 from 34.3.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>","Germany's services sector activity improves in May, outlook still bleak: PMI","BERLIN (Reuters) - Activity in Germany's services sector declined at a slower pace in May after a record contraction the previous month as restrictions to contain the coronavirus were lifted, a survey showed on Wednesday.
IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 32.6 from 16.2 in April, higher than a flash reading of 31.4. The composite PMI index, which covers both the services and manufacturing sectors, rose to 32.3 from 17.4 in April. That was higher than a flash figure of 31.4.
The slower decline in activity did not stop companies from remaining downbeat about the outlook, as new business fell sharply in May, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous month.
""The data show that there is still considerable slack in the economy, and point to the real possibility of a double-digit contraction in the second quarter,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""As such, disinflationary forces still are looming large over the private sector economy, with fierce competition among businesses driving down prices charged for goods and services. Lower costs have so far helped facilitate discounting.""
The travel, restaurant and entertainment sectors have been hit hard by lockdown measures that were introduced in March and which lasted well into April.
Even though restaurants, hotels, fitness studios and some entertainment venues have been allowed to reopen under restrictions, economists say a return to pre-crisis levels of business will be slow.
""There was more bad news for the German labour market in May as job losses continued to mount,"" said Smith. ""Staff cuts were initially centred on services at the start of lockdown, but here the rate of decline has eased slightly and now been overtaken by manufacturing.""
The government expects the economy to shrink by 6.3% this year, the deepest recession since World War Two, even though an unprecedented rescue package is cushioning the impact of the pandemic.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy has fallen into recession, the country's treasurer said on Wednesday, after data showed gross domestic product fell last quarter as entire business sectors were closed to fight the coronavirus.
The A$2 trillion ($1.39 trillion) economy contracted 0.3% in the three months ended March, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said, the first decline in nine years.
That took annual growth to 1.4%, the slowest since the 2009 global financial crisis, as the economy was hit by the worst bushfire season in living memory, a prolonged drought and a pandemic that shut down businesses and left many without jobs.
When asked if the country was already in recession, technically defined as two straight quarters of GDP contraction, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg answered in the affirmative.
""Based on what we know from Treasury, we’re going to see a contraction in the June quarter, which is going to be a lot more substantial than what we have seen in the March quarter,"" he told reporters in Canberra.
That would mark Australia's first recession since the early 1990s and end one of the world's longest growth streaks.
Household consumption was the biggest drag on growth last quarter with massive falls in spending on clothing, cars, transport, recreation, hotels, cafes and restaurants.
Net exports and government spending supported the economy in the quarter.
HUMAN TOLL 
The economic fallout deepened in Australia as the number of local coronavirus cases surged from less than 100 in early March to more than 7,000 now, forcing the government to shut borders and restrict large gatherings.
Those curbs hit retailers and upended Australia's labour market with 600,000 people losing work and the unemployment rate spiking to 6.2% in April. The central bank expects unemployment to hit 10% by June and stay elevated for much of 2021.
Gurpreet Singh lost his job at a cafe in Sydney's west after it cut casual worker shifts. His home rental payments have now fallen five weeks into arrears.
To survive, he earns money delivering for UberEats on his pushbike and has turned to free food drives.
""This recession will be particularly bad for us young people,"" Singh, 29, said.
""This money from UberEats is not bad but I am worried about my future. It's going to be hard to find (permanent) work.""
To help cushion the blow to the economy from the pandemic, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) stepped in by cutting the cash rate to a record low 0.25% and launched an unlimited bond buying programme. 
The government, meanwhile, unleashed a large fiscal stimulus plan, including a A$60 billion wage subsidy scheme.
Those stimulus measures are working as expected, RBA Governor Philip Lowe said this week, sounding less gloomy about the economy as health outcomes improved and businesses re-opened earlier-than-expected.
While Australia is in its worst downturn since the Great Depression, economists generally see growth returning in the third quarter.
""There are early signs of this improvement in the timely economic indicators,"" HSBC economist Paul Bloxham said. ""Consumer sentiment is rising. Weekly employment numbers showed a pick-up in some industries... in early May.""
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economist Phil Odonaghoe said Australia has performed well by global comparison, suggesting its luck has not completely run out.
Of 19 rich world countries that have reported first quarter GDP so far, Australia has outdone 17 with only Sweden reporting a quarterly expansion. Those 17 economies fell 2.9% on average compared with Australia's 0.3% decline, Odonaghoe said.
Optimism about a second-half recovery as the economy reopened supported the Aussie dollar . While the currency dipped after the GDP figures, it remained near a five-month peak at $0.6938 on Wednesday afternoon.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's enormous services industry endured another month of devastating contraction in May as the coronavirus brought activity to a near halt, causing steep job losses and cementing fears of a deep recession, a survey showed on Wednesday.
Although the Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index  crawled up to 12.6 in May from April's all-time low of 5.4 it remained a long way from the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. It was just below 50 in March.
The last time it contracted for three consecutive months was from November 2016 following the ban of high-value currency notes, which severely hurt consumption.
The lockdown of India's 1.3 billion people, which started on March 25, has been extended in some areas until the end of June as domestic coronavirus cases reported approached 200,000 with more than 5,500 deaths recorded.
""Given the stringency of the lockdown measures imposed in India, it is no surprise to see the severity of the declines in April and May,"" Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.
""Demand for services, both domestically and overseas, continued to plummet in May as clients' businesses remained closed and footfall remains drastically below normal levels.""
Although slightly improved from April sub-indexes tracking domestic and foreign demand remained perilously close to zero, leading firms to reduce their workforce at the second sharpest pace since the survey began late 2005. It has only been faster in April.
The outlook gave little hope for an imminent turnaround with firms reporting record low levels of confidence about the next 12 months.
A composite PMI, which includes manufacturing and services, also signalled a severe contraction in Asia's third-largest economy. [ECILT/IN]

""With economic output set to fall enormously in the first half of 2020, it is clear that the recovery to pre-COVID-19 levels of GDP is going to be very slow,"" IHS Markit's Hayes wrote.

596,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 01:04AM ET</span>",China’s Services Sector Reports Return to Growth,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s services sector returned to growth for the first time in five months in May, but a complete economic recovery from the COVID-19 virus could still take time.
The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) for May was 55, the highest reading in almost a decade. The figure was well above the reading of 44 for April, as well as above the 50-mark indicating expansion.
This return to growth was driven by rising domestic new business despite export orders falling for the fourth consecutive month.
The survey, which focuses more on small, export-oriented companies in the private sector, corroborate an official survey released earlier in the week which indicated increasing momentum in the services and construction sectors.
The National Bureau of Statistics announced on Sunday that the Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI for May was 50.7, indicating expansion in the manufacturing sector as well. But weak global demand, as countries continue to be impacted by COVID-19, slowed growth in the manufacturing sector comparative to services.
“Demand for services recovered more strongly than that for manufacturing, which was more constrained by sluggish exports amid the ongoing impact of the pandemic’s spread outside China,” Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, told Reuters.
Caixin’s composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, was 54.5 in May compared to April’s 47.6.
But the return to growth in both sectors is overshadowed by the economy shrinking 6.8% in the first quarter year-on-year, as well as the government not setting an annual growth target for the first time in almost two decades during the National People’s Congress in late May.
""In general, the improvement in supply and demand was still not able to fully offset the fallout from the pandemic, and more time is needed for the economy to get back to normal,” said Wang.
Meanwhile, the current biggest concern in the country is unemployment with the survey indicating that employment continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace.
The government has pledged to create over 9 million urban jobs this year to prevent mass unemployment.
“Employment in the services sector remained worrisome,” added Wang."
597,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>","China's services sector bounces back into growth, job losses continue: Caixin PMI","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector returned to growth last month for the first time since January as the economy recovers from strict coronavirus-induced containment measures, although employment and overseas demand remained weak, a private survey showed.
The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, hitting the highest level since late 2010. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The return to expansion for China's services sector, an important generator of jobs which accounts for about 60% of the economy, was driven by a sharp rise in domestic new business though export orders fell for the fourth month in a row. 
Gauges for employment also continued to contract, although at a slower pace. 
""Employment in the services sector remained worrisome,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. 
Avoiding mass unemployment is a top government priority, with a target to create over 9 million urban jobs this year.
The economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction since quarterly records began, and analysts believe it will be months before broader activity returns to pre-crisis levels.
Highlighting the uncertain outlook, the government said in late May it was not setting an annual growth target, for the first time since 2002.
""Demand for services recovered more strongly than that for manufacturing, which was more constrained by sluggish exports amid the ongoing impact of the pandemic's spread outside China,"" said Wang. 
Caixin's manufacturing PMI also showed a return to growth in May but at a slower pace than the services sector, hampered by weak global demand.
Prices charged by service providers were cut for the sixth straight month in May, while input prices dipped slightly. 
The findings from the private sector survey, which focuses more on small, export-oriented companies, back an official survey on Sunday which showed momentum in the services and construction sectors quickening.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Wednesday, picked up to 54.5 in May from 47.6 in April. 
""In general, the improvement in supply and demand was still not able to fully offset the fallout from the pandemic, and more time is needed for the economy to get back to normal,"" said Wang. 
Beijing has boosted fiscal spending to bolster the economy, which some analysts say is equal to around 5% of China's gross domestic product (GDP). It has also stepped up monetary support, including lowering some of its key interest rates to reduce borrowing costs for companies.

The final seasonally adjusted au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 26.5 in May from a record low 21.5 in the previous month.
The index stayed in contraction for the fourth straight month, marking the longest such stretch since a five-month run to September 2012, though it was higher than a preliminary reading of 25.3 released last month.
""Services activity fell to a broadly similar extent to that seen in April as store closures continued and events were cancelled,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""Social distancing and reduced tourism ... are likely going to limit the speed and strength of any recovery as they continue over the short-to-medium term.""
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government is expected to submit a second extra budget to parliament early next week to fund a new $1.1 trillion stimulus to offset the hit from the pandemic, which has taken a grave toll on the services sector globally.
Schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stories reopened in Tokyo on Monday as restrictions put in place to control the outbreak were eased.
More than half of the surveyed companies reported lower activity levels compared with the previous month, while 6% saw a rise, the survey showed.
The employment indicator in the survey shrank at its fastest pace since July 2011, suggesting firms were reducing staffing levels in response to lower business requirements.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, also remained deep in contraction, although the index rose for the first time in four months, suggesting a slower pace of activity decline.
The index rose to 27.8 from April's final 25.8.

The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), in a post on its official WeChat account, said vehicle sales were estimated to rise to 2.14 million in May. It said the numbers were based on sales data it had collected from key companies, without giving further details.
CAAM expects January to May auto sales in China to fall 23.1% year on year to 7.9 million units.
As the global auto industry is hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, China has become a ray of hope for automakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (N:GM). 
In April, China's auto sales hit 2.07 million units, up 4.4% from a year earlier, the first monthly sales growth in almost two years, CAAM data showed.

It cautioned last month that even if China contains the outbreak effectively, its auto sales are expected to drop 15% this year, from over 25 million vehicles in 2019. If the pandemic continues, the annual sales contraction will likely be by up to 25%.

MADRID (Reuters) - The brutal job losses registered in Spain following the coronavirus outbreak reversed in May with the creation of net jobs for the first time since one of Europe's toughest lockdowns was imposed more than two months ago.
As the lockdown gradually eased in May, a net 97,462 new jobs were created during the month, although the overall number of jobs in the country was still 885,985 lower than in May 2019.
Data from the previous months had showed 900,000 jobs were lost in the second half of March alone. Spain registered 26,573 more people as jobless in May than in April, which represented a 0.69% increase. About 3.86 million people were out of work, data from the Labour Ministry showed on Tuesday.
Most of the new jobs were recorded in agriculture, construction and services that were partly able to resume activity in May. Industry's job creation remained stagnant.
Since the start of the lockdown in mid March, the regions that depend most on tourism, such as Andalusia, Valencia and the Canary Islands, have lost the most jobs, along with Madrid, the area that was ground zero of the outbreak.
The state provided unemployment benefits to 5,988,572 people, for a total amount of 5.12 billion euros. These include furloughed workers. 

About 18.46 million people had a formal job in the country in May.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia boasted a record current account surplus last quarter as firm export prices and a fall in imports provided a timely boost to growth, just as much of the domestic economy began to shut down to combat the coronavirus.
Other data out on Tuesday showed government spending also added to growth in the March quarter, while companies reported better sales and profits than many expected.
Those figures suggest the economy might not have shrunk in the quarter as previously feared. Gross domestic product (GDP) data, due on Wednesday, had been forecast to show output contracted 0.3%, the first fall since early 2011.
""A small positive print cannot be ruled out,"" said Su-Lin Ong, chief economist at RBC Capital Markets. 
""But the likely collapse in activity in the current quarter and accompanying impact on the labour market...is a sharp and deep shock through the whole economy with likely lasting ramifications.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is hopeful the slowdown would not be quite as dire as first feared given the country's success in containing the virus and massive injections of stimulus from it and the government.
The central bank holds its June policy meeting on Tuesday and is widely expected to keep rates at a record low of 0.25% while underlining a commitment to supporting the economy.
The conservative government of Scott Morrison has pledged over A$200 billion in spending, mainly on jobs support, and is currently flagging more dollars for the housing industry.
Tuesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed government spending rose strongly in the first quarter likely adding around 0.3 percentage points to GDP.
Firms also enjoyed a solid rise in sales in the quarter, in part due to panic buying of staples ahead of the lockdown in mid-March, which in turn led to a run down in inventories. 
Another bright spot was trade as the country's current account surplus swelled to a record A$8.4 billion ($5.70 billion) in the first quarter, handily topping forecasts of A$6.3 billion.
Solid demand from China and supply constraints helped keep prices high for key resource exports, particularly iron ore and gold, a trend that continued into April and May.
Export volumes were hampered a little by bad weather, but imports fell much further, adding another 0.5 percentage points to growth and again beating forecasts.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The balance of money circulating in Japan's economy reached $5 trillion in May, hitting a record high for the second straight month, as the central bank pumped more cash to cushion the blow to businesses and consumers from the coronavirus pandemic.
Armed with a raft of loan programmes aimed at prodding commercial banks to boost lending to cash-strapped firms, the Bank of Japan is expected to keep expanding its balance sheet to ease the fallout from the health crisis, analysts say.
""Japan's economy will probably be in crisis-mode at least for the rest of this year. It would be very hard for the BOJ to slow the pace of money printing,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
The balance of monetary base, or the amount of cash in circulation and deposits at the BOJ, stood at 543.4 trillion yen ($5 trillion) at the end of May, up 2.7% from the previous month, central bank data showed on Tuesday.
As part of monetary easing steps taken in April, the BOJ expanded a loan scheme created in March and pledged to pay financial institutions a 0.1% interest for borrowing money and lending it out to companies. The move led to a surge in the number of regional banks participating in the programme.
In May, the BOJ also unveiled its own version of the U.S. Federal Reserve's ""Main Street"" lending programme to channel nearly $280 billion to small businesses hit by the coronavirus and stop the economy sliding deeper into recession.
While the BOJ's aggressive monetary measures are considered essential to battle the crisis, it complicates its years-long efforts to shift its policy focus away from the pace of money printing towards interest rates.
After years of heavy asset buying failed to fire up inflation, the central bank shifted in 2016 to a policy targeting interest rates. Under yield curve control, it guides short-term rates at -0.1% and long-term bond yields around 0%.
Japan's government lifted nationwide state of emergency last week. But the economy is on the verge of a deep recession as the pandemic disrupted supply chains, hit global and domestic demand and forced many businesses to close.

Ireland partially eased stay-at-home restrictions two weeks ago that had been rolled out from mid-March and had shut all but non-essential operators like supermarkets and petrol stations in what had been Europe's fastest-growing economy.
With the unemployment rate, including those on temporary COVID-19 jobless payments, at a record 28.2%, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has suggested a speeding up of one of Europe's most conservative reopening plans could be announced this week. 
Government data suggests the unemployment rate has levelled off and the AIB IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) also showed factories may be over the worst of the sudden downturn, rising to 39.2 from 36.0 in April.
That was still far below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, and the eighth-worst reading on record. 
The output, new orders and exports sub-indexes rose from record lows but still recorded their second-lowest mark in the survey's 22-year history. The future output index rose back above 50.0, however, as marginally more firms predicted growth than contraction in a year's time.
The pace of the coronavirus-related slump also eased in neighbouring countries, with sister surveys for the euro zone as a whole rising to 39.4 and Britain to 40.6.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted a trade surplus of $4.5 billion in May, official data showed on Monday, as exports fell more steeply than imports, dragging the accumulated surplus over the first five months of the year further down from 2019.
May's trade surplus, which was slightly below the $4.74 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, was down 11.1% from the same month last year and the lowest May surplus registered in five years.
Exports totaled $17.9 billion in the month and imports were $13.4 billion, down 4.2% and 1.6% respectively, the Economy Ministry said. The total flow of cross-border commerce in May was down 3% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
Trade has been a drag on Brazilian economic growth in recent years, and the accumulated figures for the January-May period suggest this continues to be the case.
The trade surplus in the first five months, $16.3 billion, was 17.9% smaller than the same period last year, the Economy Ministry said, with imports falling 0.6% to $68.9 billion but exports falling 4.5% to $85.3 billion.
The relative weakness of exports occurred despite a significant depreciation in the real's exchange rate. Brazil's currency hit a record low near 6.00 per dollar in May, marking a fall of as much as 30% from May last year.

The deficit between January and March was equivalent to $2.7 billion, below the $3.5 billion in the same period the year before, when it was equivalent to 4.5% of GDP.
The current account of the balance of payments is a broad measure of transactions between the country and the rest of the world. It encompasses trade, interest payments, dividends, remittances and services like tourism.
The decrease in the deficit is due to less outflow of profits and dividends of companies with foreign direct investment, as well as a 14% increase in remittances, the bank said in a report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity eased off an 11-year low in May, the strongest sign yet that the worst of the economic downturn was behind as businesses reopen, though the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis could take years because of high unemployment.
The promising signs of stabilization in manufacturing reported by the Institute for Supply Management on Monday are a welcome respite as the country braces for data on Friday expected to show the worst unemployment rate since World War Two. Rampant joblessness will lead to tepid demand and economic growth.
""Today's report on the manufacturing sector represents good news that hints the economy is turning the corner as the states reopened in May,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""It will not be a quick recovery for sure, but at least the worst is over."" 
The ISM said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 43.1 last month from 41.5 in April, which was the lowest level since April 2009. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. May marked the third straight monthly contraction.
Still, the first increase in the ISM index since January mirrored improvements in regional manufacturing surveys in May and suggested April was the nadir for economic activity. A survey on Monday from data firm IHS Markit also showed stabilization in manufacturing conditions in May.
The ISM also viewed May as the ""transition month,"" but cautioned that ""demand remains uncertain."" 
The improvement was not uniform. Disruptions to the supply chain and social distancing are limiting transportation equipment manufacturers' ability to restart production. Food, beverage and tobacco industries were overwhelmed, nothing that increased demand ""stressed our production capabilities.""
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index rose to a reading of 31.8 in May from 27.1 in April, which was the lowest since December 2008. Despite the slight improvement last month, new orders at current levels suggest business investment could continue to shrink. The COVID-19 crisis has undercut corporate profits, which declined in the first quarter at rates last seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Business investment has contracted for four straight quarters. 
Stocks on Wall Street were higher, though caution reigned amid country-wide protests over race relations and a flare-up in tensions between Washington and Beijing. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices slipped.
BOTTOM REACHED
The economy contracted at a 5% annualized rate in the first quarter, the worst performance since the 2007-09 recession. Gross domestic product is expected to decline at a rate as sharp as 40% in the second quarter, which would be the biggest contraction in output since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The ISM's measure of factory employment advanced to a reading of 32.1 in May after plunging to 27.5 in the prior month, which was the lowest since February 1949.
About 21.4 million jobs were lost in March and April. The Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that at least another 8 million were lost in May, with the unemployment rate rocketing to 19.7%, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would be the highest since the government started tracking the series in 1948, and up from 14.7% in April.
""Manufacturers are being squeezed by both a collapse in demand and disrupted supply chains,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""With profitability under immense pressure firms are increasingly looking to cut costs, which will limit the ability of the U.S. economy to rebound quickly."" 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending dropped 2.9% in April, the largest decrease since October 2018, after being unchanged in March.
Economists had forecast construction spending declining 6.5% in April. The construction sector has fared better than other segments of the economy as some large projects were likely put in place months before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In addition, many states regarded the industry as essential business, when restaurants and other social gathering venues were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
The industry is also being supported by near record low interest rates. In April, spending on private sector construction projects dropped 3.0%. Outlays on homebuilding tumbled 4.5%. Spending on nonresidential structures, which include manufacturing plant and mining exploration, shafts and wells, decreased 1.3%. Investment in public construction projects fell 2.5% in April.

""Construction spending can be a somewhat lagging indicator, as outlays each month in part reflect projects started in prior months,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending dropped 2.9% in April. Still, the decline was the largest since October 2018. Data for March was revised down to show construction outlays unchanged instead of increasing 0.9% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending declining 6.5% in April.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index  stood at 38.3 in May after 35.0 in April. The April figure was by far the lowest in the survey's nine-year history.
A figure above 50 signals expansion in the sector, while a reading below that threshold points to contraction.
While the May data underscored a broad-based rise in index readings, the figures nonetheless pointed to further reductions from April's already low base, said Eliot Kerr, economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.
The survey showed that in May output fell sharply, demand conditions softened, new orders tumbled in part due to a decline in exports and firms continued to lay off workers.
""That said, the rates of decline in key metrics such as output and new orders eased during May, suggesting that contractions are beginning to bottom out,"" said Kerr.
From June 1, Mexico's government has planned to start reopening the country from anti-coronavirus measures, but deaths and new infections continue to rise, dampening expectations for major changes.
In spite of hold-ups in reopening schools and non-essential businesses, Mexico has started to allow automakers, mining firms and builders to exit the lockdown.
""With the recent announcement that restrictive measures are to be gradually removed, the trend towards recovery should accelerate over the coming weeks,"" said Kerr.
Mexico's economy, the second largest in Latin America, slipped into a recession last year and some private analysts forecast it will contract by as much as 10% or more in 2020.

The PMI index is composed of five sub-indexes tracking changes in new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

The Institute for Supply Management said Monday that its gauge improved to 43.1 last month from an 11-year low of 41.5 in April. Readings below 50 indicate shrinking activity. The purchasing managers group’s gauges of production and factory employment edged up from multi-decade lows, while an index of orders rose after the largest single-month slump since 1951.
While the data indicate producers are beginning to claw their way back as states begin reopening battered economies, weak export markets, record unemployment and lean capital spending budgets pose significant challenges.
The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for the ISM factory index to rise to 43.8 in May.
The supply managers group’s index of new orders increased to 31.8 from an April reading of 27.1. The production measure rose to 33.2 from 27.5.
The ISM’s gauge of factory inventories rose to a one-year high of 50.4, indicating slightly more elevated stockpiles that may limit production.
Meanwhile, the index of supplier deliveries fell for the first time since October, a sign that bottlenecks and transportation delays are finally beginning to ease.

May's final IHS Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 40.7, little changed from a preliminary reading of 40.6 and far below the 50 level above which the index would signal growth.
The reading was up from 32.6 in April, suggesting the sector was not declining as fast as before.
The PMI's output component -- which IHS Markit has said previously gives a better picture of the decline -- rose to 35.0 from 16.3.
New working practices, doubts about how long coronavirus restrictions would last, weak demand and Brexit worries would slow the recovery, IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
""This will make the 'new normal' one of the toughest recovery environments many manufacturers will ever have to face,"" he added.
The rate of decline in employment in manufacturing was the second most severe on record after April's plunge.
Pockets of growth were mostly linked to healthcare and personal protection equipment, but some firms reported signs of new inflows of business as clients began to reopen and lockdowns around the world were relaxed.
Britain's dominant services sector has been hit even harder by the lockdown restrictions. A final version of the PMI for services firms in the country is due to be published on Wednesday.

Many countries in the bloc have slowly started to reopen parts of their economies even though cases of the virus -- which has infected more than 5.8 million people worldwide and killed over 360,000 -- are still being reported.
So after crashing to its lowest reading in the survey's nearly 22-year history in April, IHS Markit's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) recovered somewhat last month.
It rose to 39.4 in May from April's 33.4, still a long way from the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and just below an earlier flash reading of 39.5.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday, remained weak but did almost double to 35.6 from April's record low of 18.1.
""The manufacturing downturn looks to have bottomed-out in April, with production falling at a markedly slower rate in May,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The improvement in part merely reflects the comparison against a shockingly steep fall in April, but more encouragingly was also linked to companies restarting work as virus lockdowns were eased.""
But with citizens still encouraged to stay home and many businesses remaining shuttered, forward-looking indicators in the survey suggested the recovery would be slow, echoing the findings in a Reuters poll last month.
Headcount was slashed again, backlogs of work were completed at a near-record pace while stockpiles of finished goods were built up, and raw material purchases declined sharply.

With hopes the worst has passed, however, purchasing managers were less pessimistic last month. The future output index, which gauges optimism about the 12 months ahead, bounced closer to the breakeven point of 50, registering 44.6 compared to April's 36.6.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's biggest economy, rose to 36.6 from 34.5 in April. The flash reading was 36.8.
""Even though more factories have started to resume operations after the loosening of restrictions, weak underlying demand is still a limiting factor, as evidenced by the survey's measure of new orders rebounding far less than that of output in May,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""Manufacturing production was already down 7-8% from a peak in late 2017 even before the onset of the pandemic, and now that figure looks to be in the region of 25-30%.""
Output declined more slowly than in April, but with firms operating well below full capacity and pessimistic about future output, factory staff cuts accelerated to their fastest pace in 11 years, with the investment goods sector hit especially hard.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 40.6 from 31.5 in April. That was slightly better than a preliminary reading of 40.3 though it remained far below the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
The government put France under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe in mid-March and only began lifting some restrictions on May 11. Further easing is due on June 2. 
The PMI survey showed that new orders continued to fall in May, albeit not as much as in April, and that manufacturers eased off on reducing headcount.
""Firms are now presented with an environment of subdued demand, as clients remain hesitant to place orders amid uncertainty over the removal of restrictions and the potential for further outbreaks,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.

""Going forward, the new orders index will take on an important role in determining when demand is beginning to recover, and only when that happens can we expect a return to sustainable growth.""

The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rebounded to 45.4 from 31.1 in April, remaining well below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The data was considerably less weak than expected. The median forecast in a Reuters survey of nine analysts had pointed to 37.0.
April's reading was the lowest since IHS Markit launched its survey in 1997, reflecting the closure of all factories not deemed essential to the country's supply chain. Plants were allowed to reopen in May.
IHS Markit's sub-index for output at manufacturers jumped to 47.5 in May from a record low of 11.4 in April, indicating another fall in production but a much less steep one.

Restrictions on non-essential economic activity in Spain and around the globe had sparked record falls in production, new orders and exports in April.
The Spanish economy shrank by the widest margin on record in the first quarter. The International Monetary Fund has predicted a contraction of 8% in 2020 and Spain’s central bank has forecast a recession of up to 12.4%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese firms raised spending on plant and equipment in the first quarter, though a sharp drop in profits highlighted the economic pain inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Capital spending rose 4.3% in the first quarter year-on-year, lifted by demand for electrical machinery and big-ticket items, a preliminary survey by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) showed on Monday.
However, corporate recurring profits decreased sharply at their fastest pace in over a decade, according to the survey, backing recent data underlining the pandemic's sweeping impact.
The damage from the virus is likely to have worsened due to a wider hit to the domestic economy from March, said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""It's likely there will be a bigger drop in April-June,"" he said.
Japan's economy slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the last quarter, putting the nation on course for its deepest postwar slump.
The government last week lifted an April-imposed state of emergency and approved a second $1.1 trillion stimulus package to combat the blow from the pandemic, which has ravaged the global economy and upended supply chains.
Japan's factory activity shrank at the fastest pace in over a decade in May, a separate private sector survey showed on Monday. 
The finance ministry's data will be used to calculate revised gross domestic product figures due June 8. The initial estimate showed an annualised 3.4% economic contraction in January-March - analysts expect a less steeper contraction in revised GDP.
The latest MOF survey drew fewer respondents than usual, as the pandemic forced many businesses to close, the ministry said, adding it will be revising the data later by extending the May 10 deadline for respondents by two months.
Takumi expects capital spending to be downgraded as firms that delayed their responses likely included those most affected by the outbreak.
Capital expenditure gained a seasonally adjusted 6.7% quarter-on-quarter in January-March, the survey showed.
Manufacturers' business spending rose 0.6% from a year earlier, according to the survey, conducted among firms with capital ranging from 10 million yen ($92,876) to 1 billion yen or more. It followed a 9.0% drop in the previous quarter.
Corporate recurring profit tumbled 32.0% in the January-March quarter year-on-year, the biggest drop since July-September 2009, due to declining demand for cars and other transportation goods.
Sales fell for the third straight quarter, down 3.5 on-year and followed the fourth quarter's 6.4% decline.

Investing.com – China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) indicated that manufacturing activity continued its expansion in May, with the National Statistics Bureau announcing a figure of 50.6 on Sunday.
PMI figures above 50 indicate an expansion.
But May’s figure came in below April’s 50.8 level, as well as below the 51-level predicted by analysts in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Non-manufacturing PMI was 53.6, compared to the previous month’s reading of 53.2.
Meanwhile, figures from the private Caixin/Markit survey corroborated the expansion but indicated that the economy returned to expansion in May instead of April.
The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI was 50.7 for May, higher than the forecasted 49.6 as well as the previous month’s 49.4.
The Caixin/Markit survey features a bigger mix of small-and-medium enterprises compared to the state-owned enterprises and big businesses polled by the official PMI survey, corroborated the expansion
The data also indicated that the rate of expansion for output at its fastest since January 2011, with production recovering faster than demand as total new work fell in May. 
The world's second largest economy is still recovering from the economic impact of the COVID-19 virus. Rising tensions with the U.S. over issues ranging from national security laws for Hong Kong and Macau, COVID-19's origins and Taiwan are also impacting the recovery.
“May data signaled a further increase in output following February’s record decline, with firms widely mentioning the resumption of works due to an easing of COVID-19 related measures. Data indicated that the fall was largely driven by weaker external demand, as many nations faced strict measures to stop the spread of the pandemic including company closures, leading new export orders to contract at a historically sharp rate,” Caixin and IHS Markit said in a joint statement."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asia's factory pain deepened in May as the slump in global trade caused by the coronavirus pandemic worsened, with export powerhouses Japan and South Korea suffering the sharpest declines in business activity in more than a decade.
A series of manufacturing surveys released on Monday suggest any rebound in businesses will be some time off, even though China's factory activity unexpectedly returned to growth in May.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) hit 50.7 last month, marking the highest reading since January as easing of lockdowns allowed companies to get back to work and clear outstanding orders.
But with many of China's trading partners still restricted, its new export orders remained in contraction, the private business survey showed on Monday. China's official PMI survey on Sunday showed the recovery in the world's second-largest economy intact but fragile.
Japan's factory activity shrank at the fastest pace since 2009 in May, a separate private sector survey showed while South Korea also saw manufacturing slump at the sharpest pace in more than a decade.
Capital Economics said the region's manufacturing sector is in deep recession.
""Industry is likely to have seen an initial jump from the easing of lockdown restrictions. And things are likely to continue improving very gradually over the coming months as external demand recovers,"" Capital Economics wrote. ""But output is still likely to be well below normal levels for many months to come as domestic and global demand remain very depressed.""
Taiwan's manufacturing activity also fell in May. Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines saw PMIs rebound from April, though the indices all remained below the 50-mark threshold that separates contraction from expansion.
Official data on Monday showed South Korea extending its exports plunge for a third straight month.
Asia's economic woes are likely to be echoed in other parts of the world including Europe, where economies continue to suffer huge damage in factory and service sectors.
With many countries starting to ease lockdown restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the virus, which has infected over 5.5 million people globally, equity markets are rallying on hopes for a swift return to health and prosperity.
But the trough in global economic activity will be deeper and the rebound is likely to take longer than previously predicted as the pandemic spreads in waves.
The International Monetary Fund warned last month the global economy will take much longer than expected to recover fully from the virus shock, suggesting a downgrade to its current projection for a 3% contraction this year.
A U.S.-China spat over Hong Kong's status and Beijing's handling of the pandemic could sour business sentiment and add to already huge strains on the global economy.

The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 38.4 from 41.9 in April, its lowest since March 2009, and matching a preliminary reading last month.
""May survey data revealed that production volumes are falling at an even faster rate than in April,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""Anecdotal evidence from the survey showed that was the result of collapsing demand, which fell at the sharpest rate since the global financial crisis,"" he added.
The survey pointed to the quickest contraction in output, new orders and work backlog since early 2009, as government-imposed lockdowns globally halted economic activity and hurt consumer sentiment.
The pandemic has been particularly disruptive for trade-reliant nations such as Japan, which already slipped into recession in the first quarter.
The government last week lifted the state of emergency and approved a second $1.1 trillion stimulus package, bringing the total pledged to save the economy from the pandemic to about 40% of gross domestic product.
A silver lining in the gloomy data were employment conditions as the rate of job shedding eased from April, when the drop in staffing levels was the sharpest in more than a decade.
""While easing lockdown measures will be positive for the economic environment, it is clear that dislocations will remain,"" Hayes said.
""Until we see a sustained improvement in demand, manufacturing conditions are likely to remain fragile.""

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose to 50.7 last month, from April’s contractionary 49.4. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 49.6.
Though modest, May's reading was the highest since January, driven by a sharp increase in output as companies got back to work and cleared outstanding orders. Supply chains also steadied after massive disruptions early in the year.
But demand remained subdued. With many of China's trading partners deep in lockdowns of their own, new export orders remained firmly in contractionary territory, although the drop was not as sharp as in April. Consumers have also remained cautious amid job losses and fears or a fresh wave of infections.
Although much of China's economy has reopened and the outbreak appears to have been contained, many manufacturers are struggling with reduced or cancelled overseas orders as global demand falters. 
Factories also continued to cut payrolls, but the pace of job shedding eased. Avoiding mass unemployment is a top government priority, with a target to create over 9 million urban jobs this year. 
""Sluggish exports remained a big drag on demand as the virus continued spreading overseas,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
""Stabilizing the job market is a top priority on policymakers' agenda this year, as shown in last month's government work report. Boosting employment is not an easy task, as the employment subindex in the Caixin manufacturing PMI survey has remained in contractionary territory for five months in a row,"" Wang said.
An official survey on Sunday showed China's factory activity grew at a slower pace in May but momentum in the services and construction sectors quickened, pointing to an uneven recovery. 
The economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction since quarterly records began, and analysts believe it will be months before broader activity returns to pre-crisis levels .
Highlighting the uncertain outlook, the government said in late May it was not setting an annual growth target, for the first time since 2002. 
Beijing also announced additional fiscal measures to bolster the economy, equal to about 4.1% of China’s gross domestic product (GDP), according to Reuters calculations.
China has cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves and repeatedly lowered some of its key interest rates to reduce borrowing costs for companies, while allowing smaller firms to postpone loan repayments.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports tumbled in May for the third straight month, though at a slower pace, as extended global lockdown measures to contain the wider spread of the coronavirus weighed on worldwide demand.
Shipments contracted 23.7% year-on-year in May, trade ministry data showed on Monday, slower than a 25.1% drop in April but worse than a 22.1% plunge tipped in a Reuters survey.
The average exports per working day, excluding the calendar effect, fell 18.4%, compared with a 18.3% fall seen in the previous month.
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be reported among major exporting economies, provides an early guide to the health of global trade.
""Exports will remain sluggish until the start of third quarter as global COVID-19 disruption and weak sentiment are expected to persist for sometime,"" said Chang Jae-chul, an economist at KB Securities.
""The U.S.-China tension over Hong Kong could also take a heavy toll on exports ... If the United States impose tariffs on Hong Kong just like on China, there would be further impact on global demand and that could pose a huge downside risk globally,"" he added.
Monday's data showed overseas sales of semiconductors, the nation's top export item, rose 7.1% from a year earlier, but per-day exports of that jumped 14.5% on-year.
Meanwhile, imports plunged 21.1%, far worse than a 15.8% drop in April and a prediction of 17.9% fall. That resulted in a $0.44 billion trade surplus, after April's $1.39 billion deficit, which was the first trade gap since January 2012.
South Korean government has pledged stimulus totalling about 245 trillion won to tackle the economic slowdown. It will unveil its third supplementary budget proposal in early June.

Overseas shipments fell 24% from a year earlier, the trade ministry said Monday, compared with economists’ forecast of a 25% contraction. Chip exports, South Korea’s biggest source of trade income, rose 7.1%.
The second double-digit decline of the year underscores the pandemic’s growing toll on South Korean exports, which serve as a barometer of global trade. While major trade partners like the U.S. and Europe have started to lift lockdowns, the process is hampered by resurgent infections and caution among consumers and businesses.

The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) edged down to 41.3 in May, the lowest since January 2009 and below 41.6 in April.
The headline reading stood below the 50-mark threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a fifth month.
Gauges for total new orders and export orders edged up slightly but remained in a deep slump as extended lockdowns to contain the virus doused demand.
A Reuters poll predicted a 22.1% plunge in May exports. Preliminary trade data will be released on June 1.
Factory production fell at the second-fastest pace on record.
""Output and new orders continued to sink at rates not seen since the global financial crisis ... The export component of the survey also showed another unprecedented monthly decline in overseas demand,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
Employment shrank for a 13th straight month and at its fastest pace on record amid restructurings, voluntary resignations and retirements.
Businesses remained pessimistic as firms worried about a global recession and slow recovery.
""The speed at which the global economy, and in turn, global trade, can recover will be a key determinant to the strength of South Korea's recovery,"" Hayes said.
""At this stage, however, it seems unlikely that conditions will allow for a robust pick-up in demand any time soon.""
On Thursday, the central bank cut interest rates to a record low and downgraded its 2020 economic projection to a 0.2% decline, which would be the biggest contraction since 1998.
The government is preparing for a third supplementary budget.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity grew at a slower pace in May but momentum in the services and construction sectors quickened, pointing to an uneven recovery in the world's second-largest economy as businesses emerge from coronavirus-led shutdowns.
Manufacturing slowed for a second month although activity has revived from record lows in February, when the government imposed tough travel restrictions, quarantine rules and factory suspensions to curb the spread of the respiratory illness. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) eased to 50.6 in May from 50.8 in April, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Sunday, but held above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts had expected a PMI reading of 51. 
Export orders logged the fifth consecutive month of contraction, with a sub-index standing at 35.3 in May, well below the 50-point mark, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to take a toll on global demand. 
""Judging by the PMI sub-indices, the absolute levels of demand-related indices are way below the production-related ones, indicating a pronounced constraining impact from demand on production,"" said Zhang Liqun, an analyst with the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing (CFLP), adding that more than 50% of companies have reported a lack of demand. 
Factories reduced headcount for the first time since they reopened, with a sub-index falling to 49.4 from 50.2 in April, the survey showed. 
In May, the PMI index for medium-sized and small enterprises fell to 48.8 and 50.8, respectively, while large companies reported a faster expansion in activity. 
In an encouraging sign, the forward-looking total new orders gauge showed an improvement to 50.9 from April's 50.2, suggesting domestic demand could be picking up soon. 
""In the near term, we expect monetary policy to continue the 'volume' of credit expansion in order to stabilise growth and help fiscal expansion. In this regard, China's domestic demand will likely continue to rebound,"" analysts with investment bank CICC said in a note after the data release. 
Hammered by the health crisis, China's economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction since quarterly records began. Analysts believe it will be months before broader activity returns to pre-crisis levels, even if a fresh wave of infections can be avoided.
While most businesses have reopened, many manufacturers are struggling with reduced or cancelled overseas orders as lockdowns push the global economy into recession. Domestic demand also remains depressed amid increased job losses and worries about a second wave of infections.
Zhao Qinghe, an official with the NBS, said more than 80% of factories have resumed production to 80% of levels prior to the coronavirus outbreak. However, indexes for imports and exports were at record lows as global demand continues to shrink. 
Highlighting the uncertain outlook, the government's work report earlier this month did not set an annual growth goal, the first time China has not set a target since 2002. 
But Beijing announced additional fiscal measures to bolster its economy, equal to about 4.1% of GDP, according to Reuters calculations, its largest stimulus package since the global financial crisis.
Higher spending, particularly on infrastructure, is expected to give activity a solid boost in the second half of the year and into 2021. A sub-index for construction activity rose to 60.8 in May from 59.7 the previous month, a separate survey on non-manufacturing activity showed, pointing to an accelerating pick-up in a sector that Beijing is counting on to boost growth.
New orders for the construction sector rose to 58, compared with 53.2 the previous month, while companies also added headcount at a faster clip. 
The official non-manufacturing PMI rose to 53.6 in May, from 53.2 in April, suggesting the sector's business and consumer confidence may slowly be improving.

The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.6 in May, from 53.2 in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The 50-point mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
China's services sector, which includes many smaller, private companies, has not recovered from the health crisis as quickly as manufacturing, with heavy job losses, pay cuts and fears of a second wave of infections making consumers cautious about spending again.
The official May composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, remained flat at 53.4 from April.

Rightmove said its site had more than 6 million visits for the first time on May 27, up an annual 18%.
""The challenge agents are facing is handling this surge in enquiries, having a process to deliver virtual viewings, and setting up socially distanced and safe physical viewings,"" Rightmove's commercial director, Miles Shipside, said.
The pace of a sharp fall in agreed sales had eased off but it would take ""considerable time"" for them to return to levels of early 2020, Shipside said.
Rightmove said areas which drew the most interest included places on or close to England's south coast and in its northern towns and cities, suggesting people were planning to work more from home, rather than commute to offices, after the lockdown.

The decision was backed by five of seven board members, the board said in a statement. The two dissenting members backed a cut of 25%.
""We are responding to the drop in inflation and its estimates, to falling growth, to rising unemployment, to what the country is experiencing in this terrible pandemic,"" board chief Juan Jose Echavarria said during a virtual press conference, adding there is debate about how far cuts should go.
The board has cut the rate for three consecutive months, after holding it steady for nearly two years.
The voting tallied with predictions by analysts in a Reuters survey, a majority of whom expected a cut of 50 basis points, while a minority predicted cuts of other amounts.
Colombia started a national quarantine in late March. While restrictions on many sectors have begun to relax, the quarantine is set to continue until July 1.
The Andean country's economy will contract by 5.5% this year, the finance ministry predicts.
Unemployment numbers spiked in April. The urban jobless rate was up to 23.5%, from 11.1% in the same month of 2019, while the national rate was 19.8%, nearly double the 10.3% recorded a year earlier.
Economic growth - which was 1.1% year-on-year in the first quarter - will likely be worse in the second quarter, Echavarria said.
""We expect this second quarter will be the worst of all and that conditions will begin to improve little by little as time passes,"" Echavarria said.

Analysts expect the bank to continue lowering the rate for the rest of the year. Echavarria did not rule out the possibility of negative rates, but said he did not favor them.

633,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>","Chile jobless rate hits 9% during pandemic, highest in decade","By Dave Sherwood
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's unemployment rate  hit 9% between February and April, the government said on Friday, holding its highest level in a decade as lockdown measures battered the South American nation's ailing economy.
The trade, fishing and manufacturing industries saw the sharpest drops in employment, the national statistics institute INE said in a statement. The self-employed in all sectors were particularly hard hit, the agency said.
Chile´s unemployment rate had already hit a decade-long high in the first quarter, lifted by months of protests over inequality in late 2019 that paralyzed the country.
Increasingly strict lockdown measures through May in the capital Santiago, the country´s economic engine, are likely to leave many more out of work, the agency said, warning that Friday´s jobless figures still ""do not reflect all of the effects of COVID.""
The agency also highlighted a sharp spike in workers who still have contracts with an employer but can collect unemployment insurance under an emergency law while their businesses are closed.
The fate of those workers, called the ""absent employed,"" will determine how much damage the coronavirus wreaks on Chile´s labor market, Credicorp (NYSE:BAP) Capital said in an analyst note.
""The key question is how many of these jobs effectively will be permanently lost as a result of the crisis,"" the consultancy said.
Chile, once among Latin America´s most stable economies, has reported more than 90,000 coronavirus cases and 900 deaths.
The South American nation has already announced an historic stimulus package of $17 billion, worth more than 5% of gross domestic product, to ease the economic impact of the pandemic.
Measures include beefed-up unemployment checks, deferred tax payments and government-backed credit lines for small business.

634,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>",Coronavirus sinks U.S. consumer spending; savings hit record high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumers cut spending by the most on record for the second straight month in April while boosting savings to an all-time high, and the growing frugality reinforced expectations the economy could take years to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed an economy highly reliant on the government, with financial aid checks from a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion driving a record surge in personal income.
Together with news that monthly exports collapsed, the report left economists anticipating the largest contraction in gross domestic product in the second quarter since the Great Depression. Data has also been dismal this month on the labor market, manufacturing production and homebuilding.
""Right now, the economy is totally dependent upon the largesse of the government,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Will the federal government keep sending out checks or will the household and business welfare payments dry up?""  
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, plunged 13.6% last month, the biggest drop since the government started tracking the series in 1959. It eclipsed the previous all-time decrease of 6.9% in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would plummet 12.6% in April. Spending was depressed by a decrease in outlays on healthcare as dental offices closed and hospitals postponed elective surgeries and non-emergency visits to focus on patients suffering from COVID-19.
The disease has killed over 100,000 people in the United States, the highest death toll in the world. 
Spending declined at restaurants, which have shifted to delivery and pick-up service only, and hotels and motels. Spending on food and beverages fell in April.
WELFARE ECONOMY 
But the COVID-19 crisis boosted incomes for consumers in April, with the government transferring an additional $3 trillion to households. It doled out one-time $1,200 checks to millions of people and boosted unemployment benefits for the roughly 31 million out of work to cushion against economic hardship wrought by the pandemic.
Personal income surged a record 10.5% last month. Without the government money, income would have declined 6.3% with business closures pushing wages down 8.0%. The unprecedented economic upheaval saw the saving rate hitting a record 33%. 
""If the economy reopens quickly without consequence, the millions who lost jobs are hired back and have no reason to fear they will lose their jobs again, these savings represent considerable spending power in the second half,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN in New York. 
""If it takes longer to reopen the economy, these savings will be used for sustenance over the next few months. They will limit the decline, but not fuel a sharp rebound."" 
The economy is gradually reopening after nonessential businesses were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19, raising hope the economic slump was bottoming. A survey on Friday showed consumer sentiment stable in May. 
Stocks on Wall Street fell as investors braced for a U.S. response to China's national security law on Hong Kong. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
In a second report on Friday, the Commerce Department said goods exports tumbled 25.2% to $95.4 billion in April, a 10-year low. The broad decline in exports was led by a 65.9% collapse in shipments of motor vehicles and parts. That outpaced a 14.3% tumble in imports. As a result, the goods trade deficit widened 7.2% to 69.7 billion last month.
The larger goods trade deficit is likely a drag on second GDP, which economists expect could drop at as much as a 40% rate, a pace not seen since the 1930s. 
The economy contracted at a 5.0% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest pace of decline in GDP since the 2007-09 recession. Consumer spending tumbled at a 6.8% rate, the sharpest drop since the second quarter of 1980. 
With consumer spending depressed in April, inflation pressures were weak. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components fell 0.4%. That was the largest drop since September 2001 and followed an unchanged reading in March. 
In the 12 months through April, the so-called core PCE price index rose 1.0%, the smallest gain since December 2010 which followed a 1.7% increase in March. The core PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure. The U.S. central bank has a 2% inflation target. 

""The core PCE decline reflects some big collapses in the prices of a limited number of the most-affected services,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""It is not evidence of a widespread Japanese-style deflation ensnaring America.""

The Commerce Department said on Friday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, plunged 13.6% last month. That was the biggest drop since the government started tracking the series in 1959, and eclipsed the previous all-time decrease of 6.9% in March.

Spending last month was depressed by a drop in outlays on healthcare as dental offices closed and hospitals postponed elective surgeries and non-emergency visits to focus on patients suffering from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. 
There were also decreases in spending at restaurants, which have shifted to delivery and pick-up service only, and hotels and motels. Spending on food and beverages fell in April.
The report added to dismal data on the labor market, manufacturing and the housing market in underscoring the horrific impact of the coronavirus crisis on the economy, with analysts warning it could take years for activity to fully recover from the devastating blow.
The economy contracted at a 5.0% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest pace of decline in gross domestic product since the fourth quarter of 2008. Consumer spending tumbled at a 6.8% rate, the sharpest drop since the second quarter of 1980. Economists expect GDP could collapse at as much as a 40% rate in the second quarter, a pace not seen since the 1930s.
But the economic slump could be close to bottoming as businesses reopen after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
Inflation was weak in April, with the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components falling 0.4%. That was the weakest reading since September 2001 and followed an unchanged reading in March. 
In the 12 months through April, the so-called core PCE price index rose 1.0%. That was the smallest gain since December 2010 and followed a 1.7% increase in March.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy grew at its slowest pace in at least eight years in the January-March quarter as the coronavirus pandemic weakened already sluggish consumer demand and investments.
Asia's third largest economy grew at a faster-than-expected 3.1% in the last quarter, compared with 5.7% a year ago, government data showed on Friday. 
A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a growth rate of 2.1% for the March quarter, compared with a downwardly revised 4.1% rise in the October-December period in 2019.
Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank, said GDP growth for the March quarter was likely to be downwardly revised as data collection was affected by India's coronavirus lockdown.
""The recovery process is likely to be a slow grind and we expect the catch-up process to pre-COVID-19 levels to take longer than earlier expected,"" Gupta said. 
India's manufacturing sector output contracted 1.4% in the March quarter from a year earlier, against a 0.8% fall in the previous quarter. Farm output grew 5.9% compared to 3.6% in the previous quarter, the data showed. 
On Friday, the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation cut its growth estimate for the fiscal year that ended on March 31 to 4.2% - the lowest in at least eight years under the current series - from a previously projected 5%. 
The government has maintained the lockdown ordered in late March though many restrictions were eased for manufacturing, transport and other services from May 18.
The lockdown's full impact on manufacturing and services will become more apparent in the June quarter. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) has predicted a 45% contraction from a year ago.
Economists expect the fiscal year that began in April will see the worst economic contraction in four decades, and say the economy could contract up to 5%. 

India has reported 165,000 coronavirus cases, with 4,706 deaths.

Statscan said gross domestic product in March fell by 7.2% from February, the most severe month-on-month plunge ever, while annualized growth for the first quarter sank by 8.2% - the greatest since the depths of the great recession.
""The March and April decreases are likely to be the largest consecutive monthly declines on record,"" Statscan said in a commentary.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a decline of 10% in the quarterly data and a 9% drop in the monthly figure.
Household spending in the first quarter dropped by 2.3%, the steepest fall on record.
""Spending reductions were influenced by substantial job losses, income uncertainty, and limited opportunities to spend because of the mandatory closure of non-essential retail stores, restaurants and services, and restrictions on travel and tourism activities,"" Statscan said.

Goods exports plummeted 25.2% in April from the prior month, the biggest decline in records back to 1989, to $95.4 billion, according to Commerce Department data released Friday. Imports decreased 14.3%, also the largest yet, to $165 billion. Combined, the value of U.S. exports and imports dropped to $260.4 billion, the lowest since April 2010.
The goods-trade deficit widened to $69.7 billion from a revised $65 billion a month earlier. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a $65 billion gap.
The advance indicators report also showed retail inventories declined 3.6% from March. Wholesale stockpiles rose 0.4%.

639,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",Japan's low unemployment rate conceals deeper labour market pain,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's labour market in April appeared to be weathering a severe slowdown in economic activity due to the coronavirus pandemic, but a closer look at official data released on Friday revealed a less rosy picture.
Japan's jobless rate rose to 2.6% in April from 2.5% in the previous month, a far cry from the 14.7% in the United States in April, a post-World War Two record, and the 7.7% in the euro zone in March. But economists say the small rise in the official unemployment rate masks the full extent of the pain. 
Analysts fear rises in the jobless rate could put the brakes on personal consumption in Japan and delay a recovery of the world's third-largest economy, which already slipped into recession in the first quarter.
Among those categorised as employed, those on furlough more than tripled to 4.2 million in April from the previous month. Although many furloughed workers will eventually go back to their jobs, their inclusion in April's unemployment figures would indicate a rate of 11.4%, Dai-ichi Life Research Institute said.
Friday's data also showed the number of workers fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.07 million in April from the previous month, the largest drop since a 1.13 million decline in January 1963, a Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications official said.
That compared with an increase of just 60,000 in the number of unemployed people, which only includes those who were actively seeking employment during the survey period, among other criteria.
Japanese firms, saddled with large workforces and excess capacity, laid off workers during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and the collapse of the global high-tech bubble in the early 2000s.
Now many are facing pressure to reduce labour costs by cutting jobs as they struggle with a decline in economic activity, especially in the service sector and at small and mid-sized firms.
The workers in Japan facing the brunt of those cuts are often workers without job security - part-timers, contract workers and temporary workers, who account for 36.2% of the total number of workers. The number of non-regular workers posted the biggest year-on-year drop on record in April, the data showed.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government this week approved a second $1.1 trillion stimulus package partly to keep the labour market together and prevent further rise in the unemployment figure. 

""The April jobless rate reached 2.6%,"" Finance Minister Taro Aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting on Friday. ""There's no doubt the impact of the coronavirus is playing out in economic activity. I think the numbers will deteriorate further in May.""

The euro zone's second biggest-economy contracted 5.3% in the first three months of the year from the previous quarter, INSEE said, revising its initial estimate of a 5.8% fall.
Nonetheless, it was France's deepest quarterly slump since 1968, when France was gripped by civil unrest, mass student protests and general strikes.
After the economy shrank 0.1% in the fourth quarter, France entered a technical recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction.
The government put France under one of the most strict lockdowns in Europe from mid-March, shutting down vast swaths of the economy until restrictions began to be lifted on May 11.
Although economic activity is gradually coming back on line, INSEE estimated earlier this week that the economy may contract 20% in the second quarter.

The lockdown depressed household spending, traditionally the motor of French growth. INSEE said on Friday that consumer spending had plunged a record 20.2% in April from March, when it had already slumped 16.9%.

Retail sales dropped by 5.3% on the month in real terms after an upwardly revised drop of 4.0% in the previous month, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. The reading was much better than a Reuters forecast of analysts for a 12% fall.
On the year, retail sales dropped by 6.5% in real terms after an upwardly revised contraction of 1.2% in March. A drop of 14.3% had been forecast.
Retail sales are a volatile indicator often subject to revision.
The figures are another indication that Europe's largest economy is weathering the pandemic better than its neighbours and that consumption could rebound in the coming months as economic and social life returns to normal.
Separate data from the Federal Statistics Office showed negotiated wages rose by 3.2% on average in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019.

642,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 02:21AM ET</span>","Japan's factory, retail sectors slump as pandemic hits auto sector","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output slid faster-than-expected and retail sales tumbled the most in more than two decades in April, as the coronavirus pandemic wrecked both foreign and domestic demand for the country's autos and other manufactured goods.
The bad numbers suggest the recession seen in the world's third-largest economy over the six months to March is likely to deepen in the current quarter as government-imposed lockdowns disrupted supply chains and kept consumers shut in at home.
Official data on Friday showed factory output slipped 9.1% in April from the previous month, the biggest drop since comparable data became available in 2013 as automakers and iron and steel manufacturers suffered sharp declines.
That was a much larger decline than the 5.1% drop in a Reuters forecast.
""Output will probably pick up from June onwards but it will be necessary to remain on guard for a second wave (of coronavirus infections),"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The pace of a rebound will likely continue to be sluggish.""
Automaker production fell by a third from the previous month. That led the government to downgrade its description of overall production to ""decreasing rapidly"" for the first time since November 2008, from just ""decreasing"" previously.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. (T:7201) plans to slash production capacity and model range by about a fifth to help cut costs by 300 billion yen ($2.79 billion), following a slide in sales, the automaker said on Thursday.
Separate data showed retail sales tumbled at their fastest pace since March 1998 as the nationwide state of emergency led service-sector businesses such as restaurants to close.
Retail sales plunged 13.7% in April from a year earlier, heavily weighed by slumping demand for general merchandise, clothing and vehicles.
The gloomy data comes after Japan's economy fell into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the first quarter.
The government this week lifted the state of emergency and approved a second $1.1 trillion stimulus package, bringing the total pledged to save the economy from the pandemic to $2.2 trillion.
JOBLESS RATE EDGES UP
Japan was already trying to shake off weak demand before the outbreak after the government raised the nationwide sales tax to repair its public debt burden.
The largest component of the government's new stimulus package was a loans programme for smaller firms in immediate need of cash to keep the lights on.
Other government data on Friday showed worsening conditions in the jobs market, suggesting such support for small- and mid-sized firms remained much-needed to prevent further losses.
The April jobless rate rose to 2.6%, its highest since 2017, although well-off the rates in other developed nations, where unemployment is approaching depression-era levels.
However, economists say the official unemployment rate masks the full extent of the pain. Among those categorised as employed, those in furlough more than tripled to 4.2 million in April from March.
While many furloughed staff will eventually return to work, their inclusion in April's unemployment figures would suggest a rate of 11.4%, Dai-ichi Life Research Institute said.
The number of non-regular workers posted the biggest year-on-year drop on record. Job availability slipped to 1.32, its lowest since March 2016.
Analysts said jobs pain is mostly concentrated in the service sector as opposed to automakers, which were hit badly during the 2009 global financial crisis.
""If demand around cars doesn't recover, there's a possibility employment conditions in the manufacturing sector will worsen more going forward,"" Minami said.

The factory output data showed manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to fall another 4.1% in May, followed by a 3.9% rise in June.

Industrial production fell 9.1% from March, dropping for a third month led by falls in auto and steel output, the trade ministry reported Friday. Economists forecast a 5.7% drop. Retail sales fell 9.6% from a month earlier amid shutdowns that kept shoppers home. The projection was for a 6.9% decline.
Unemployment rose less than expected. Analysts said resilience so far in Japan’s jobless rate masks an exodus of people from the labor force and continuing declines in factory production could start to trigger more manufacturing layoffs in the months ahead.

Industrial output contracted by a seasonally adjusted 6.0% in April from a month earlier, nearly double the 3.2% fall tipped in a Reuters survey and the biggest drop since a 10.5% plunge in December 2008.
Output had risen unexpectedly by 4.7% in March, benefiting from lengthy shutdowns in competing Chinese factories, which boosted demand for Korean-made display panels and cars.

648,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>","U.S. weekly jobless claims drop, but economic recovery still elusive","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits fell for an eighth straight week last week, likely as some people returned to work, but claims remained at astonishingly high levels, suggesting it could take the economy a while to rebound as businesses reopen.
The Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed a decline in the number of people receiving unemployment checks in mid-May. The data, however, excludes gig workers and others collecting benefits under a federal government program.
These workers do not qualify for the regular state unemployment insurance. The various programs, different reporting periods and protocols at state unemployment offices make it hard to get a clear pulse on the labor market. 
Economists said the government's Paycheck Protection Program, part of a historic fiscal package worth nearly $3 trillion, which offered businesses loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries, was also creating confusion. 
""We are entering the confusion stage for the employment and unemployment numbers,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Reopening of the economy is taking people from government payrolls to private sector payrolls, which is good. But the PPP is creating problems with understanding what exactly is happening.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 323,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.123 million for the week ended May 23, the Labor Department said. Claims have declined steadily since hitting a record 6.867 million in late March, but have not registered below 2 million since mid-March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast initial claims falling to 2.1 million in the latest week. Layoffs persist in the insurance, educational services, public administration, transportation and warehousing, agriculture, construction, manufacturing and retail trade industries. 
The astonishingly high level of claims, nearly three months after the shuttering of non-essential businesses to control the spread of COVID-19, points to a long recovery for the economy.
That was underscored by other data from the Commerce Department on Thursday showing business spending on equipment plummeting in April and the economy contracting at a much steeper 5.0% annualized rate in the first quarter instead of the previously estimated 4.8% pace.
Data in hand, including on the housing market, manufacturing and consumer spending has left economists expecting gross domestic product could drop in the second quarter at as much as a 40% rate, the worst since the Great Depression. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, but simmering tensions between the United States and China kept investors on edge. The dollar eased against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices dipped.
LONG-TERM DAMAGE
A record 40.767 million people filed claims since March 21. 
""We think these filings in the 10 weeks since the mid-March coronavirus pandemic lockdown tells the true story of the wreckage out there in the country and the enormous long-term damage done to the economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The number of people still receiving unemployment benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 3.860 million to 21.052 million in the week ending May 16. The so-called continuing claims number is reported with a week lag. 
Economists cautioned against reading too much into the sharp decline, noting that some states required residents to file for benefits on a bi-weekly basis, which they said was injecting volatility into the data. The drop in continuing claims was concentrated in Florida, California, Washington State and Ohio. 
""We doubt this is due to hiring and may reflect more the fact the continuing claims numbers are state benefits and don't include the people claiming the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program is the federal government initiative that pays unemployment checks to gig workers and many others for coronavirus-related job and income losses.
These workers do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance and are not included in both the weekly jobless claims and continuing claims figures. There were 1.193 million claims submitted last week under the PUA program, on top of the 7.793 million applications processed in the week ending May 9.
Including gig workers and other claimants, a staggering 31 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in early May. 
The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for May's unemployment rate. 

Continuing claims increased roughly by 3 million between the April and May survey periods, suggesting a rise in the jobless rate from a post-World War Two record of 14.7% last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the photos from beach and lake resorts made clear, many Americans dropped their guard over a temperate Memorial Day weekend, set aside coronavirus fears, and surged outside their homes, data from cellphone location companies showed in one of the strongest signs yet of the economic reopening taking hold in the country.
Data from Unacast estimated visits to some beach towns in southern states, including Alabama and Texas, roughly doubled from May 22-25 over the holiday weekend in 2019. The return of crowds to summer activities, captured in photos from places like Osage Beach in Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks region that led to a quarantine advisory, will be closely watched for its impact on the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Traffic to resorts in the northeastern United States increased over the week before, but remained roughly half that of the Memorial Day weekend a year ago, Unacast estimated, a finding in line with the tighter coronavirus restrictions still in place from New York City to Washington, D.C.
(GRAPHIC: Summer's here - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xegpbymlzvq/eikon.png)
Nationally, high frequency data showed a continued steady increase in activity.
Unacast showed national traffic to retail sites over the past week crept within about 25% of 2019, with a broader set of industries seeing higher activity. Data from Safegraph, indexed to March 1, rose nearly 10 percentage points, to 83, in the week beginning May 17 compared to the week before.
Data on a sample of small businesses released by time management company Homebase showed a small uptick in the number of places open and the number of employees working.
Broader indexes of the recovery showed little change. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' readings on consumer and industrial activity and a New York Federal Reserve Weekly Economic Index were all largely flat.
Another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment benefits in the week ended May 23, a decline of 323,000 from the prior week, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 5.8% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for March was revised sharply down to show these so-called core capital goods orders falling 1.1% instead of dipping 0.1% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders diving 10.0% in April. Core capital goods orders dropped 1.3% on a year-on-year basis in April.
Shipments of core capital goods dropped 5.4% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Core capital goods shipments fell 1.2% in March.
Last month's drop in core capital goods orders and shipments suggested business investment decreased further early in the second quarter after four straight quarterly declines. It came on the heels of record drops in retail sales and production at the nation's industries in April after drastic measures to slow the spread of COVID-19.
Economists are estimating gross domestic product plunged at as much as a 40% annualized rate in the second quarter, which would the largest slump in output since the government started tracking quarterly GDP in 1947. 
The economy contracted at a 5.0% pace in the first quarter, the sharpest since the 2007-09 Great Recession.
But the bottom in core capital goods orders is likely near, with regional Federal Reserve factory surveys falling in May, but at lesser steeper rates as the economy reopens.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, plunged 17.2% in April after dropping 16.6% in March. 
Demand for transportation equipment collapsed 47.3%. Boeing (N:BA) reported no orders in April, according to information posted on its website, and has experienced cancellations. 

Orders for motor vehicles and parts dived 52.8% last month.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's unemployment rate rose to its highest level in just over a year due to the coronavirus crisis, official figures showed on Thursday, as a record number of people left the workforce, pushing labor force participation to an all-time low.
Although the 12.6% unemployment rate was lower than economists had expected, other indicators such as the number of people leaving the workforce and the underemployment rate point to a weaker labor market than the headline figure suggests.
The 12.6% headline jobless rate in Latin America's largest economy in the three months to April was the highest since early last year, but notably lower than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 13.3%.
This comes a day after separate figures showed that Brazil lost a record 860,503 formal jobs in April, the biggest monthly fall in employment since comparable records began nearly 30 years ago.
Thursday's figures from government statistics agency IBGE showed that 89.2 million people were in work, down almost 5 million or 5.2% from the preceding three-month period, both record declines.
That pushed the labor force participation rate down to a record low 51.6%, with a record 70.9 million people now out of the workforce.
""Of the 4.9 million fewer people in work, 3.7 million were informal workers. There was also a record fall in the number of formal private sector workers ... which now stands at 32.2 million,"" said IBGE research analyst Adriana Beringuy.
The number of Brazilians officially out of work stands at 12.8 million, and the number of underemployed rose 8.7% to a record 28.7 million, IBGE said. The underemployment rate jumped to 25.6%, also a record. 

The labor market is likely to deteriorate further. Central bank president Roberto Campos Neto said he expects the unemployment rate to rise above 15%, while economists at Citi reckon it will near 18%.

The number of people registered as seeking work jumped by 843,000 from March to 4,575,500, the highest since records began in 1996, the Labour Ministry said.
The ministry said that the surge was due to a nearly 35% drop in the number of people getting new jobs while the number of people of joining the tally fell 19%.
The data do not include people who have been put on state-subsided furloughs during the crisis, which the ministry said on Wednesday numbered nearly 13 million.

France's government put the country under one of the most strict lockdowns in Europe in mid March and the country is only gradually emerging after most restrictions were lifted on May 11.

Britain's government is gradually relaxing its restrictions on much of the economy. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that shops which he ordered to close in March can reopen next month.
About one in five businesses in Britain went into hibernation because of the lockdown and the Office for National Statistics survey found that 14% of them expected to resume business in the next two weeks.
A further 10% were eyeing a reopening in two to four weeks' time and 31% expected to restart in more than four weeks' time.
Forty-six percent said they were unsure when they would resume trading.
Sandwich and coffee shop chain Pret A Manger said on Thursday it would reopen a further 204 shops across Britain for takeaway and delivery on June 1.
But department store chain John Lewis said on Wednesday it might not reopen all its 50 stores.
The ONS survey showed another sign of how the shutdown in Britain is slowly easing.
It found 73% of people had remained at home or only left for work, exercise, essential shopping or medical needs between May 21 and May 24, down from 81% a week earlier.

People in England - but not in other parts of the United Kingdom - are now allowed to drive to the countryside or the beach, something banned under the first stage of the lockdown.

The Recruitment & Employment Confederation's Business confidence measure remained negative but rose to -10 from -21 in April. Short-term demand for permanent staff improved to -5 from -9.
""Coronavirus has caused a huge slowdown in the labour market, but this data indicates that the worst could be behind us,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
Demand for workers in May was strongest in the health and care sector but was likely to rise more broadly, REC said.
Separately, the Institute of Directors said a quarter of its member firms using the government's wage subsidy programme would struggle to contribute to the salaries of furloughed workers from August, raising the prospect of job losses.
""Business leaders know that the government's support can't be infinite but the ugly truth is that if there's no money coming in the door many firms will be forced to make difficult decisions,"" IoD Director General Jonathan Geldart said.
The IoD's survey of 697 company directors showed around half of those using the scheme for their staff could provide 20% or more toward furloughed workers' full-time salaries between August and October when the programme is due to end.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak will announce in the coming days how much companies will have to contribute to the scheme which has so far cost the public purse about 15 billion pounds.
A third survey, published by the Confederation of British Industry and covering the March-May period, showed companies in the services sector were more pessimistic about growth over the next three months than they have ever been.

Firms expected to cut back on investment in the year ahead at the fastest pace since the financial crisis, although to a lesser degree for information technology, the survey showed.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts, sales and prices are expected to start to recover by mid-2021 as the coronavirus pandemic recedes, but the precise timing and duration of that rebound is highly uncertain, Canada's national housing agency said on Wednesday.
Until then, the same measures -- housing starts, sales and prices -- are expected to plunge, according to a special edition of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's (CMHC) Housing Market Outlook report.
Housing starts will likely see a decline of 51% to 75% in 2020 from pre-COVID-19 levels, before starting to recover by the second half of 2021, CMHC said. 
Existing home sales are also expected to slump this year, falling 19% to 29%, with recovery expected to start late in 2020. Average home prices are forecast to drop by 9% to 18% in 2020, with recovery anticipated to begin in the first half of 2021.
Sales and prices are likely to remain below their pre-COVID-19 levels through 2022, the agency added.
""Canada's housing markets could start to rebound by the end of the first half of 2021, once the unprecedented medical emergency abates sufficiently to allow containment measures to be relaxed and consumer and business confidence to recover,"" the report reads.
""The precise timing and speed of the recovery is highly uncertain because the virus' future path is not yet known,"" CMHC Chief Economist Bob Dugan told reporters.

Officials shuttered most non-essential businesses across Canada in mid-March and urged people to stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus. This reduced residential construction in certain regions, but in recent weeks provinces have started to reopen slowly.

The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index increased 8.6% from a week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the index rose 7.4% from the prior week and was 9% higher compared to the same week a year ago. It was the sixth consecutive weekly gain and a 54% surge since early April.
""The home purchase market continued its path to recovery as various states reopen, leading to more buyers resuming their home search,"" said Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. ""The purchase loan amount has increased steadily in recent weeks and is now at its highest level since mid-March.""
The sustained gains in mortgage applications suggest a jump in first-time buyers of both new and previously owned homes in April was probably not a fluke. Homebuilder sentiment also improved in May. 
The housing market has a giant footprint on the economy, which contracted at its deepest pace in the first quarter since the Great Recession and lost at least 21.4 million jobs in March and April as states and local governments took drastic measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus. Rising demand for home loans offers hope the economic slump is close to bottoming as businesses reopen.

""While there could remain downward pressures on housing demand overall this year from still-high unemployment, we would not be surprised to see a potential overshoot of pre-COVID level of housing demand if temporarily postponed activity resumes in the coming months,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

Earnings fell 4.3% year-on-year to 478.1 billion yuan ($67 billion) last month, after plunging 34.9% in March, the statistics bureau said on Wednesday. 
China's economy has shown patchy signs of recovery as it reopens after several weeks of tough virus containment measures.
But fallout from the pandemic, which paralysed business activity and triggered the first quarterly economic contraction on record, is expected to crunch earnings for many more months as demand at home and abroad remains weak.
For the first four months, industrial firms' profits fell 27.4% year-on-year to 1.26 trillion yuan, compared with a 36.7% slump in the first three months. 
Automobiles, special-purpose equipment, electrical machinery and electronics industries notched up significant recoveries in profits in April. Twenty three out of 41 sectors surveyed posted growth last month versus eight in March. 
However, the overall profit outlook is still not optimistic as demand has still not recovered, industrial goods prices remain low, and pressure from costs are still high, Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau, said in a statement.
Recent data from factory activity to trade have underscored a weak outlook for China and the global economy.
Beijing has stepped up tax and credit relief for virus-ravaged companies since February, but it has refrained from massive economic stimulus for fear of rekindling debt risks.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 46.0% year-on-year for the first four months, slightly faster than a 45.5% decline in the quarter ending March, the data showed. 
Downward pressure on prices continues to hurt profits, particularly in the commodity and heavy industry sectors dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), said Louis Kuijs, of Oxford Economics.
""Given our subdued outlook for commodity prices, we expect the profitability of SOEs and heavy industry to continue to struggle in the coming months,"" he said.
Private sector profits declined sharply although at a slower pace of 17.2% in January-April, from January-March's 29.5% fall.

""The continued contraction in industrial profits could weigh on manufacturing investment, employment and fiscal revenues, and we expect Beijing to step up policy stimulus measures to cope with the COVID-19 shock,"" said Nomura analysts in a note.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence nudged up in May, suggesting the worst of the novel coronavirus-driven economic slump was likely in the past as the country starts to reopen, but it could take a while for the economy to dig out of its hole amid record unemployment.
Signs the downturn could be close to bottoming were bolstered by other data on Tuesday showing the pace of decline in manufacturing activity in Texas and services industry contraction in the mid-Atlantic region easing this month.

Businesses across the country are opening doors after shuttering in mid-March as states and local governments took drastic measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, almost grounding the country to a halt. The economy contracted at its deepest pace in the first quarter since the Great Recession and lost at least 21.4 million jobs in March and April. 
Recessions in the United States are called by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, the NBER looks for a drop in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months. Economists believe the economy slipped into recession in March.
Stocks on Wall Street rallied, also spurred by optimism about a potential COVID-19 vaccine. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
The Conference Board survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, fell to a reading of 71.1 this month from 73.0 in April. This gauge has declined by nearly 100 points in the last couple of months, underscoring the impact of COVID-19.
But the expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions climbed to 96.9 from a reading of 94.3 in April.
SOME IMPROVEMENT
Despite the improvement in expectations, households remained worried about their finances. They also anticipated higher inflation, which could lead to perceptions of reduced purchasing power and hurt the much-needed consumer spending.
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, improved to a reading of -10.4 in May from -15.7 in April. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. 
The percentage of consumers expecting an increase in income dropped to 14.0% this month from 17.2% April and the proportion anticipating a drop fell to 15.0% from 18.4%.
The improvement in the data tone was echoed by a survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve on Tuesday showing Texas factory activity falling again in May, but at a slower pace compared to April's record plunge. Similarly, services industries in the mid-Atlantic region reported a continued decrease in activity, but a pulling away from a historic slump in April.
Separately, the Commerce Department said new home sales increased 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 623,000 units last month. Still, the gain left the bulk of March's 13.7% plunge intact. Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10% of housing market sales, diving 21.9% to a pace of 480,000 units in April. 
While the sales gain was at odds with data last week showing home resales logging their biggest drop in nearly 10 years in April, and homebuilding and permits suffering record collapses, it added to rising mortgage applications and homebuilder confidence in offering a hopeful sign for the housing market. 
""This is perhaps another sign that demand for housing has remained strong despite the record spike in unemployment and social distancing restrictions which have limited house shopping this spring,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Last month, new home sales rose in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but dropped in the West. About 47% of new home sold were priced below $200,000. As a result, the median new house price in April decreased 8.6% from a year ago to $309,900. 
A fifth report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index increased 3.9% from a year ago in March after rising 3.5% in February. 

Separately, the Chicago Fed reported a historic plunge in its measure of economic activity in April.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil experienced its most aggressive deflation for at least 26 years in May, according to a mid-month measure of consumer prices released on Tuesday, as the coronavirus crisis triggered a collapse in transport and related prices.
The monthly rate of Brazil's IPCA-15 consumer price inflation in the month to mid-May slumped to -0.59% from a revised -0.01% a month earlier, the lowest rate for any month since the ""Real Plan"" was launched in 1994 to end the country's history of hyperinflation.
That was also a bigger fall than the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists of a 0.45% decline, and helped reduce the annual rate of inflation to 1.96%, also below forecasts of 2.10%.
The annual rate is now significantly below the central bank's official 2020 consumer price inflation target of 4.0%, signaling it can follow through on its steer that it will cut interest rates again at its next meeting in June.
The accumulated rate of inflation so far this year is 0.35%, IBGE said.
Transport costs fell 3.5% in the month, IBGE said, providing a 0.63% impact on the overall month-on-month decline in prices. 
Within that, fuel costs slumped 8.5%, including a 10.4% fall in ethanol prices, while air fares plunged 27.1% in the month, according to IBGE.
Of the nine groups of goods and services surveyed, five registered outright deflation in May from the month before, IBGE said, including housing, food and drink, and household goods. 
Fabio Kanczuk, economic policy director at the central bank, said last week that the consensus among policymakers was that the coronavirus crisis would be extremely deflationary. 

The economy is expected to register its steepest annual downturn this year since records began in 1900. The latest consensus in the central bank's weekly FOCUS survey of economists is for a 5.9% contraction.

Eight out of 10 British retailers reported cash flow difficulties, down modestly after a nightmarish April, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said.
Its monthly gauge of retail sales rose to -50 from in May, still a historically weak reading but up from a joint record low of -55 in April, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists.
""The retail sector is at the sharp end of a crisis, with many businesses up against it,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
Retailers might need more support from the government if demand falters as outlets reopen in the coming weeks, she said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that Britain will reopen thousands of high street shops, department stores and shopping centres next month.
Retail sales fell by the most on record in April, according to official data last week, as much of the sector was shuttered by the government's coronavirus lockdown.
Supply chain disruptions worsened over the past month, the CBI survey showed, with a majority of retailers reporting shortages of some goods and increased cost pressures.
More than half of the companies surveyed said they had laid off staff temporarily while 8% had made permanent redundancies.
""The government's support packages are making a real difference, with more shops reporting that jobs have been furloughed, rather than lost,"" Newton-Smith said.

Investment intentions across retail, wholesale and distribution companies collapsed to a record low over the last few months, the survey showed.

The GfK consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of some 2,000 Germans, remained in negative territory, but rose to -18.9 points from an upwardly revised -23.1 in the previous month.
The reading undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a somewhat bigger rebound to -18.3.
The gradual reopening of many businesses across the country helped to lift the propensity to buy, GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said. But he added that uncertainty remained high as consumers anticipated a severe recession.
""Anxiety over job losses remains high and has proven to be a key barrier to consumption at this time, alongside losses in income,"" Buerkl said. ""Retailers and manufacturers must continue to adapt to this situation.""
The improved consumer climate went hand in hand with a drop in propensity to save. Income expectations rose slightly but remained well below their level from a year ago as unemployment and reduced working hours led to income losses.

""For a number of freelancers, for example from the culture sector, there is still no end in sight for the lockdown. This means their income remains at zero,"" Buerkl said.

668,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>",Mexico posts largest trade deficit on record as exports collapse,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Monday posted its sharpest trade deficit on record in seasonally-adjusted terms as demand for its products abroad fell faster than imports, in a gloomy sign for Latin America's second largest economy struggling with the pandemic's fallout.
In April, Mexico posted a $4.293 billion trade deficit when adjusted for seasonal swings, the INEGI national statistics agency said on Monday. That compares to a trade surplus of $1.873 billion in March and surplus of $1.510 billion in April 2019.
The deficit posted in April was by far the largest on record, according to data dating back to 1991, as exports dropped 37.7% in seasonally-adjusted terms and imports fell 21.9%.
""Going forward we expect to see weak exports and imports driven by the sharp contraction of both global and domestic demand, lower commodity prices, and some supply chain disruptions due to extensive lockdown protocols,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos.
Mexico's economic growth is seen crumpling, with JP Morgan projecting a steep 40% decline in the second quarter versus the prior quarter and 8.4% contraction overall for 2020.
INEGI data earlier this month showed Mexican auto production and exports collapsed, as the pandemic forced shut car manufacturing plants and sapped consumer demand for new vehicles. Production plunged 98.8% in April from a year earlier, while exports fell 90.2%.
In non-seasonally adjusted terms, Mexico posted a trade deficit of $3.087 billion. It was the biggest deficit in non-seasonally adjusted terms since January 2019.
Separately, the Bank of Mexico, the nation's central bank, reported a first quarter current account deficit $982 million, equivalent to 0.4% of gross domestic product, helped by rising migrants remittances and export income before global lockdowns began to bite.

That compares to a current account deficit of $11.1 billion, equal to 3.6% of GDP in the first quarter 2019.

669,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",German business morale rebounds; state spending key to recovery,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy is starting to recover as curbs to slow the coronavirus are lifted, a business morale survey showed on Monday, and separate output data pointed to the importance of government spending to support the recovery.
Business morale in Europe's largest economy rebounded in May, the Ifo economic institute said, recovering from its worst decline on record in April as a reopening of the economy boosted expectations among companies.
""The German economy is again seeing light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe. ""But we are still far away from optimism.""
Separate data from the Federal Statistics office gave an indication of the damage caused by restrictions to stop the spread of the virus, which pushed the economy into its steepest contraction since 2009 in the first quarter.
A slump in capital investments, private consumption and exports contributed to the 2.2% slump. Ifo said it expects a double-digit dip in the second quarter when the full impact of the restrictions introduced in mid-March become more visible.
Healthy construction and higher state spending were the only bright spots in the otherwise grim data; together, they prevented a deeper contraction. Government spending rose by 0.2% on the quarter and construction grew by 4.1%, the data showed.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, which has approved an unprecedented 750 billion-euro rescue package, is due next week to propose additional stimulus to sustain the recovery, which economists say will be slow and partly dependent on how fast Germany's euro zone trading partners return to normal.
""While (social and economic) activity slowed down to 60% of its January level during the peak of the lockdown, it has now returned to more than 80%,"" Carsten Brzeski, ING's chief economist for the euro zone, wrote in a note to clients.
""However, to offset the economic damage of the last two months, much more acceleration is needed. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise that the German government is currently preparing another fiscal stimulus package,"" he added.
'CORONA VALLEY'
Merkel's government asked parliament in March to suspend a constitutionally enshrined debt brake to finance the rescue package, which included an unlimited credit scheme to small, medium-sized and large companies.
In a reversal of her opposition to big cash handouts within the European Union, Merkel this month also joined forces with France to allow the bloc's executive arm to borrow 500 billion euros on behalf of its 27 member states and transfer it to the regions and industries hit hardest.
The German stimulus package is expected to include relief for municipalities struggling with lower taxes and support for families, as well as more funds for companies with fewer than 250 employees.
Germany has withstood the crisis better than most of its neighbours, suffering relatively fewer deaths from the virus. Its economy has also weathered the pandemic better, partly because it let factories and construction sites remain open.
But the full scale of the damage caused by the crisis will become apparent in the second quarter.
Ifo said a sub-index in its survey gauging current conditions fell in May, reflecting expectations among company executives that restrictions and disruptions to supply chains will continue to hamper activity.
Fritzi Kohler-Geib of KfW bank said the speed of the recovery hinges on the government's stimulus package.
""Germany is on the right path. The path out of the Corona Valley is long,"" she said. ""To complete it successfully, new confidence in the future is the key. In order to strengthen and consolidate the coming recovery, it is therefore essential to quickly draw up a growth and investment programme.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Migrant workers Zhang Jianpeng and his wife returned to Beijing in late April, after nearly three months in lockdown at their home village in northern Shanxi province waiting for China's COVID-19 epidemic to subside.
By the time they got back to the city, the restaurant where they had both worked had long since closed, and neither has been able to find a new job.
They have used up their savings of 30,000 yuan ($4,202) and Zhang is now in debt, using one credit card to pay off another.
""One month was fine. But after the second month, into the third, there was no money left,"" the burly 28-year-old told Reuters. 
He has two young daughters being looked after by their grandparents back in the village, in an economically depressed old coal mining area. 
There are no jobs there, and having spent the last of their savings while looking for work in the capital, going back penniless would be a bitter pill to swallow.
""How could I face my parents?"" Zhang asked.
In China, there are an estimated 280 million rural migrant workers, like Zhang. They have been, perhaps, the hardest-hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus, and many are excluded from unemployment insurance.
In the first quarter, China's economy contracted for the first time in decades. Due to uncertainties cast by the global pandemic, China's communist leaders decided against setting a growth target this year. [nL4N2D40KJ] 
Surveyed unemployment in the nation of 1.4 billion was 6% in April, but many analysts say true unemployment must be far higher. [nL4N2BV0WT]
Zhang and his wife rent a cheap apartment a three-hour bus ride from Beijing proper, where he spends every day wandering through old haunts looking for a job.
""Work is hard to find this year. Too hard,"" said Zhang. ""And if you find it the wages are too low."" 
He reckoned restaurant wages have slumped by a third, and if he were lucky enough to find a job he would likely be paid only around 4,000 yuan ($560) per month.
PECKING ORDER
New policies call for migrant workers to be given equal access to employment services, and expanded subsistence allowances for those who return home. But many like Zhang have received little help so far.
Dealing with unemployment is a top priority for Beijing, but while the government emphasises support for migrant workers, some analysts say they get less attention because they are less likely to create political problems.
Bigger concerns are unemployed college graduates and laid-off urban workers, said Dan Wang, of the Economist Intelligence Unit. The latter are more likely to have mortgages to pay, and so could affect the real estate market, she said.
There has not been any obvious increase in worker protests yet, but judging by postings on social media ""discontent is growing,"" said Geoff Crothall, of China Labour Bulletin. 
Premier Li Keqiang, in an annual report released on Friday, promised more help for small and medium-sized firms, which generate most of China's jobs. The government expects 9 million new urban jobs to be created this year - its lowest target since 2013. 
As life returns to normal, ""the economy will also start to flourish, and rural migrant workers' incomes will definitely continue to grow,"" Zhao Chenxin, vice secretary general of the National Development and Reform Commission, told a news briefing on Sunday.
But he said most new jobs would go to graduates and armed forces veterans, while a portion would go to migrant workers.
""The hard truth is that, from a policymaker perspective, unemployed rural migrants are much less of a concern or threat than unemployed urban people,"" said Louis Kuijs, of Oxford Economics.

The Federal Statistics Office said capital investments fell by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019. 
This meant that private consumption took off 1.7 percentage points of overall economic activity and net trade shaved off 0.8 percentage points, translating into a first-quarter contraction of 2.2%, the steepest rate since 2009.
The data showed that investments in the construction sector, which accounts for almost 10% of overall national output and is Germany's largest employer, rose by 4.1%, contributing 0.4 percentage points to quarterly growth.
State spending was the other bright spot in the otherwise grim data and together with construction it prevented a deeper contraction. Government expenditure rose by 0.2% on the quarter, the data showed.
The 2.2% drop in quarter-on-quarter output was the widest since the financial crisis of a decade ago and the second biggest since German reunification in 1990. It followed a 0.1% contraction in the last three month of 2019.
Economists expect a bigger fall in output in the second quarter as the bulk of curbs introduced in mid-March to fight the outbreak become more apparent.
""As the first quarter performance is the result of ‘only’ two weeks of lockdown and supply chain disruptions due to lockdown measures in Asia, it does not need much analytical skill to predict a much stronger slump in the second quarter,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief euro zone economist at ING.

""Three more weeks of lockdown and a very gradual lifting of some measures do not bode well for the second quarter.""

672,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 01:05AM ET</span>",China's pork imports in April jump 170% to record high,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China, the world's top pork consumer, imported a record 400,000 tonnes in April, up nearly 170% from a year earlier, customs data showed, as buyers took advantage of low prices to stock up on meat.
China imported 1.35 million tonnes of pork in the first four months of this year, surging 170.4% from the same period a year ago, after a plunge in domestic production kept prices much higher than other markets.
The deadly African swine fever disease has reduced China's pig herd by at least 40%, slashing pork output and sending prices of the country's favorite meat to record highs. 
China has been buying from overseas markets, including the United States, where pork prices are among the cheapest in the world, and initially fell as infections with COVID-19 began spreading in the country, hitting demand.
Graphic: China pork imports - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xklvygkzwvg/ChinaPorkImportsApril2020.png
Though Chinese pork prices have also fallen steadily since early February, they are still about double where they were a year ago, and were three to four times U.S. pork prices in March, before plant shutdowns caused the latter to spike in mid-April.
The jump in U.S. prices is likely to reduce imports in the coming month, while Chinese pork prices are still falling on weak domestic demand.
U.S. pork exports to China set a record for the period from January to March, according to data from the U.S. Agriculture Department.
China also brought in 160,000 tonnes of beef in April, up 28% from the previous year. Imports of the meat in the first four months of the year rose 54% to 680,000 tonnes, customs data showed.

673,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 10:11PM ET</span>",All 50 U.S. states shed jobs in April: Labor Department,"By Dan Burns
(Reuters) - Unemployment rates rose and total employment fell in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia in April as efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to close across the country, the Labor Department said on Friday.
The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said 43 states set record-high rates of unemployment last month, with the highest being in Nevada, the state with the greatest reliance on the hard-hit food services and hospitality industry. Nevada's jobless rate surged by 21.3 percentage points from March to 28.2%, which was nearly double the national rate of 14.7% in April.
The monthly breakdown of state-level nonfarm employment and jobless rates, published two weeks after the national payrolls report, painted a picture of widespread but nonetheless uneven devastation caused by the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness triggered by the novel coronavirus.
The May 8 payrolls report showed a record 20.5 million jobs were lost in April, the steepest plunge in U.S. employment since the Great Depression.
Friday's report indicated more than a quarter of those job losses were concentrated in three of the largest U.S. states: California, which shed 2.3 million jobs; New York, which has seen the largest number of U.S. COVID-19 cases and deaths and lost 1.8 million positions; and Texas, which has suffered a double blow from plunging oil prices and lost 1.3 million jobs.
In Nevada, home to the global gambling mecca of Las Vegas, half of the nearly 245,000 jobs lost in April were in the leisure and hospitality sector. That industry has suffered the greatest losses nationally from the reductions in travel and widespread closures of dine-in restaurants during a month when stay-at-home orders were deployed broadly.
The leisure and hospitality sector losses also took a major toll on Hawaii, which was one of only three states with an unemployment rate above 20% - Nevada and Michigan were the other two. The Pacific island state lost more than 55% of leisure and hospitality jobs last month, accounting for 57% of all jobs lost in that period.
In Michigan, more than one of every five jobs was eliminated, at least temporarily. The leisure and hospitality sector led the declines there, too, but a quarter of the state's losses came in the manufacturing and construction sectors.
INFECTION RATES
Layoffs have persisted in May even as all 50 states have reopened businesses to one degree or another. On Thursday, the BLS reported more than 2.4 million people filed for unemployment benefits for the first time last week and those continuing to receive jobless relief payments topped 25 million in the week ended May 9.
That data suggests the worst may not be over for the hardest-hit states such as Nevada, Hawaii and Michigan. The number of continued claims rose in all three, including a 31% week-over-week increase in Hawaii.
Economists believe that progress in driving down infection rates will be an important factor behind the success of state re-opening efforts. 

On that front, at least, both Hawaii and Nevada appear to be leaders, and they are among just eight states to have shown three straight weeks of declines in the 7-day average of new cases. Michigan is among 20 states that have seen declines in two of the past three weeks.

The largest deterioration in the labor market occurred in Michigan, Vermont and New York.
In Michigan, payrolls plummeted 22.8%, or a little more than 1 million, from the prior month to 3.4 million, according to Labor Department report Friday. Vermont, with a much smaller population, registered a 19.6% decline, while employment in New York slumped 18.8%.
Meanwhile, unemployment rates in 43 states were the highest in records back to 1976. The jobless rates in Nevada and Hawaii exceeded their previous records by more than 10 percentage points each. Unemployment in Nevada jumped 21.3 percentage points to 28.2%, while Hawaii’s climbed 19.9 points to 22.3%. Michigan posted the third-largest increase -- an 18.4 point rise to 22.7%.
The state data offer a more granular look at the 20.5 million job losses seen across the nation in April -- 10 times the previous record decline, according to the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report. The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7%, the highest in government records dating back to the 1940s.
While the job losses in Oklahoma, Arkansas and Wyoming and still numbered in the thousands, those states saw the slowest paces of deterioration in payrolls. Employment dropped by around 8% in those states from a month earlier. Meanwhile, jobless rates remained in single digits in just eight states, with Connecticut registering the lowest at 7.9%.
With all 50 states open this weekend, at least in part, future releases should offer a more nuanced view of recovery.

675,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 22, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>","In the Lockdown Economy, Old Measures of Inflation Get It Wrong","(Bloomberg) -- Inflation is one of the great question marks of the coronavirus era, with some economists predicting it’s poised to take off and others warning of a deflationary slump.
For the technicians of inflation, there’s a more immediate challenge: how to measure it properly. Right now, the cost of lockdown living is higher than headline gauges suggest.The broadest price measures are based on a “basket” of the goods and services that consumers typically spend their money on. And that basket has gotten cheaper during the pandemic. In the U.S., for example, the main price gauge posted its biggest month-to-month drop for more than a decade in April.
The problem, according to Alberto Cavallo -– an associate professor at the Harvard Business School who specializes in inflation –- is that “the basket for a typical consumer during lockdown is very different.”With swaths of the economy shut down, some goods and services, such as restaurant meals or hotel rooms, are barely available at all. Others are temporarily out of favor, like gasoline as car travel dropped. Some may be available at bargain-basement prices: plane tickets, say, at a time when few want to fly.In each case, people aren’t buying nearly as much of this stuff as they used to –- but when it comes to measuring the inflation rate, the items count for just as much as they did pre-virus. They still have the same weighting in the basket, in other words.When you measure the prices of the things Americans are in fact spending money on, “it turns out that the actual inflation rate is not as low,” says Cavallo, the co-founder of the Billion Prices Project, a global initiative to keep track of online prices. He has constructed a basket for the Covid-19 economy.
It shows that prices did fall last month -– but not as much as the headline numbers suggest. “The reason is that, on average, people are now consuming relatively more in categories that are experiencing higher inflation,” he says. Meat prices, for example, have jumped as the epidemic disrupted supply chains.These kinds of measurement issues aren’t academic: They can directly affect living standards and contribute to income inequality. Americans who rely on Social Security benefits get a cost-of-living adjustment to their payments every year, based off headline inflation measures.If consumers quickly return to their pre-virus habits as the economy reopens, the gap in inflation may prove to be a blip. But if some shifts are permanent, it could take years before official measures adjust.The Bureau of Labor Statistics reassesses its consumer-price basket each year based on a wealth of data. Thousands of Americans help out, by keeping diaries that list everything they buy.The catch is that this happens with a lag of at least two years. That’s not a big problem in normal circumstances, because consumer behavior tends to change fairly slowly. But some of this year’s shifts -– from eating out to eating at home, for example -- have been dramatic.
“We definitely need better real-time data, not just on prices, but on consumer-expenditure shares as well,” Cavallo says.The pandemic has raised other difficulties for the price watchdogs.For a start, the BLS had to stop sending its data collectors into stores -– where most transactions still occur, even under lockdown. As of March 19, it’s been relying on phone calls and emails instead.
That means “they’re getting a smaller subset,” said Randal Verbrugge, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Center for Inflation Research. “It can’t be good for accuracy.”
With the Department of Labor closed, employees are collecting data from home instead of in their offices. Usually processing errors are minimal. But the upheaval is putting statisticians under pressure like everyone else -– as glitches in jobs data this month have illustrated.It’s not unusual, of course, for some prices to jump around. Policy makers who rely on such data, including central bankers, often look at measures of so-called core inflation, which strip away volatile items such as food.
The Cleveland Fed has developed measures that go even further in removing outliers, in order to provide a better signal of the underlying inflation trend. One gauge looks at whatever is in the middle of the distribution of price changes. Another cuts out about 8% of items at either end.There are workarounds for other virus-era dilemmas, too. If some items just aren’t available to purchase, for example, the technicians in charge of producing inflation data can find others and use them as a substitute.It’s not ideal, according to Verbrugge at the Cleveland Fed, but “the procedures weren’t built with an epidemic in mind.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales plunged a record 10% in March as officials shuttered many non-essential businesses to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, Statistics Canada said on Friday, and it said April data could post an even sharper decline.
The drop, which Statscan called the largest on record, was led by a collapse in car sales and matched the 10% decline forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. In volume terms, sales plummeted a record 8.2%.
""Data for March show an ugly situation even before the economy was tamped down for a full month,"" said Royce Mendes, a senior economist with CIBC Capital Markets in a note. 
Sales excluding autos declined only 0.4% in March, which was better than the expected 5.0% drop analysts had predicted. 
Statscan revised February's gain up slightly to 0.4% from an initial 0.3% and, in a preliminary flash estimate, said retail sales in April could fall 15.6%.
About 40% of retailers closed their stores in March as officials urged people to stay at home, Statscan said, adding the pandemic forced many businesses to open or expand their e-commerce platforms in March. On a year-over-year basis, retail e-commerce jumped 40.4%. 
Auto and parts dealership sales dropped 35.6% on lower demand, while gasoline station sales fell 19.8%, the largest decline on record, on both lower demand and lower prices as the result of a global supply glut. 

Meanwhile, clothing stores (-51.3%), furniture and home furnishing (-24.5%) and sporting goods, hobby book and music stores (-23.8%) all reported the largest monthly declines on record.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's central bank will consider further monetary impulse measures including non-traditional avenues to bolster the economy as the world's no. 1 copper producer grapples with the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic, according to minutes of its latest policy meeting released on Friday.
The bank decided in May to keep the benchmark interest rate at a technical minimum of 0.5% - its lowest level since 2009 following a series of cuts over several months - while taking other measures to guarantee liquidity in the financial system.

The bank said it would consider taking further action to stimulate monetary impulse ""with special attention to its impact on the flow of credit to the economy,"" the minutes said, adding that it would study other, ""non-traditional"" measures to jump-start financial activity.

Data from the national statistics agency on Friday showed consumer prices rose in the year through early May by 2.83%, a level below the central bank's target rate. Still, a Reuters poll of analysts had forecast a reading of 2.46%.
A breakdown of the agency's data showed the cost of some foods, including tomatoes, as well as beer and some fuels, helped push up the cost of living in early May. In the second half of April, inflation stood at 2.21%.
The central bank targets an inflation rate of 3%, with a tolerance range of one percentage point above or below that.
Core inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy costs, stood at a rate of 3.76%, the data showed. That was slightly above the 3.64% rate forecast by the poll.
Mexico's economy is expected to suffer its biggest contraction in decades in 2020 due to the impact of the coronavirus, and the central bank last week cut its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%.
Nevertheless, Mexico's main interest rate is far higher than in leading western economies, and analysts expect borrowing costs to fall further in the months to come.

The latest data showed consumer prices rose 0.30% during the first half of May compared with the previous two-week period. A drop of 0.07% had been forecast. The core price index rose 0.24% over the period, beating expectations for an increase of 0.12%.

679,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>","UK debt soars to highest since 1963, retail sales slump","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - A measure of British public debt leapt to close to 100% of the country's economic output in April, its highest in nearly 60 years, and retail sales slumped by a record 18% as the coronavirus crisis hammered the economy.
Government borrowing of 62.1 billion pounds ($75.80 billion) in April alone was just a fraction lower than its total for the whole 2019/20 financial year. 
It was also far higher than a median forecast of 40 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
On top of that, March's borrowing was revised up sharply to almost 15 billion pounds as the government's emergency job-saving scheme began and tax revenues were revised down.
That took the stock of public debt to nearly 98% of gross domestic product, also reflecting a lower estimate of the size of the economy based on a recent coronavirus scenario by Britain's budget forecasters.
It was the highest share of GDP by that measure since 1963, the Office for National Statistics said.
In April last year, it had stood at 80% of GDP.
""The double whammy of the precipitous fall in economic activity and the government's measures to combat the crisis has already pushed borrowing to alarmingly high levels,"" Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said.
""While the small easing of the lockdown on 13th May probably meant the government did not have to borrow quite as much this month as in April, it's clear the government will still have to borrow a few hundred billion pounds this year.""
Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden told Reuters that an economic recovery later this year could be slower than in a central bank scenario published earlier this month, and he pointed to several risks of long-term damage.
BORROWING UP, BORROWING COSTS DOWN
""While there is significant pressure on the public finances, there are no signs that the government is struggling to find the cash,"" Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said.
British government borrowing costs over two and five years fell to new record lows as debt markets opened on Friday.
""It would therefore be wrong to reduce coronavirus support measures prematurely,"" McCurdy said.
Central government spending leapt by 54% to over 109 billion pounds while receipts fell about 26% to 45.6 billion pounds.
The ONS also said British retail sales fell by the most on record in April as much of the sector was shuttered by the government's coronavirus lockdown.
Sales volumes slumped 18.1% in April from March, a slightly bigger fall than forecast in the Reuters poll.
James Smith, an economist with ING, said there might not be a quick bounce-back for retailers when the lockdown is lifted.
""Recent surveying from YouGov showed that just under half of people would be uncomfortable with returning to a clothing shop, although the jury is out on whether the public will become more relaxed by the time retailers do reopen next month,"" he said.
The volume of clothing sales in April plummeted by 50.2% when compared with March 2020, which had already fallen by 34.9% on the previous month.
But the share of spending that was done online jumped to 31% of the total, a big increase from 22% in March.

Fuel sales tumbled by a record 52%, reflecting the impact of the government's lockdown order. But alcohol stores showed an increase in sales, up 2.3%.

Foreign and domestic demand for Japanese goods has collapsed amid virus lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, adding to views that the economy sank deeper into recession in the current quarter.
Industrial output was expected to fall 5.1% in April from the previous month, the biggest drop since comparable data became available in 2013, the poll of 15 analysts showed on Friday, following a 3.7% decline in March.
""The government issued the emergency status in April due the expansion of the coronavirus impact and overseas economic activity stagnated, which likely pushed down productions of durable goods and capital goods,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
Retail sales likely fell 11.5% in April from a year earlier, the fastest pace of decline since March 1998, after a revised 4.7 decline in March.
The government urged people to refrain from going out to prevent the virus' spread, and department stores and other shops scaled down or temporarily closed their businesses, which damaged retail sales, analysts said. 
The trade ministry will announce both factory output and retail sales at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Friday, May 29 (2350 GMT Thursday).
Japan's jobless rate was seen rising to 2.7% in April from 2.5% in March and the jobs-to-applicants ratio slipped to 1.33 from 1.39, according to the poll.
""Business conditions worsened significantly in areas such as accommodation, transportation, restaurant and entertainment. Labour demand has also receded,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Other data is expected to show that Tokyo's core consumer price (CPI) index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, likely fell 0.2% in May from a 0.1% slip in April, after oil prices fell and the coronavirus impact pushed down prices, especially in the service sector, analysts said.
The jobs data and the Tokyo core CPI will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Friday. 

The economy slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the last quarter, putting the nation on course for its deepest postwar slump.

681,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",What to Watch Friday as China Finally Unveils 2020 Economic Plan,"(Bloomberg) --
China’s top leaders should reveal Friday how much they’re planning to spend on stimulus to support the post-virus economy, when they belatedly announce their economic policy blueprint for the rest of 2020.
The centerpiece event will be the work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang, which typically contains the economic growth and spending targets, as well as the goals for jobs and inflation.
Growth  Target  (NYSE:TGT)
The most important number to watch is the target for gross domestic product growth, which is the anchor for policy making and affects spending and debt sales. With the nation facing the slowest growth in more than 40 years and uncertainty still high with the virus raging globally, the government may however not even announce a target this year. It’s possible that a description of the desired level of growth or a range is announced.
If the leadership does follow convention and publish a numerical target, the pace and the language describing the number should be closely watched. That will illustrate the balance Beijing is trying to strike between restoring growth and avoiding an unsustainable increase in debt. Economists mostly expect a target below 3% or no number at all.
Nomura Holding Inc. economists updated their view on the growth target, saying there’s a 50% probability that the government will not announce it. Previously they had said there was a small chance of this. There’s also a 50% chance the goal will be set at about 2%-3%, they wrote Thursday.
Unemployment
It was already clear that jobs would be top of the agenda this year, with Premier Li previously indicating that employment would be prioritized over economic growth.
A steady supply of new jobs is crucial for both social stability and government legitimacy and with only meager unemployment benefits, getting people into work is also key for supporting domestic spending. The plan is expected to detail targets for new job creation and the jobless rate for the year.
Millions of Newly Jobless in China Pose a Looming Threat to Xi
Last year the government aimed for more than 11 million new urban jobs and a jobless rate of around 5.5% last year, and claimed to have met those targets, despite the trade war. However, the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak threw uncounted millions out of work and caused the jobless rate to spike above 6% earlier this year.
The government is likely to focus on getting those people back into work and ensuring jobs for the millions of people who will join the workforce this year. Nevertheless, Macquarie Group (OTC:MQBKY) Ltd’s Larry Hu in Hong Kong expects the jobless rate to peak at around 10%, and the increase in urban jobs to be about half the level of last year.
Monetary Policy
The general “prudent, flexible and appropriate” stance of monetary policy isn’t likely to change, but investors should look for any shifts in the wording on monetary stimulus in the report, which should flesh out the People’s Bank of China’s promise earlier this month to use “more powerful” policies.
PBOC Vows Stronger Pro-Growth Policy But Leaves Details Vague
The government could target faster credit growth in 2020 than last year and may promise to keep it expanding slightly faster than nominal GDP growth. It will also likely drop the promise to “avoid excess liquidity flooding the economy.” That phrase was cut from the PBOC’s regular report earlier this month and its removal indicates there will be less control on the expansion of lending and debt.
In the past, the work report has set explicit goals for bank lending or forecast detailed monetary policy actions such as cutting banks’ required reserve ratios and interest rates. Any indication of a reduction in the benchmark deposit rate would also be an important signal of stimulus.
Fiscal Policy
Three numbers will set the tone of fiscal stimulus in 2020: the official budget deficit ratio, the amount of local government special bonds and the amount of sovereign special bonds. Combined, these determine the real size of China’s spending deficit.
Economists expect the government to drop the long-held deficit limit of 3% of GDP for the first time in at least a decade, but anything below 3.5% will disappoint expectations for a substantial increase in spending.

Special bonds sold by local governments will indicate how much more infrastructure spending there will be this year. The quota for those bonds is estimated to be between 3 to 4 trillion yuan ($420-$560 billion), up from 2.15 trillion yuan last year.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“China stands out among emerging markets as one of the few that’s able to finance significant deficit spending. Others, hamstrung by dependence on foreign borrowing, have limited space to act.”
Tom Orlik & Scott Johnson, economists

The central government could also sell as much as 2 trillion yuan in sovereign debt for anti-virus spending, but when considering the stimulus effect investors should look closely at not only the size but also the purpose of the debt. The economic effect will be much larger if the money is borrowed to pay for infrastructure projects rather than general spending.
Poverty Alleviation
The government’s long-term goal of ending absolute poverty will be center stage this week.
That’s partly because it was meant to be achieved this year, and also because the virus made the other target of doubling incomes by this year from 2010’s level less likely. In the months since the outbreak President Xi Jinping has repeatedly expressed his resolution to accomplish the poverty mission on time.
That involves billions of yuan in investment in relocating rural villagers, building homes, infrastructure and schools. The program involves spending by all levels of government as well as bank loans. There’s usually no overall number that includes all the spending, but any concrete amount in the work report is worth noting.

The government is due to set a target for urban job creation of over 9 million jobs, lower than the previous year’s target of around 11 million, and a target for the urban surveyed unemployment rate of around 6%, higher than 2019’s goal, according to the document.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for Topix index companies fell 26% in January-March, compared with the same quarter last year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That’s based on results from more than 80% of the benchmark gauge’s components, as many companies have delayed results amid the impact of the coronavirus.
The bottom line also collapsed for Japanese enterprises during the period as the nation’s economy sank into a recession. The 89% drop in earnings per share is among the worst in Asia, and much more severe than the 23% fall for S&P 500 companies, the data show. Social distancing has crimped consumer spending; companies have cut investments and exports have slid. Analysts forecast a 21.5% contraction in GDP in the June quarter, a record for official data going back to 1955.
The biggest contributors to Japan’s quarterly earnings and sales declines have been trading companies, metals & mining and auto component makers, according to CLSA Ltd.
Wednesday saw reports from the three major non-life insurers, which usually marks the end of the earnings season. Still, heavyweights including Recruit Holdings Co., Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. have yet to announce results. And a large number companies have declined to provide outlooks for future results, or withdrawn previously made predictions.
Valuations
“While signs are emerging of an end to the pandemic, expectations for earnings recovery remain muted, resulting in a rapid increase in P/E,” Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities Co. strategists including Tsutomu Saito wrote in a note Thursday. “Many remain cautious due to the ongoing downtrend in EPS and companies’ inability to disclose guidance.”
The Topix is trading at 14.5 times 12-month forward earnings estimates, the highest level since February 2018. That’s partially because estimates for earnings per share have fallen to 103 yen, the lowest since December 2016.
In terms of shareholder returns, share buybacks have been scarce after reaching record levels in Japan the past two years. Many companies have also cut dividends or declined to make projections on payouts for the current period.
Unprecedented
This has been “an earnings season like no other,” with “alarmingly delayed reporting” in addition to the earnings declines, CLSA strategist Nicholas Smith wrote in a May 16 report. Smith noted that late reporting -- with the last announcement not expected until August -- is complicating plans for annual general meetings, with some companies either pushing back the dates or opting to hold two separate meetings.
Automobile-related sectors have posted the biggest shortfalls in operating profit versus analyst expectations, while airlines have seen the worst drop in operating margins, he said. On the plus side Japanese companies continue to sit on a large cash pile, which Smith sees as “ammunition for an overseas M&A assault and for a resumption of buybacks once conditions stabilize.”
Still Unclear
“There is still uncertainty about corporate earnings forecasts and there’s a need for a bit more clarity,” said Yoshihiro Okumura, a general manager at Chibagin Asset Management. “It looks like it will take time, until July and August, when the results for the fiscal first quarter will be out.”
Okumura sees further gains in Japanese equity prices as challenging after the Topix recovered roughly half of its losses from the March selloff.

686,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",U.S. Jobless-Claims Data Become Much Trickier as Economic Gauge,"(Bloomberg) -- For decades, the U.S. jobless-claims report has provided a straightforward, routine read on the labor market every Thursday. Now it carries a variety of asterisks.
Two sizable reporting errors in as many weeks have inflated the U.S. Labor Department’s nationwide jobless-claims count and the number of applicants under a federal emergency program. On top of that, the report has been beset by data quirks stemming from filing schedules that vary from state to state, as well as seasonal adjustments that have been rendered less useful because of the explosion in layoffs during the coronavirus pandemic.
While it’s not uncommon for claims to be revised, nor will the latest complications alter the bleak and sudden deterioration in the labor market, the errors come at a time when economists and policy makers are attempting to get the best-possible handle on the pandemic’s damage to the economy and the pace of recovery.
“It’s clear you cannot overemphasize or overfocus on any one week of a data point for a particular state given the volatility that we have, given the backlogs that a lot of these states have had to work through,” said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB).
“As states begin to reopen, and as we’ve had this staggered reopening across different states, we will be looking at how that reopening is impacting the pace of improvement in claims,” Luzzetti said.
The latest report was marred by a data-entry error from the Massachusetts labor agency. An official from the state said in an email that it had 115,952 initial claims last week under the separate federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, not the 1,184,792 shown in the U.S. Labor Department’s report.
That means nationwide claims under that program -- which expands unemployment benefits to those not traditionally eligible, such the self-employed and gig workers -- were actually about half of the reported 2.23 million figure. The U.S. Labor Department said it will incorporate the correction into next week’s report.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Jobless claims should continue to trend down. The pace of declines has been stubbornly slow, but could accelerate given there are tentative signs of small employers rehiring as the economy reopens.”
-- Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva, Andrew Husby and Eliza Winger
Read more: Bloomberg Economics’s week-ahead preview
A week earlier, Connecticut corrected its count to show 29,846 new claims for the regular state program from a previously reported 298,680, explaining most of a 294,000 downward revision in the U.S. Labor Department’s adjusted figure for the week ended May 9.
Initial jobless claims for regular state programs totaled 2.44 million in the week ended May 16, Labor Department figures showed Thursday. Since efforts to the contain Covid-19 pandemic rapidly shut down the economy in mid-March, about 38.6 million initial unemployment insurance claims have been filed under state programs. That’s roughly equivalent to all of the initial claims filed during the Great Recession, from December 2007 through June 2009.
Differences in how frequently people claim continued benefits in states is yet another reason why it’s become more difficult to get a precise read on week-to-week changes in the labor market at the state level. Economists are monitoring the number of Americans already on benefit rolls to gauge the breadth of the recovery in the labor market as states begin to reopen their economies.
Continuing Claims
These data are lagged by a week, and in the period ended May 9, the majority of states reported an unadjusted decline, a sign that reopenings are putting people back to work in many parts of the country. Yet, total continuing claims jumped an adjusted 2.5 million to a record 25.1 million. The increase was due largely to big unadjusted spikes in California and Florida, and the California rise owes in part to a biweekly filing cycle for aid recipients.
The enormous influx of claims has overwhelmed state unemployment offices. Florida, which has received more than 2 million total claims since March 15, has more than 200,000 filings in its queue awaiting verification. Backlogs have led to delays for millions of Americans across the country in receiving payments, as states scramble to keep up with the unprecedented number of claims.
Read more: Millions in U.S. Are On Edge, Waiting for Jobless Benefits
Errors and differing state reporting methods aside, some economists are looking to the raw numbers for a more accurate read on applications amid challenges with the federal agency’s seasonal adjustment process. On an non-seasonally adjusted basis, initial claims eased to 2.17 million last week from 2.36 million. Continuing claims on that basis totaled 22.9 million for the week ended May 9, up from 20.9 million.
“Given what’s going on is not part of any typical seasonal pattern or anything, I think the NSA data has given you probably a little bit better of a more accurate picture of what’s going on in the data,” Luzzetti said.

(Bloomberg) -- The IHS Markit composite index of purchasing managers at manufacturers and service providers improved 9.4 points to 36.4, still the second-lowest in records back to 2009, the group reported Thursday. Readings below 50 indicate contraction, and the data are consistent with indexes for Europe, Japan and Australia that point to a worldwide recession.
IHS Markit composite measures of U.S. orders and employment advanced in May, while a gauge of export demand showed only modest improvement and indicated lingering weakness in the global economy.
“Encouragement comes from the survey indicating that the rate of economic collapse seems to have peaked in April,’’ Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. “In the absence of a second wave of Covid-19 infections, the decline should moderate further in coming months as measures taken to contain the coronavirus are steadily lifted.’’

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday existing home sales plunged 17.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.33 million units last month. The percentage decline was the largest since July 2010.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home would decrease 18.9% to a rate of 4.30 million units in April.
Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, dropped 17.2% on a year-on-year basis in April. 
The report came on the heels of data on Tuesday showing a record collapse in homebuilding and permits in April. 
It added to a plunge in retail sales and manufacturing production last month in strengthening economists' predictions for the biggest contraction in gross domestic product in the second quarter since the Great Depression. 
The worst of the housing market slump is likely behind as the country reopens after a near total shutdown since mid-March to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. 
With at least 21.4 million people losing their jobs in March and April, however, the housing market could remain subdued for a while even with mortgage rates near record lows.
Home sales last month declined in all four regions. 
There were 1.47 million previously owned homes on the market in April, the lowest on record for the month and down 19.7% from a year ago. The NAR said some sellers had either withdrawn or withheld their properties from the market following the stay-at-home orders.

The median existing house price jumped 7.4% from a year ago to a record $286,800 in April. At April's sales pace, it would take 4.1 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.2 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits totaled 2.43 million in the week ending May 16, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday, the smallest increase since March but still remaining at elevated levels.
It was broadly in-line with forecasts and was down from 2.68 million in the prior week. That figure was revised lower after Connecticut said it had misreported its numbers.
Claims have been gradually decreasing since hitting a record 6.86 million in the week ended March 28.
The latest filings bring the number of people who filed claims for unemployment benefits to around 38.6 million since March 21.
The data reinforced economists’ expectations for another month of historic job losses in May. Statewide lockdowns starting in mid-March to contain the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus have severely undermined the labor market and the wider economy.
The economy lost a staggering 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge in payrolls since the Great Depression.
Continuing claims, which show the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased to a new record of 25.07 million in the week ended May 9, the report said, up from 22.54 million a week earlier.
Continuing claims figures are reported with a one-week delay but are considered a better gauge of the labor market.
Continuing claims could offer some clues on how quickly businesses rehire workers as they reopen. They can also gauge companies' ability to get people off unemployment or keep workers on payrolls as they access the government's Paycheck Protection Program, which offered loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries.
""Most recently, continuing claims have plateaued and suggest that we could be seeing an early sign that employers are calling back employees as states begin to re-open,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Focus should continue to center on continuing claims, which provide a better idea of the challenges unemployed workers face and also some insight into the hit to GDP growth.""

The CBI said its balance for output over a three-month period dropped to -54 in May from -21 in April, its lowest reading since the series began in July 1975.
A gauge of industrial orders sank to its lowest since October 1981 at -62 in May from -56 last month, a somewhat bigger decline than economists had predicted in a Reuters poll.
""UK manufacturers are still grappling with the impact of the pandemic. Production levels have fallen even more sharply as firms experience collapsing demand and supply chain disruption, leading some to temporarily shut down their factories,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
Around three quarters of manufacturers reported cashflow problems and they are not much more positive about the outlook, with the output expectations balance for the next three months rising to -49 from -67 in April.
Earlier on Thursday a separate survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector also painted a gloomy picture for May.

The most recent official data show that factory output fell by 4.6% in March, when a lockdown began towards the end of the month, though factories themselves were not required to close.

692,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>",Euro zone slump eased in May but still sharp,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - The devastating impact of the coronavirus on the euro zone economy abated a little this month as some government-imposed lockdown measures introduced to contain the spread of the virus were eased, a survey showed.
Although thousands of cases of the virus -- which has infected just over 5 million people and killed more than 327,000 around the world -- are still being reported daily, countries such as Germany and France have started to reopen parts of their economies.
Having crashed to what was by far its lowest reading in the survey's nearly 22-year history last month, IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, recovered to 30.5 from April's 13.6.
But while that was much better than the median expectation of 25.0 in a Reuters poll, it was still a long way below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The big picture is that the index is consistent with economic activity in the region remaining very depressed even as lockdown measures are being gradually lifted,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
A loosening of lockdown measures in Germany helped services and manufacturers in Europe's largest economy gain some ground but as companies expected demand to remain weak for quite a while they continued to cut jobs.
It was a similar story in France, the only other euro zone country to report a flash PMI, where the business slump did not ease quite as much as expected.
In Britain, which has reported the highest COVID-19 related death toll in Europe, the economy flattened out a bit this month from its nosedive in April but remains in the grip of a severe contraction.
Equity markets slipped on Thursday on concerns about the long-term impact of the new coronavirus pandemic. 
CLIFF DIVE
Euro zone second-quarter GDP was likely to fall at an unprecedented rate of around 10% compared with the first quarter, IHS Markit said, marginally less severe than the 11.3% slump predicted in a Reuters poll last week. 
However, the rise in the PMI adds to expectations that the downturn should continue to moderate as lockdown restrictions are further lifted heading into the summer.
Still, with citizens largely told to stay home this month, demand remained weak and the new business index came in at a very low 28.4, albeit up from April's record low of 13.6.
The ongoing slump comes despite the European Central Bank pledging to buy more than 1 trillion euros in assets this year and governments outlining hundreds of billions in spending plans to support businesses and households.
There was an improvement in the battered services sector, which has borne the brunt of lockdown measures. The flash PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry rose to 28.7 from 12.0, exceeding expectations in a Reuters poll for 25.0.
Meanwhile, a manufacturing PMI rose to 39.5 from 33.4, beating expectations for 38.0. An index measuring output almost doubled to 35.4 from 18.1.
Services firms cut prices for a third month, possibly giving the ECB room to offer more support. The output prices index remained sub-50 at 43.0 compared to last month's 40.2.

With lockdowns easing -- and infection rates in the region falling -- factory purchasing managers were less pessimistic. The manufacturing future output index climbed to 45.0 from 36.6.

An index measuring activity in the dominant services sector and in manufacturing rose to 28.9 in May's preliminary purchasing managers' index from 13.8 in April's final reading.
IHS Markit, which publishes the data, said the pace of decline remained far worse than at any point during the global financial crisis a decade ago.
But Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist, said he expected a further improvement next month.
""June should hopefully be better as lockdown restrictions ease,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Andrew Wishart, an economist with Capital Economics reaffirmed his forecast of a 20% slump in the economy between April and June. ""Much more importantly, we expect the pace of the recovery to be sluggish,"" he said.
IHS Markit said companies reported a severe lack of new business and, although business expectations improved for a second month in a row, many firms said they were worried it would take a long time to recover.
Some service sector companies remained deeply pessimistic about their near-term prospects.
Britain's chief budget forecaster said on Sunday that April was probably the bottom of the crash as the government is now moving to gradually ease its lockdown restrictions but that the economy was unlikely to bounce back.
IHS Markit said many firms which had temporarily laid off workers had furloughed more than half their staff, using an emergency government scheme to pay 80% of their wages.
Employment was down again in May although the fall was a bit less precipitous than in April.
Prices charged by companies fell and input costs were also lower apart from in manufacturing, where companies reported higher costs for freight and from having to seek alternative suppliers as well as from a fall in the value of the pound.
IHS Markit said the ""flash"" May reading for the services sector rose to 27.8 from 13.4 in April while the manufacturing sector PMI increased to 40.6 from 32.6.

IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 31.4 after hitting a record low of 17.4 the previous month.
This undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a bigger increase to 34.1. It marked the third month in a row that the index was below the 50 threshold which separates growth from contraction.
""The rate of decline in activity has eased considerably since the peak of virus containment measures in April, but we are still a long way off business as usual and the path to recovery remains unclear,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
The services sector, which was hit hardest by the gradually imposed lockdown measures since mid-March, recovered a bit. The flash PMI for business activity in services jumped to 31.4 in May after hitting a record low of 15.9 the previous month.
The flash PMI for manufacturing rose to 36.8 from 34.5 in April.
Smith said companies expected demand to remain weak for quite a while so they continued to cut jobs ""at a worrying rate"" in order to better align capacity with current conditions.
""The scale of job losses is a key risk to the longer-term outlook,"" he added.
The government expects the coronavirus pandemic to plunge the economy into its deepest recession since World War Two, predicting an unprecedented contraction of 6.3% this year.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz are working on a fiscal stimulus package including ""timely, targeted, temporary and transformative"" measures to help companies recover from the crisis.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its composite purchasing managers' index rose to 30.5 from a record low of 11.1 in April when vast swathes of the economy were shuttered.
The improvement fell just short of economists' average prediction in a Reuters poll for 32.0 and was still far from the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in business activity from a contraction.
Most shops and factories that had to close during the lockdown began reopening on May 11 when it was lifted, though cafes, bars and restaurants remain shut until early June.
""The data highlights the difficulties economies may face in the recovery from this crisis, as firms continue to lay off workers amid a persistently uncertain outlook,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
The euro zone's second-biggest economy suffered its deepest recession since modern records began in 1948 in the first quarter, contracting 5.8% from the previous three months, the INSEE stats agency said last month.
But the second quarter may be far worse.
""Given the sharp contraction in first quarter GDP caused by only two weeks in lockdown, the latest PMI data suggest that we are set for a colossal reduction in economic activity during the second quarter,"" Kerr said.
The data showed that in France's dominant services sector the PMI rose to 29.4 from 10.2 in March, missing the 27.8 expected on average by economists.
Meanwhile in manufacturing, the PMI rose to 40.3 from 31.5, exceeding the 36.1 that economists had been expecting.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell the most since the 2009 global financial crisis in April as the coronavirus pandemic slammed world demand for cars, industrial materials and other goods, likely pushing the world's third-largest economy deeper into recession.
The ugly trade numbers come as policymakers seek to balance virus containment measures against the need to revive battered parts of the economy, with the risk of a second wave of infections only complicating this challenge.
The central bank will hold an emergency meeting on Friday to work out a scheme that would encourage financial institutions to lend to smaller, struggling firms. Policymakers are also considering cash injections for companies of all sizes.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data on Thursday showed Japan's exports fell 21.9% in April year-on-year as U.S.-bound shipments slumped 37.8%, the fastest decline since 2009, with car exports there plunging 65.8%.
Global automakers are struggling to cope with the health crisis, which has pummelled car sales due to lockdowns in many countries. Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) expects an 80% drop in full-year operating profit while Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) has reported an 89% drop in annual profit.
The fall in overall shipments was the biggest since October 2009 during the global financial crisis, but slightly less than a 22.7% decrease seen by economists in a Reuters poll. Exports fell 11.7% in March.
""It's still far from a fully fledged resumption of economic activity,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""As exports and imports remain stagnant for a prolonged period of time, global trade will remain contractionary for the time being.""
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, fell 4.1% in the year to April, due to slumping demand for chemical materials, car parts and medicines.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese exports, declined 11.4%, and exports to the European Union fell 28.0%.
Other trade-reliant economies in Asia have also been hit with data on Thursday showing South Korea's exports slumping by a fifth in the first 20 days of May, year-on-year.
Industry data released last week showed Japan's machine tool orders in April fell to their lowest level in more than a decade, a sign of deteriorating business spending.
Japan's economy slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years, putting the nation on course for its deepest postwar slump as the pandemic ravages businesses and consumers.
Monday's first-quarter GDP data underlined the broadening impact of the outbreak, with first quarter exports plunging the most since the devastating March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
A private sector manufacturing survey showed on Thursday the decline in Japan's factory activity accelerated in May as output and orders slumped.

Analysts warn of an even bleaker picture for the current quarter as consumption crumbled after the government in April requested citizens to stay home and businesses to close.

Of 44 million workers in vulnerable sectors, about 31 million female workers face potential job cuts compared to 13 million men, underscoring that women globally are more vulnerable to losing their jobs during the crisis. The assessment excludes China, with the figure likely to be higher if the world’s second-largest economy was included.
Citi estimates more than 220 million women are in sectors vulnerable to job cuts amid the pandemic. If approximately 31 million women in six key sectors lost their jobs, that could mean an equivalent loss to real global GDP of as much as $1 trillion.
“The greater vulnerability of women to job losses is due to the segmentation of female laborers into sectors that are the most negatively affected by coronavirus disruptions,” Citi economists Dana Peterson and Catherine Mann wrote in a research note.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports for the first 20 days of May tumbled 20.3% from the same period a year earlier, as U.S.- and E.U.-bound shipments continued to collapse, highlighting the damage on global demand from the coronavirus pandemic. 
But that decline was milder than the 27.6% drop over April 1-20, and analysts are predicting that trade data may have bottomed out as the country's trading partners ease coronavirus lockdowns.
Monthly trade data from Asia's fourth-largest economy is considered a bellwether for world trade as it is the first to be released among major exporting nations.
Imports sank 16.9% - versus 18.5% a month earlier - resulting in a provisional trade deficit of $2.68 billion for the period, the Korea Customs Service data showed on Thursday.
""Exports look like they're faring better than last month. It's possible exports bottomed out in April,"" said economist Chun Kyu-yeon at Hana Financial Investment. ""Quick recovery in China and Korea is pushing up production.""
Shipments to South Korea's biggest trading partner, China, fell only 1.7% on year as factories there resumed operation, while those to the United States and the European Union dropped 27.9% and 18.4% respectively.

700,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>","Fed debates longer-term crisis-fighting plan, minutes show","By Howard Schneider and Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir
(Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers, still working to fully roll out a multi-trillion-dollar effort to shore up financial markets and an economy cratered by the coronavirus pandemic, last month dove into a new debate: how best to support the economy during a recovery they now agree could be slower and more fraught than initially thought.
Among ideas U.S. central bankers discussed at April's policy-setting meeting, according to minutes released Wednesday: more detailed guidance for the path of short-term interest rates, and capping long-term interest rates.
The Fed used the former in the last crisis; the latter would be a first for the Fed.
There was no discussion of negative interest rates, a controversial approach to policy supported by U.S. President Donald Trump and in use in Europe and Japan, but seen by U.S. central bankers as risky and ineffective.
With tens of millions of Americans without work in an economy expected to shrink at its fastest rate ever amid widespread business shutdowns to limit the virus' spread, the Fed has embarked on an all-out effort to calm markets, forestall mass bankruptcies, and set the stage for a faster recovery.
It has slashed interest rates to near zero, bought trillions of dollars of bonds, and initiated a raft of lending programs, including one for medium-sized businesses which it hopes to launch later this month.
At their April 28-29 meeting, policymakers re-upped a pledge to keep interest rates near zero until they are confident the U.S. economy is on track to recovery, but they also were sharply focused on continuing to deliver support to a nation that some worried could experience a ""protracted period of severely reduced economic activity,"" especially if new waves of infection emerged.
""While participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, they noted that the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions,"" according to the minutes, released Wednesday with the usual three-week lag.
Some participants called for more precise forward guidance for the path of interest rates, like tying any change to rates to achieving specific economic milestones on unemployment or inflation, or to specific dates, an approach the Fed used during the last crisis.
Other possibilities discussed included giving guidance on bond purchases, the minutes showed, and using Treasury purchases to cap long-term borrowing costs, an approach employed by some other global central banks.
Completing a monetary policy framework review launched last year, several policymakers thought, could also help clarify the Fed's policy intentions.
""Fed officials remain concerned the pandemic could have more long-lasting effects,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics.
Participants overall agreed that their recent actions had been ""essential in helping reduce downside risks to the economic outlook,"" the minutes showed. They also repeated calls for further fiscal support, which so far has amounted to nearly $3 trillion even as lawmakers continue to debate the size and scope of a further rescue package.
But with a number of Fed policymakers seeing ""a substantial likelihood of additional waves of outbreak in the near or medium term,"" the minutes suggested central bankers may be reaching for better tools to navigate what could be a rocky recovery.
More than 36 million U.S. workers have filed unemployment insurance claims since mid-March when states began putting stay-at-home orders in place. Economists expect the unemployment rate to approach or surpass the 25% record set during the Great Depression. Forecasters say they expect the U.S. economy to shrink by as much as half this quarter, on an annual basis.
States are now easing restrictions, raising the hope of a gradual return to economic growth in the third and fourth quarters, but also the risk of new infections and more death.

More than 90,000 Americans have died of the highly contagious respiratory illness the virus causes, with daily deaths averaging 1,600 a day this month, according to Reuters data.

Investing.com - Federal Reserve members expressed caution on the prospect of a speedy economic recovery and remained committed to keeping policy accommodative until the economy has weathered the pandemic's impact, according to the minutes of their April meeting out Wednesday.
At the conclusion of its previous meeting on April 29, the FOMC kept its benchmark rate unchanged in a range of 0% to 0.25% and vowed to keep rates lower to ensure that an eventual economic recovery will be robust.
""Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the minutes showed.
In a dire assessment of the road to economic recovery, committee members agreed that the impact of the coronavirus would ""weigh heavily on growth in the near term, and posed considerable downside risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."" Growth is expected to return in the second half of the year, but it is unlikely a full recovery would be made by year-end.  
A few members, meanwhile, floated the idea of yield curve control to support economic growth.
""A few participants also noted that the balance sheet could be used to reinforce the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate through Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securities on a scale necessary to keep Treasury yields at short to medium-term maturities capped at specified levels for a period of time,"" the minutes said.
Looking ahead, some Fed members also expressed a need for more clarity on policy, allowing market participants to assess the conditions that may lead to a change of future monetary policy. 
""Some participants commented that the Committee could make its forward guidance for the path for the federal funds rate more explicit. For example, the Committee could adopt outcome-based forward guidance that would specify macroeconomic outcomes—such as a certain level of the unemployment rate or of the inflation rate—that must be achieved before the Committee would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee could also consider date-based forward guidance that would indicate that the target range could be raised only after a specified amount of time had elapsed.""
The unwavering conviction from the U.S. central bank to do whatever it takes to support the economy was recently echoed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
Powell told the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday that the Fed will use whatever it can muster to fight the economic impact of Covid-19.
“We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time even as we recognize that these actions are only a part of a broader public-sector response,” Powell said, according to Bloomberg.
As well as the two emergency rate cuts in March, the Fed has unveiled 10 separate lending programs to boost liquidity and support businesses and consumers."

Analysts had forecast a negative rate of 0.1% in April, down from 0.9% recorded in March. Excluding energy prices, annual inflation rose by 1.6%.
The last time Canada recorded a negative annual inflation rate was in September 2009, when prices fell by 0.9%.
But Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said the data was unlikely to fully capture the current situation, with non-essential businesses shuttered and people urged to stay home.
""This is not at all reflective of the pricing environment that consumers are actually facing,"" Mendes said.
Food prices jumped 3.4% in April, Statscan said, as demand remained high. Prices for pantry staples like rice (+9.2%), eggs (+8.8%) and margarine (+7.9%) soared as consumers, following health officials' recommendations to limit trips to grocery stores, turned to non-perishable food items.
""Prices for essentials matter more at this stage,"" Josh Nye, senior economist at RBC Economics, said in a note. ""In that sense, an increase in food prices in April likely hurts more than a drop in gasoline prices helps.""
Energy prices sank by 23.7% from April 2019. Gasoline prices plunged 39.3%, the largest year-over-year decline on record, on lower global demand for oil and a production war between Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The Canadian dollar pared its rise, touching 1.3891, or 71.99 cents U.S., after the domestic inflation data.

CPI common, which the Canadian central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, dipped to 1.6% from 1.7%. CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, stayed at 2.0%, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, was unchanged at 1.8%.

(Reuters) - The number of U.S. borrowers seeking help on mortgages, credit cards and auto loans jumped between March and April in the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, a  TransUnion  (N:TRU) study released on Wednesday showed.
Serious delinquency rates for accounts 60 or more days past due were little changed across loan types, but forbearance programs and stimulus payments have been helping consumers stay liquid in the short term, said Matt Komos, vice president of research and consulting at the credit monitoring firm.
""While these programs are providing consumers with temporary relief, banks and lenders are looking for further regulatory guidance as to what next steps should be taken once stimulus packages dry up,"" he said. ""We are likely to have a better sense of the true financial health of consumers impacted by COVID-19 in the coming months.""
Another early indicator points to a steeper deterioration of credit quality. The percentage of credit cards considered in hardship, or having a deferred payment or frozen account, rose to 3.2% from 0.1% in March and 0.03% a year earlier. Five percent of mortgages were considered in hardship, up from 0.5% in both March and the year ago period.
The hardship numbers may still be understated as some major lenders have promised to protect customers from negative credit impacts related to the pandemic. Large lenders including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) have said they would not immediately report participation in COVID-19 assistance programs to credit reporting agencies.

In the southern Algarve, usually packed with tourists but now nearly deserted, just over 4,700 people registered as unemployed in April, bringing the total out of work to 26,379 - nearly 15,000 or 123% more than this time last year, data from the Institute for Employment and Vocational Training showed.
In Portugal as whole, just over 48,500 registered as unemployed in April, a 22% year-on-year jump, bringing the total of those without jobs to around 392,000 people.
Around 71% of the newly unemployed worked in the services sector including restaurants and retail stores, which were shut after Portugal declared a state of emergency on March 18 but are now slowly reopening as part of a sector-by-sector lockdown exit plan put in place from May 4.
Earlier this month, Finance Minister Mario Centeno said the unemployment rate could hit around 10% by the end of the year, compared with 6.7% reported during the first quarter of 2020.
The unemployment rate had been falling as the country slowly recovered from the debt crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak, so far numbering 29,432 confirmed cases and 1,247 deaths, is set to hammer Portugal's economy: the International Monetary Fund expects gross domestic product to contract by 8% this year, while the European Commission predicts a 6.8% drop.

More than 1 million workers in Portugal have been laid off since the pandemic. The layoff scheme allows firms to temporarily suspend jobs or reduce working hours instead of firing workers.

706,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",Euro zone April inflation revised down to nearly four-year low,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone annual inflation in April was 0.3%, the lowest level in nearly four years, according to final data released on Wednesday by Eurostat, which revised down its earlier estimate as energy prices fell more than initially expected.
The European Union statistics agency had previously estimated that consumer prices in the 19-nation currency bloc rose 0.4% on the year in April, but on Wednesday lowered the figure to 0.3%, the lowest since August 2016.
Headline inflation confirmed its slowing trend since the start of the year, dropping from 0.7% in March, 1.2% in February and 1.4% in January, farther away from the European Central Bank target of a rate below but close to 2% over the medium term.
The revision was caused by a larger-than-expected fall in energy prices, amid the coronavirus crisis and the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, two major producers of petroleum.
Eurostat said energy prices in the bloc fell 9.7% in April year-on-year, revising down its earlier estimate of a 9.6% drop.
Excluding energy prices, inflation in the bloc rose to 1.4% in April from 1.3% in March, Eurostat data showed, mostly driven by higher prices in supermarkets.
On the year, food, alcohol and tobacco prices went up by 3.6% in April from 2.4% in March, as consumers stocked up on goods during the pandemic.
In the services sector, the largest in the bloc's economy, inflation was 1.2% in April year-on-year, down from 1.3% in March. 
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food components - what the ECB calls core inflation - prices grew 1.1% on the year, down from 1.2% in March, confirming earlier estimates.
An even narrower measure of inflation that excludes also alcohol and tobacco prices and is followed by many market economists, showed prices going up 0.9% year-on-year, against a 1.0% annual increase in March, in line with previous estimates.

Month-on-month, Eurostat confirmed inflation in the euro zone rose 0.3%.

707,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",UK inflation slumps to lowest since 2016 as coronavirus hits,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate sank in April to its lowest since August 2016 as the coronavirus pandemic pushed down global oil prices and clothing stores slashed prices, bolstering the prospect of more Bank of England stimulus next month.
Consumer price inflation dropped to an annual rate of 0.8%from 1.5% in March, official data showed on Wednesday. That was the sharpest one-month fall in over a decade and took inflation further below the BoE's 2% target. Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent has said it could drop below zero by the end of 2020.
The BoE increased its bond-buying programme by a record 200 billion pounds in March as the COVID-19 crisis escalated, and many economists expect another increase on June 18.
Markets see a chance the BoE could cut interest rates below zero for the first time by the end of the year.
Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said underlying price growth would stay subdued as weak demand more than offset any inflationary impact from the pandemic. 
""Against this background, we expect the Bank to expand its quantitative easing programme further,"" she said.
The Office for National Statistics says inflation readings were likely to be volatile because the coronavirus shutdown has kept its price-checkers from getting prices on more than a fifth of goods and services, forcing the ONS to estimate them or use substitutes.
Declining prices for energy bills, transport - which includes petrol - and clothing and footwear, causing biggest drop in inflation.
The ONS said clothing retailers, hit by the government's stay-at-home orders, resorted to more discount sales and prices dropped by the most since 2010, down an annual 2.9%.
Household utility bills dropped by the most since 2009, reflecting previously announced price caps.
But there was upward pressure from the price of video games and consoles, board games and children's toys, as well as fresh vegetables, the ONS said.
Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, held broadly steady at an annual rate of 1.5%.
Retail price inflation - an older measure which the ONS says is inaccurate, but is widely used in bond markets and for other commercial contracts - dropped to 1.5% from 2.6%.
The dip in the CPI below 1% will require BoE Governor Andrew Bailey to explain to the government how the central bank will attempt to push it back up.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales slumped in April after a record surge the previous month as widespread restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus hit demand for clothing, travel and dining out.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported on Wednesday its preliminary estimate of retail sales plunged a seasonally adjusted 17.9% in April, its biggest ever, from an 8.5% jump in March.
The figures showed heavy falls in every industry, with turnover in clothing, and cafes, restaurants and takeaways around half the level of April 2019.
The final estimate of sales is due on June 4.
Reflecting the dour consumer mood, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s cashless retail sales index, which measures debit card, credit card and other cashless spending on NAB platforms, fell 5.3% in April. 
""The hole blown in discretionary retail is unlikely to be filled any time soon,"" NAB Group chief economist Alan Oster said.
""With our latest economic forecasts pointing to unemployment at 11.7% by mid-year and remaining above pre-crisis levels over the next 18 months, consumers are unlikely to have a great deal of discretionary spending power.""
Strict social distancing rules began in mid-March, forcing many businesses to close. While some restrictions have eased this month it will be a while before activity fully returns.
""More fiscal stimulus will probably be needed to put the Australian economy back closer to pre-crisis levels,"" Oster added.
Australia is facing its biggest ever fall in economic activity and its first recession in 30 years. 
To cushion the economic blow, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) slashed interest rates to a record low 0.25% in March and launch an unlimited quantitative easing programme. The federal government is also splashing cash, including a A$130 billion ($85 billion) wage subsidy scheme.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders slipped in March, suggesting a widening hit to the economy from the coronavirus although the pace of decline was offset by a large number of orders for big-ticket items.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, edged down 0.4% in March from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
The drop followed a 2.3% gain in February and was better than a 7.1% decline predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
""The small decline in orders in March is likely to give way to a collapse in investment across this quarter,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""The ominous plunge in domestic machine tool orders in April suggests 'core' machinery orders fell sharply last month,"" he wrote in a note.
Japan's tool machinery orders in April fell to their lowest level in more than a decade, preliminary data showed last week.
The world's third-largest economy slipped into a deepening recession in the last quarter, underlining the broadening impact from the pandemic which has hit trade-reliant nations such as Japan particularly hard.
The sluggish machinery orders data came after the Reuters Tankan survey on Wednesday showed the slump in Japanese business confidence deepened to a more than decade low in May as firms braced for a growing hit from the virus.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged a second supplementary budget later this month, on top of the recently announced record $1.1 trillion stimulus package, to help business and households get through the period of economic weakness.
By sector, manufacturers' orders dropped 8.2%, weighed by pulp and paper products and cars and car parts, while core orders from the service-sector rose 5.3%, led by an 82% jump in orders from the transportation and postal sub-sector.
The March reading was largely driven by a higher than usual number of orders for big-ticket items, including four for the service-sector.
The Bank of Japan will hold an emergency policy meeting on Friday to set up a reward scheme for financial institutions that boost lending to small firms hit by the pandemic.
The central bank in April boosted the amount of corporate bonds and commercial paper it can buy to ease corporate funding strains. It also pledged to buy an unlimited amount of bonds to keep borrowing costs low.
From a year earlier, core machinery orders were down 0.7% in March, beating an expected 9.5% decline and following a 2.4% fall in February.

The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index climbed to 52.3 from 42.6 in April, its largest month-on-month improvement since January 2015, but remained far below the 77.3 recorded in early March. 
The April fall was the sharpest month-on-month decline in the survey's 24-year history and May's level is within the lowest 5% of readings recorded, the authors said. 
""While the improvement ... should be seen as encouraging, the level of the May sentiment survey remains comparable with responses seen through the more difficult moments of the financial crisis (a decade ago),"" Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Ireland, said.
Ireland in March shut bars, restaurants and non-essential retail outlets and ordered people to stay at home, measures that will be gradually relaxed during the coming three months, starting this week.
The damage to the economy has been severe, with the unemployment rate, including those receiving emergency COVID-19-related jobless benefits, shooting up to 28.2% from 4.8% in two months.
The survey's authors linked the improvement to a slowing of the spread of the disease in recent weeks combined with the beginning of the phased easing of the lockdown. 
But eight out of 10 consumers still expected the economy to weaken in the following 12 months down from nine in 10 in May.
The survey found that 86% of consumers expected the Irish government to introduce cutbacks in public spending or tax increases within the next two to three years. 

The threat of a return to austerity ""could translate into an economic 'second wave'"", Hughes said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The slump in Japanese business confidence deepened in May, hitting decade lows as firms braced for a protracted period of coronavirus-driven economic weakness, the Reuters Tankan survey showed on Wednesday.
The downbeat findings came after data this week showed the world's third-largest economy slipped into its first recession in 4-1/2 years last quarter, as the broadening impact of the highly contagious virus depressed business and consumer activity at home and abroad.
The sentiment index at manufacturers slumped to minus 44 in May from minus 30 in the previous month, the lowest since June 2009, while the service-sector gauge plunged to minus 36 from minus 23, according to the Reuters Tankan poll, the worst reading since December 2009. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.
The survey showed both manufacturers and service-sector firms expected to see an even sharper fall in business sentiment in the three months ahead, at minus 51 and minus 48 in August, respectively.
""Domestic market conditions aren't stable due to the impact of the novel coronavirus,"" a manager at a chemicals firm wrote in the survey.
A manager at a construction firm said: ""There's plenty of construction work at hand, although private capital investment is decreasing.""
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged a second supplementary budget later this month, on top of the recently announced record $1.1 trillion stimulus package, to help business and households tide over the pandemic's impact.
Except for the information/communications sector, all industry categories across the manufacturing and the service sector were pessimistic about business conditions, according to the Reuters poll of 499 large- and mid-sized non-financial companies, of which 236 firms responded on condition of anonymity.

The depth of despair in the business sector reinforces analysts' expectations that Japan is on course for its worst postwar economic slump, with a Reuters poll forecasting an annualised GDP decline of 22% in the current quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding dropped by the most on record in April and permits for future construction tumbled, underlining fears that the coronavirus crisis would lead to the deepest economic contraction in the second quarter since the Great Depression.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday added to dismal data this month showing a staggering loss of 20.5 million jobs. In addition to a collapse in retail sales and manufacturing production, the data suggests that April was probably the worst month so far in the current economic downturn.
""This is an unprecedented recession in that it happened over just two months and this is making it harder for companies and consumers to get their bearings and figure out what to do next,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Housing starts tumbled 30.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 891,000 units last month, the lowest level since early 2015. The percentage decline was the biggest since the government started tracking the series in 1959. Starts dropped 18.6% in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts would fall to a pace of 927,000 units in April. 
Homebuilding fell in all four regions last month. Housing starts plunged 29.7% on a year-on-year basis in April.
Though many states considered homebuilding as essential when they enforced lockdown orders in mid-March to curb the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, disruptions to building material supply chains likely weighed on activity in the last couple of months.
As the country gradually reopens, there are indications the worst of the homebuilding slump is likely over. A survey on Monday showed an increase in homebuilder confidence in May. With at least 21.4 million people having lost their jobs in March and April, however, the housing market could remain subdued for a while even with mortgage rates near record lows. 
""Fewer people are going to be interested in buying a home and committing themselves to years of mortgage payments when they are concerned about their job and income prospects,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mostly higher. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed after posting hefty gains on Monday amid hopes for a vaccine for COVID-19.
RECORD CONTRACTION EXPECTED
Permits for future home construction plunged 20.8% to a rate of 1.074 million units in April, the lowest level since January 2015. The despite the sharp drop, permits are outpacing starts, which bodes well for homebuilding in the coming months.
The housing market was back on the recovery path before the coronavirus pandemic struck, after hitting a soft patch that started in the first quarter of 2018 and lasted through the second quarter of 2019. The sector, which has a bigger footprint on the economy, was partly stymied by a chronic shortage of properties for sale. 
It has expanded for three straight quarters. But as with every other segment of the economy, economists are expecting a steep housing market contraction in the second quarter. 
Economists are estimating that gross domestic product (GDP) will shrink at as much as a 43% annualized rate in the second quarter, the deepest since the 1930s. The economy contracted at a 4.8% pace in the January-March quarter.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 25.4% to a rate of 650,000 units in April, the lowest level since March 2015. Single-family building permits declined 24.3% to a rate of 669,000 units, also the lowest since March 2015.
In the volatile multi-family housing segment, starts dived 40.5% to a rate of 241,000 units last month. Permits for multi-family units fell 14.2% to a rate of 405,100 units.

Housing completions dropped 8.1% to 1.176 million last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. The stock of houses under construction fell 1.7% to 1.195 million units.

The median forecast of 10 analysts was for inflation to pick up to 2.46% during early May from 2.21% in the second half of April, giving the Bank of Mexico room to consider further monetary policy loosening in the coming months.
The central bank last week lowered its benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 5.50% and hinted further rate cuts could follow with the economy likely to suffer a major contraction in the second quarter due to the coronavirus crisis.
""We believe inflation will stay below the 3% target in the coming months ... the short-term dynamics will support further cuts in the benchmark rate in June and August,"" Mexican bank Banorte said in a report.
Compared with the previous two-week period, prices were seen falling 0.07%, though the core index was expected to increase 0.12%, the survey showed. Annual core inflation was expected to accelerate to 3.64% from 3.61% in late April.

BERLIN (Reuters) - As workers across Germany downed tools during the coronavirus crisis and the economy slipped into recession, Berlin-based K. Rogge Spezialbau kept its builders busy at work.
The specialist in interiors and facade renovations is one of Germany's many construction firms that has kept the nation moving even when much of Europe's biggest economy ground to a halt.
""Our company and the construction sector in general are definitely doing far better in this coronavirus crisis than companies in other sectors,"" said Klaus-Dieter Mueller, a managing partner at the firm which employs 170 people.
""So we can't really complain,"" he told Reuters.
The coronavirus crisis has pushed Germany's already slowing economy into a formal recession, after a 2.2% contraction in the first quarter followed a revised 0.1% fall in output in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Yet, construction industry, the Germany's biggest employer, helped prevent a sharper slowdown that others have faced in Europe, such as France and Italy, whose economies shrank by 5.8% and 4.7% in the first quarter, respectively.
Unlike France, Italy, Britain and Spain, where construction sites fell silent for weeks, Germany's 16 states allowed factories to operate and construction work to continue if workers adhered to social distancing and other safety rules.
Many German firms still shuttered plants, such as carmakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG), normally the engines of Germany's export-led economy.
But Germany's builders, who started 2020 with a record-high backlog of new orders, kept going. The sector even expanded by 1.8% in March, compared to a rise of 1% a year earlier.
The car industry, meanwhile, contracted by 31% in March.
LAYOFFS UNLIKELY
""The health of the construction sector will play a role in stabilising the economy this year, like it did last year,"" said Michael Voigtlaender of the IW Koeln German Economic Institute.
The sector, which accounts for about 10% of national output, has been booming since 2010, fuelled by record-low borrowing costs, government incentives, higher spending on infrastructure and housing shortages.
Voigtlaender said the industry had faced labour shortages going into the crisis, which meant that even if some projects were cancelled in a downturn it would unlikely translate into layoffs from the sector.
The ZDB construction industry association said in April that only 37% of building firms had seen contract cancellations and only one in 10 said the pandemic has seriously disrupted business.
Relatively few building firms shifted employees to short-time work, a form of state aid that allows them to put staff on shorter working hours during a downturn to keep them on payroll.
Only 37% of builders were using the scheme in April, compared with 94% of companies in the car sector, according to a survey by the Ifo economic institute.
The industry still faces challenges. Infrastructure contractors worry that municipalities responsible for about two thirds of German infrastructure spending could cancel or delay some projects as tax revenues plunge due to the crisis.
Tim Lorenz, managing director at EUROVIA Germany, a road and railway engineering company, said his firm had fared well in March and April, only switching 5% of its 4,000 employees to short-time work following the cancellation of three projects.
""We expect this number to rise in the second half of the year in the absence of a political strategy to keep investments in infrastructure alive,"" he said. ""The overall outlook for the coming months is becoming less positive.""

The German economy is facing its deepest recession since World War Two, even as authorities have started to ease lockdown measures put in place to contain the spread of the disease.
The ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors rose to 51.0 from 28.2 in April. Economists had expected a reading of 32.0.
""Optimism is growing that there will be an economic turnaround from summer onwards,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions edged down to -93.5 from -91.5 in the previous month. Analysts had forecast a reading of -88.0.
Investors expect the German economy to pick up pace again in the fourth quarter, Wambach said, but he added that the recovery would probably take a while. ""Only in 2022, will economic output return to the levels of 2019,"" he added.
Financial markets on Tuesday continued to welcome German- and French-led plans for a 500 billion euro ($547.60 billion) EU recovery fund to help European countries and business sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
However, the DIHK chambers of industry and commerce said earlier on Tuesday that it expected the German economy to shrink at least 10% this year, a much more pessimistic view than the government's forecast.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people claiming unemployment benefits in Britain leapt in April to its highest level in nearly 24 years, giving the clearest sign yet of the hit from the coronavirus to jobs which is set to deepen in the coming months.
Data published on Tuesday showed the claimant count rose by 856,500 -- the biggest ever month-on-month jump -- to 2.1 million, a 69% increase from March.
It was the highest level since July 1996, when Britain's economy was still recovering from a deep recession caused by its failed bid to stay in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which had pushed interest rates to 15% in 1992.
April's surge would have been even sharper without an emergency government programme to pay 80% of the wages of 8 million employees -- or about one in four workers -- put on temporary leave, who are not counted as unemployed.
""I think we should be prepared for the unemployment rate to increase significantly,"" Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Therese Coffey told BBC radio.
Recent changes to Britain's welfare system mean the claimant count number includes more people than normal who are still in work but have suffered a big drop in earnings. But the surge in claims showed the scale of the hit to the labour market.
""While only covering the first weeks of restrictions, our figures show COVID-19 is having a major impact on the labour market,"" Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the Office for National Statistics, said.
A Reuters poll of economists had produced a median forecast for a leap of 676,500 in the claimant count, with forecasts ranging widely from just over 56,000 to as high as 1.5 million.
Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said the government's wage subsidy scheme was holding off some job losses for now but it was not clear how firms would react when they are required to help fund it from August.
""Many companies will still be in the middle of a cashflow crisis,"" he said. ""Government faces an onerous task in winding down the scheme without causing too much pain."" 
VACANCIES PLUNGE, PAYROLL TOTAL FALLS
Vacancies fell by the most on record in the February-April period with hospitality job openings dropping the most. 
Experimental data, based on tax figures, showed the number of people on companies' payrolls fell by 1.6% in April from March, equivalent to the loss of nearly 450,000 jobs.
George Brown, an economist with Investec, said the claimant count and vacancies figures probably underestimated the scale of the hit to the jobs market because they reflected the picture at the start of April.
Other data served as a reminder of how strong Britain's labour market was going into the COVID-19 crisis. 
Britain's unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in the January-March period, which covered only one week of the lockdown which began on March 23, from 4.0% in the three months to February.
Growth in pay slowed but employment expanded by a much stronger-than-expected 211,000.
But with much of the economy shut down by the government, Britain could be heading for its sharpest economic slump in more than 300 years, the Bank of England has warned.

The country's budget forecasters say unemployment could hit 10% in the April-June period, even with millions of workers shielded by the government's wage subsidy scheme.

In April, new car registrations dropped by 78.3% to 292,182 vehicles in the European Union, Britain and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, statistics from the European Auto Industry Association (ACEA) showed.
Sales recorded a double-digit fall in all EU markets, with Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain - hit particularly hard by the pandemic - reporting the biggest drops of 97.6%, 97,3% and 96,5% respectively. 
Registrations tumbled by 61.1% in Germany and 88.8% in France.

721,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",China Is Days Away From Revealing If It Dumped Its GDP Growth Target,"(Bloomberg) --
When Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivers his annual report on economic policy this Friday, there’s a chance that the document’s most important number will be missing.
The target for gross domestic product growth is usually the anchor for the nation’s system of policy making, but the coronavirus crisis this year has led to such great uncertainty that officials have considered abandoning it altogether.
If the leadership does decide to publish a numerical target at the National People’s Congress as in previous years, it has faced the dilemma of where to set it: Too high a number risks binding officials to costly stimulus and higher debt. Too low a number makes plain that the government won’t meet its own objective of doubling the size of the economy this decade.
“This year, if a target is adopted, it may look more like a forecast than a task to be accomplished at any cost,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist of Greater China & North Asia at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank in Hong Kong, forecasting the goal will be kept flexible at around 2% to 3%. “A more flexible GDP target suggests wider deviations from the number would be allowed if justified by domestic or external shocks.”
The coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing lockdown measures have paralyzed the economy as well as its conventional political schedule, with the annual session of the NPC about two months late. With 2020 almost half way through, the leadership has said little about the economic targets to guide market expectations and help ministries and provinces make their own plans.
The consensus forecast for economic growth this year is just 1.8%. The shutdowns in the first quarter are easing only gradually, global demand is likely to remain depressed and the nation still faces the risk of a second wave of infections.
Although China’s $14 trillion economy has moved toward being market-led in recent years, much still depends on a Soviet-style system of planned quotas and targets. 2020 is the final year of the current Five Year Plan. Government spending and investment objectives, both usually included in Li’s annual Work Report, by nature depend on a top-line growth number as a guide. Ministries and local officials take their cue from the GDP goal, and projects on everything from infrastructure spending to poverty alleviation would reference it.
The government has blurred the annual growth target before, though in different circumstances. In 2001, just before the nation joined the World Trade Organization and was setting off on a decade of break-neck growth, then-premier Zhu Rongji referenced an average target of 7% over the span of the 10th Five Year Plan -- a goal that was ultimately exceeded.
Dropping the target entirely now may cause disorientation and inconsistency in policy execution, a reason some economists have argued that it will appear in some form.
“Even if they don’t announce one publicly, they’ll still have an implicit one to guide policy making,” said Larry Hu, head of China Economics at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong.
By setting an explicit number at a time when the recovery is fragile and more headwinds are coming, policy makers are risking their credibility. If export demand doesn’t improve, domestic sentiment worsens or another virus outbreak hits, the government will find itself tied to the obligation and being forced to resort to excessive stimulus. That’s an outcome that the government has strenuously tried to avoid throughout the U.S.-China trade war and the economy’s long structural slowdown.
A scenario forecast by JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economists is to not announce a numeric growth target, while focusing instead on economic and social stability issues, such as employment, food and energy security and supply chain stability.
“This is a realistic choice given that the economy still faces major internal and external uncertainties,” Haibin Zhu and other economists from the bank wrote in a note. “If the government continues to announce a numeric growth target, it runs the risk of either the target being too high or too low.”
Officials have already moved away from hard adherence to a numerical target in recent years, emphasizing more job creation, shifting to a range rather than a point target, and scrapping a numeric goal for money supply growth.
The function GDP targets traditionally play in the planning of the whole government apparatus “cannot indefinitely be a reason to continue setting growth targets,” said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics Ltd in Hong Kong. “At some point China will need to reform policy coordination between different parts and layers of the government.”

The share of mortgages in forbearance rose to 8.16% from 7.91% in the May 4-10 period, the industry lobbying group said, the smallest increase since March 16. The number of new requests for relief also fell relative to the prior week for the fifth consecutive survey period, the MBA said.
Ginnie Mae loans once again had the highest percentage of loans in forbearance by investor type, at 11.26% of loans. The share of Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) loans in forbearance increased to 6.25% from 6.08%.
The U.S. economy has cratered since mid-March as many stay-at-home orders were enacted across the country to limit the spread of the virus. Job losses have continued to mount, with more than 30 million people newly thrown out of work, although a majority of states have now partially reopened commerce.
""We will continue to closely monitor the forbearance request and call volume data for any sign of an uptick, but current trends suggest that if the economy continues to gradually reopen, the situation could be stabilizing,"" said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's senior vice president and chief economist.
As part of the $3 trillion financial relief package passed by Congress, borrowers with loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae can get six months of forbearance if they have been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, with a six-month extension possible. This covers 70% of the mortgage market.
Many banks and other lenders of non-agency mortgages are also allowing borrowers to enter into forbearance plans, usually for at least three months.

MBA's survey included data on 38.3 million loans, almost 77% of the first-mortgage servicing market.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose seven points to 37 this month after a record plunge in April. The closure of nonessential businesses in mid-March to limit the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, led to record job losses in April and a collapse in manufacturing output and retail sales.
Other indicators have also hinted at a rebound in housing activity, with mortgage applications rising in recent weeks. Still, homebuilder confidence remains low, suggesting the housing market recovery will be slow amid record unemployment. 
""As many states and localities across the nation lift stay-at-home orders and more furloughed workers return to their jobs, we expect this demand will strengthen,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ""However, high unemployment and supply-side challenges including builder loan access and building material availability are near-term limiting factors.""
The survey's measure of current sales conditions rose six points to 42. Its gauge of sales expectations in the next six months jumped 10 points to 46. The prospective buyers index increased eight points to 21 this month.

Confidence increased among homebuilders in the Midwest, South and West, but fell in the Northeast.

The pandemic hit Chile early in March, just as green shoots had begun to emerge following months of violent protests over inequality in late 2019 that had hammered the economy of the world´s top copper producer.
Chile moved quickly to close its borders and shutter most non-essential businesses, sending growth plummeting in March after a stronger-than-expected January and February.
""The measures ... to contain the spread of Covid-19 beginning in March ... significantly impacted education, trade, transport, restaurants and hotels, among others,"" the bank said in a statement accompanying the results.
Mining activity remained a bright spot, growing 5.1% despite the global downturn in prices and demand for copper. Most of Chile´s mines have continued to operate with reduced staff, and output has remained largely unaffected.
Domestic demand, however, plunged 2.6%, the bank said, as consumers retreated to their homes as the virus spread in March.

Chile surpassed 40,000 cases of the new coronavirus last week amid a sharp spike in infections that has seen hospitals approach collapse in the weeks ahead of the southern hemisphere winter.

The IHS Markit Household Finance Index rose in May to 37.8 from a 34.9 in April, which was its lowest in more than eight years.
""The financial toll of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequent public health measures has been heavy, with recent survey data showing unparalleled declines in workplace activity and incomes from employment,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
""It is also disconcerting to see so many survey respondents indicating concern towards job security, which could have a significant impact on consumer spending if the negative economic impact of the pandemic is protracted.""
Household incomes from employment fell at the sharpest rate since the series began in February 2009.
Despite this, Hayes said there appeared to be little sign of increased stress on household budgets, possibly reflecting a record fall in spending that was most widespread amongst those in the highest income brackets.
The Bank of England expects the economy to contract by around a quarter during the three months to June, and for there to be the biggest full-year fall in output in more than three centuries.
According to official figures, Britain's economy shrank by a record 6% in March, when a widespread lockdown began only towards the end of the month.

The IHS Markit data was based on a survey of 1,500 people by polling company Ipsos MORI conducted between May 7 and May 10.

727,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",Japan braces for worst postwar slump as pandemic tips economy into recession,"By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years in the last quarter, putting the nation on course for its deepest postwar slump as the coronavirus crisis ravages businesses and consumers.
Monday's first-quarter GDP data underlined the broadening impact of the outbreak, with exports plunging the most since the devastating March 2011 earthquake as global lockdowns and supply chain disruptions hit shipments of Japanese goods.
Analysts warn of an even bleaker picture for the current quarter as consumption crumbled after the government in April requested citizens to stay home and businesses to close, intensifying the challenge for policymakers battling a once-in-a-century pandemic.
""It's near certainty the economy suffered an even deeper decline in the current quarter,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute. ""Japan has entered a full-blown recession.""
The world's third-largest economy contracted an annualised 3.4% in the first quarter, preliminary official gross domestic product (GDP) data showed, less than a median market forecast for a 4.6% drop.
The slump came on top of an even steeper 7.3% fall in the October-December period, with the consecutive quarters of contraction meeting the technical definition of a recession. Japan last suffered recession in the second half of 2015.
The coronavirus, which first emerged in China late last year, has ravaged the global economy as many nations went into strict lockdowns to curb the outbreak that has so far killed over 310,000 people worldwide. The pandemic has been massively disruptive on supply chains and businesses, particularly in trade-reliant nations such as Japan. 
Indeed, the fallout of the virus on corporate Japan was telling with exports diving 6.0% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since April-June 2011.
""Exports to China began to fall in February, followed by a wave of slumping shipments to Europe and the United States,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Exports were also hurt by slumping inbound tourism,"" which counts as a drop in non-residents' purchases of Japanese services, he said.
DEEPER SLUMP, SLOWER RECOVERY
The shakeout in global trade was underlined in recent March data, with exports shrinking the most in nearly four years due to plunging U.S.-bound shipments.
Even the nation's major globe-trotting manufacturers weren't spared the pandemic's sweeping impact.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) has said it will cut domestic vehicle production by 122,000 units in June and expects an 80% drop in full-year operating profit.
The gloom in Japan is expected to deepen over coming months.
Analysts polled by Reuters estimate Japan's economy will shrink an annualised 22.0% in the current quarter, which would be a record decline, with pressure on output intensifying after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in April declared a nationwide state of emergency amid the widening pandemic.
The emergency was lifted for most regions on Thursday, but remained in effect for some big cities including Tokyo. Japan has so far reported 16,337 coronavirus cases and 756 deaths.
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Japan's $5 trillion economy, slipped 0.7% in January-March, less than a market forecast for a 1.6% drop, as robust demand for daily necessities partially offset the impact on services spending.
All the same, it marked the second straight quarter of decline, as households endured the double-whammy of the coronavirus and a sales tax hike to 10% from 8% in October last year.
Capital expenditure fell 0.5% in the first quarter after plummeting 4.8% in October-December last year, the GDP data showed, suggesting that uncertainty over the outlook is discouraging companies from boosting spending.
Taken together, domestic demand knocked 0.7 percentage point off GDP growth, while external demand shed 0.2 point.
All of this has put a strain on the labour market. The jobless rate in March rose to its highest in a year, while job availability slipped to a more than three-year low.
The government has already announced a record $1.1 trillion stimulus package, and the Bank of Japan expanded stimulus for the second straight month in April. Abe has pledged a second supplementary budget later this month to fund fresh spending measures to cushion the economic blow from the outbreak.
Still, many analysts warn that government support will come too little, too late.
""As always in Japan, the implementation is very slow. It will take the later half of the second quarter (and) the third quarter"" for government stimulus to kick in, said Martin Schulz, chief economist at Fujitsu.

""The recovery will be slower than many are hoping for ... To recover from this crisis, it will take about two years at least.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy contracted at its sharpest pace in eight years in the first quarter but by less than expected, as the coronavirius pandemic hit tourism and domestic activity.
The state planning agency, reporting January-March data on Monday, slashed its forecast for 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) to a contraction of 5.0-6.0% from growth of 1.5%-2.5% projected in February. 
That would be the worst decline since 1998 when the Asian financial crisis damaged the economy.
The agency also cut its projection for this year's exports and foreign tourist numbers, the main drivers of Thai growth.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy shrank 1.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, the deepest contraction since the fourth quarter of 2011, when there was bad flooding.
That was better than a 4.0% contraction seen in a Reuters poll, and compared with downwardly revised 1.5% growth in the final quarter of 2019.
On a quarterly basis, the economy shrank a seasonally adjusted 2.2%, also smaller than the poll's 4.5% decline.
The agency revised October-December's quarterly GDP to a 0.2 contraction from 0.2% growth, meaning the economy slipped into a technical recession.
The economy will be hit the hardest in the second quarter by lockdowns, before gradually recovering, Secretary General of the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) Thosaporn Sirisumphand told a news briefing.
Most economists expect the central bank to cut its key interest rate further from a record low of 0.75% at its next meeting on Wednesday to help support the economy.
Thailand's economy is heavily reliant on global trade and tourism, which has taken a hit from the pandemic that has infected more than 4 million people globally.

Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.5% in April from the prior month, following a 0.1% increase in March, Reuters calculated based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data.
On an annual basis, home prices picked up 5.1% in April, compared with March's 5.3% rise.
""Pent-up housing demand is being further released in April as the economy and life continue to get back on track,"" an official with the NBS said in a statement along with the data.
The stronger home prices are in line with recovery signs for real estate developers, who in April saw quickened investment and a narrower decline in sales.
Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS reported monthly price increases for new homes, with the number rising sharply to 50 from 38 in March. 
Nanjing, the capital city of eastern Jiangsu province, and Tangshan, in the northern Hebei province, were the top price performers last month, notching up a monthly price increase of 1.8%. 
Prices were lower in Wuhan city，the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, NBS data showed.

Gross domestic product will contract by an annualized 45% in the second quarter from the prior three months, compared with Goldman’s previous forecast of a 20% slump. A stronger rebound of 20% is now seen for the third quarter, while projections for the fourth quarter and first of next year are unchanged at 14% and 6.5%.
Those estimates imply that real GDP will fall by 5% in the 2021 fiscal year, which would be deeper than any other recession India has ever experienced, Goldman economists Prachi Mishra and Andrew Tilton wrote in a note dated May 17.
India’s government has extended its nationwide lockdown until May 31, while further easing restrictions in certain sectors to boost economic activity, as coronavirus cases escalate across the country. The announcement followed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s fifth briefing in as many days, in which she outlined details of the country’s $265 billion virus rescue package, which is equivalent to 10% of India’s GDP.
India Turns to Reforms to Keep Virus From Sinking Its Economy
“There have been a series of structural reform announcements across several sectors over the past few days,” the Goldman economists wrote. “These reforms are more medium-term in nature, and we therefore do not expect these to have an immediate impact on reviving growth. We will continue to monitor their implementation to gauge their effect on the medium-term outlook.”

But fewer than one in ten of the top fifth of earners had been affected, with only 6% furloughed and 3% losing their jobs.
Under the government's emergency coronavirus wage subsidy scheme, workers who are temporarily laid off continue to receive 80% of their pay, up to 2,500 pounds ($3,032) a month.
Saturday's survey showed 21% of private sector workers had been furloughed from their main job in early May.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's wholesale prices declined at the fastest annual pace in nearly four years in April, adding to fears the country may slip back into deflation as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on the world's third-largest economy.
While falling raw material costs could offer some relief for retailers whose sales have been hit by the health crisis, it will likely push consumer inflation further away from the Bank of Japan's elusive 2% target.

It was the biggest decline since November 2016 and followed a 0.4% fall in March, with the decline blamed mostly on slumping oil and nonferrous metal costs, the data showed.
Domestic final goods prices, which loosely track the consumer price index, fell 2.5 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.
Japan's economy is on the cusp of a deep recession as the pandemic has paralyzes business activity and global trade. The country has reported close to 16,000 coronavirus infections and over 650 deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Layoffs in the United States jumped to a record high in March, while the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs dropped to a 4-1/2-year low as the novel coronavirus crisis rapidly changed labor market dynamics.
The Labor Department said on Friday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, that layoffs and discharges increased 9.5 million in March to 11.4 million, the highest since the government started tracking the series in 2000. In just over a month, the labor market has shifted from one of worker shortages to the worst since the Great Depression.
Nonessential businesses shuttered in mid-March in the fight to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. Though many are gradually reopening, economists predict it would take years for the labor market and the broader economy to heal. The government reported last Friday that the economy lost a staggering 20.5 million jobs in April, the deepest plunge in payrolls since the Great Depression.
""Latest JOLTS data further illustrates the catastrophic COVID-19 labor market,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which compiles the report said data collection was affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The BLS said it modified the JOLTS estimates for March to better reflect the impact of the virus.
Layoffs and discharges were led by the accommodation and food services industry, with 4.1 million workers getting pink slips. In the retail sector, 908,000 workers lost their jobs. 
The layoffs and discharge rate surged to a record 7.5% in March from 1.2% in February. 
The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs dropped 654,000 to 2.78 million, the lowest since September 2015. The quits rates, which is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, dropped to 1.8%. That was the lowest since December 2014 and was down from 2.3% in February.
The government also reported that job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 813,000 to 6.19 million on the last business day of March. That was the lowest since May 2017. Vacancies peaked at 7.52 million in January 2019. 
The drop in job openings was led by sharp declines in vacancies in the accommodation and food services industry and manufacturing. The job openings rate fell to 3.9% in March from 4.4% in February.
Hiring decreased 658,000 to 5.2 million in March. The hiring rate fell to 3.4% from 3.8% in February.

738,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer sentiment edges up in May but worries about social isolation grow,"(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment rose unexpectedly in early May after a record plunge a month earlier as emergency assistance payments improved household finances hurt by mass layoffs from the coronavirus crisis, a survey released on Friday showed.
The University of Michigan's preliminary reading of its twice-monthly consumer sentiment survey also found that worries about social isolation from widespread stay-at-home orders imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 are growing as a major concern about the pandemic.
The survey's overall index on consumer sentiment edged up to 73.7 from an eight-year low of 71.8 in April when closures of non-essential businesses led to unprecedented job losses. April's fall was the largest in survey history.
May's reading was above the median forecast of 68 among economists polled by Reuters.
""Despite these gains, personal financial prospects for the year ahead continued to weaken, falling to the lowest level in almost six years, with declines especially sharp among upper income households,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose, while the expectations index dropped to the lowest in more than six years.
For a second month, the survey sought consumers' opinions on their greatest concerns arising from the pandemic: the threat to their health; the required social isolation; or the impact on family finances.
In May's preliminary survey, health remained the top concern at 57%, although down somewhat from 61% in April. Meanwhile, concern about social isolation rose to become the No. 2 major concern, with 21% of respondents labeling it their top worry versus just 14% a month last month.
Those identifying finances as their top concern slid to 17% from 22%.
""The original hypothesis was that as their primary concerns shifted from health to finances, consumers would become less accepting of constraints on reopening the economy,"" Curtin said.
""While these shifts were quite small, they indicate the growing costs of social isolation and its potential to shift opinions about reopening the economy.""

A number of U.S. states have moved to reopen some parts of their economies this month, and pressure is growing on several state governors to accelerate the process in the face of massive job losses. Since mid-March, more than 36 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that business inventories slipped 0.2% in March after dropping 0.5% in February. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. March's decline in business stocks was in line with economists' expectations.
Retail inventories increased 1.0% in March, instead of rising 0.9% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.3% fall in February.
Motor vehicle inventories rose 4.8% rather than surging 5.1% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, fell 1.0% and not the 1.3% decline as reported last month.
Goods imports decreased in March to their lowest since August 2017, the government reported last week. A drawdown of inventories contributed to gross domestic product declining at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, the sharpest pace of contraction since the 2007-09 Great Recession.
Wholesale inventories dropped 0.8% in March. Stocks at manufacturers also fell 0.8% in March.

Business sales tumbled 5.2% in March after falling 0.5% in the prior month. At March's sales pace, it would take 1.45 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.38 months in February.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian investors divested a record-breaking C$42.2 billion ($30 billion) in foreign securities in March amid heightened market volatility caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday.
Canadian investors sold C$29.3 billion in U.S shares, by far the largest since data have been compiled, Statscan said, noting investors also sold off C$11.5 billion in foreign bonds in March, with nearly half in U.S. Treasury bonds.
The previous record for Canadian sales of foreign securities was C$15.5 billion in January 2016.
Global stock and capital markets began to show higher volatility in late February, the agency said, as the global COVID-19 crisis intensified.
That volatility, which in Canada was marked by the start of a severe decline in stock prices and government bond yields in the last few days of February, extended to March, Statscan said, as officials shuttered non-essential businesses and urged people to stay home to slow the spread of the virus.
The S&P 500 (SPX) plunged to its lowest in more than three years in March, down as much as 35.4% from a record high in the previous month.
Meanwhile, foreign investors also reduced their exposure to Canadian securities in March by C$9.8 billion, largely on sales of shares.
Foreign investors sold C$6.1 billion in Canadian shares in March, with the banking and energy and mining sectors the largest contributors to the foreign divestment seen in the month, the agency said.
Canadian stock prices declined 17.7% in March, but have been trending upwards since the end of that month, Statscan said.

The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index rose 1.9 points from an eight-year low to 73.7, according to data Friday. That compared with the median estimate for a decline to 68 in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The measure of current conditions rose 8.7 points to 83, while the expectations index fell 2.4 points to 67.7, the lowest level since 2013.
“Confidence inched upward in early May as the CARES relief checks improved consumers’ finances and widespread price discounting boosted their buying attitudes,” Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement. “Despite these gains, personal financial prospects for the year ahead continued to weaken.”
A separate report Friday showed retail sales plunged in April by the most on record.
The Michigan report said the improvement in buying conditions for durable goods reflected deep discounts, especially on autos, as well as low interest rates. That helped offset concerns about job and income prospects.
A measure of sentiment on respondents’ current financial situations improved from the prior month due to income gains. But personal financial prospects for the year ahead were the lowest in almost six years.
Although some items are being heavily discounted, prices have been rising for everyday essentials such as food. The Michigan report showed inflation expectations for the year ahead jumped to 3%, the highest since 2018.
Asked about their top concerns related to the pandemic, 57% of respondents cited health, down slightly from 61% the prior month, while 17% said finances and 21% said social isolation. That indicates the “growing costs of social isolation and its potential to shift opinions about reopening the economy,” Curtin said.
While a number of states are beginning to let businesses reopen, it’s unclear how much confidence will rise in the near term. Economists expect a significant pick-up in activity in the third quarter, but a return to normal is still nowhere in sight as tens of millions of Americans are now out of work and schools remain closed.
The survey was conducted April 22 to May 13. During that period, the Labor Department reported that more than 20 million people lost their jobs, sending the unemployment rate to its highest since the Great Depression era.
The Michigan report also showed a wide partisan gap in confidence persisting between Democrats and Republicans, though the difference has narrowed since the pandemic started.

Investing.com -- Lockdowns across the U.S. led retail sales to their deepest monthly fall on record in April, new data published on Friday showed.
The Census Bureau said that retail sales fell by 16.4%, after a drop of 8.4% in March. That is considerably worse than the 12% fall expected by analysts ahead of time. The March drop was a tad less steep than the  initial estimate of 8.7%.
Core retail sales, which strip out auto sales, also fell by a record-breaking 17.2%, compared to expectations for a decline of only 8.6%.
The figures illustrated the sharp decline in fortunes between online retailers and those tied to their physical stores. Non-store retail volumes rose 8.4% on the month. 
The figures are the latest hard data generated for the first month to show the full impact of lockdowns that were imposed as the coronavirus pandemic spread across the U.S.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory output rose for the first time this year as the world's second-largest economy slowly emerged from its coronavirus lockdown, although consumption remained depressed amid increased job losses.
Industrial production climbed 3.9% in April from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, faster than the 1.5% increase forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts and following a 1.1% fall in March.
After months of lockdowns, China is reopening its economy as the outbreak on the mainland comes under control. The production of oil, coal, metals and electricity all increased as plants restarted operations in April.
However, China continues to face major challenges in its services sector, particularly retail, and as the pandemic sweeps the rest of the globe, affecting other major economies and trading partners.
Of particular concern for policymakers ahead of next week's annual meeting of parliament is the prospect of a spike in unemployment, which poses significant political risks for the nation of 1.4 billion.
""Overall, this set of data shows only small and gradual improvements in economic activity, which could upset markets as China is seen as the 'first out' economy from COVID-19,"" said Iris Pang, Chief Economist for Greater China at ING.
China's economy shrank for the first time since at least 1992 in the first quarter, as restrictions to curb the spread of the virus shut down factories and shopping malls.
Although much of the economy has reopened, many manufacturers are struggling with reduced or cancelled overseas orders as global demand falters. Earlier this week, data showed producer prices falling at their sharpest pace in four years, as industrial demand weakened.
While exports unexpectedly rose in April, driven in part by demand for medical supplies, imports saw a sharper-than-expected dive, signalling weak domestic demand.
More telling was a collapse in export orders seen in various factory surveys for April, which has significant implications for the industrial sector, a major employer in China.
Liu Aihua, a spokeswoman for the National Statistics Bureau, said unemployment pressure remained ""relatively big"". 
China's surveyed unemployment rate for April was 6.0%, slightly higher than the previous month.
Of greater focus are China's migrant workers, who are a significant part of the workforce and often not counted in official data.
Liu said the number of migrant workers who had returned to their cities of employment from their home towns in April was at 90% of levels seen in previous years.
However, Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics, said that figure is probably closer to 80%, suggesting true unemployment is double the official rate.
SOGGY CONSUMPTION
Those unemployment pressures are likely to strain household finances and drag on consumption.
Consumer spending remained weak in April with retail sales falling 7.5%, faster than the forecast 7.0% decline and extending the tumble in the first three months of the year as shops and restaurants across the country closed.
Fixed-asset investment fell 10.3% in January-April, compared with a forecast 10.0% fall and a 16.1% decline in January-March.
Private sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for 60% of total investment, fell 13.3% in January-April, compared with an 18.8% decline in the first three months of the year.
China's property sector, however, showed some resilience with real estate investment quickening in April while property sales fell at a much slower pace, providing some relief for authorities.
Facing an uphill battle to revive growth, legislators are expected to unveil fresh stimulus measures to spur domestic demand at the annual parliament next week.

""Policymakers have signalled that further stimulus is in the pipeline, which should continue to boost infrastructure construction and industrial output,"" said Evans-Pritchard. ""But the recovery in consumption and service sector activity is likely to remain more drawn out.""

But some businesses are unsure what health and safety measures they are required to take, in addition to facing a broader slump in demand.

748,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 01:59PM ET</span>","Second layoffs, backlogs wave keeps U.S. jobless claims sky high","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The novel coronavirus crisis continues to pummel the U.S. labor market, with the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits falling less than expected last week, suggesting a second wave of layoffs in industries and jobs not initially impacted by business closures caused by the pandemic.
The Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, supports economists' contention that it would take a while for activity to rebound even as businesses in many states reopen after shuttering in mid-March as authorities tried to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday warned of an ""extended period"" of weak growth and stagnant incomes. The economy lost a staggering 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge in payrolls since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Economic output dropped in the first quarter at its sharpest rate since the 2007-09 Great Recession.
""Unemployment claims still show continuing devastation for American families,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The predicted 'second wave' of layoffs may have started. This is more layoffs building on the initial layoffs, as middle management and those in support industries lose their jobs.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 2.981 million for the week ended May 9, the government said. While that was down from 3.176 million in the prior week and marked the sixth straight weekly drop, claims remain astoundingly high.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast applications for unemployment benefits totaling 2.5 million in the latest week. Claims have been gradually decreasing since hitting a record 6.867 million in the week ended March 28.
In addition to weak demand causing layoffs in industries and jobs not initially affected by the coronavirus shutdowns, the processing of application backlogs, which accumulated as state unemployment offices were overwhelmed by the unprecedented wave of applications, was keeping claims elevated, economists said.
They said some workers were likely filing more than one claim.
States continue to report layoffs in the accommodation and food services, healthcare and social assistance industries among other. They are also reporting redundancies in the professional, scientific, technical services and education industries. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower as investors worried about the possibility of prolonged economic weakness and as President Donald Trump's rhetoric on China's role in the coronavirus pandemic renewed fears over Sino-U.S. trade relations. The dollar was higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
The latest numbers lifted to 36.5 million the number of people who have filed claims for unemployment benefits since mid-March, or more than one in five workers losing their job. Claims will be closely watched in the coming weeks for signs whether companies rehire workers as businesses reopen.
Though many parts of the country are reopening, businesses and factories are operating well below capacity. Unadjusted claims for Florida and Georgia, which have led the easing of restrictions on businesses, increased last week. 
While some businesses have accessed loans from an almost $3 trillion fiscal package, which could be partially forgiven if they use the credit for employee salaries, many small enterprises are expected to close permanently, leaving some of the 21.4 million people who lost their jobs in March and April out of work for a long time.
""Jobless claims pour cold water on the V-shaped recovery talk,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Economic growth might get a boost from pent-up demand, but the labor markets have dug themselves a deeper hole that will be harder to climb back out of.""
But there is some cautious optimism. Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased only 456,000 to a record 22.833 million for the week ending May 2. The so-called continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag and remains well below the cumulative number of initial claims. Some economists view it as a better gauge of the labor market's health.
""The gap between the two series is somewhat strange,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Not everyone will qualify for unemployment benefits and there may well be the case of double counting on initial claims as people try to register both online and by phone. There could also be issues with backlogs between filing and receiving benefits and then being classified as a continuing claimant.""
Economists believe April marked the trough in job losses and expect May payrolls to drop at least 15 million.
The Labor Department also reported that 3.4 million people had their applications for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) processed in the week ending April 25. 

The PUA program covers gig workers and many others who do not qualify for regular insurance unemployment, but have been forced out of work because of COVID-19.

The Labor Department said on Thursday import prices dropped 2.6% last month, the largest decline since January 2015, after a revised 2.4% decline in March.
Import prices, which exclude tariffs, were previously reported to have decreased 2.3% in March.
Economists polled by Reuters had seen import prices plunging 3.1% in April. In the 12 months through April, import prices tumbled 6.8%. That was the largest decrease since December 2015 and followed a 4.2% decline in March.
The report followed data this week showing the biggest drop in the consumer price index since the Great Recession in April. Producer prices fell by the most since 2009 last month.

Lockdowns to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, have weighed on domestic and global demand. That has raised the specter of deflation, a decline in the general price level, which is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices, worsening the economic downturn.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits totaled 2.98 million in the week ending May 9, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday, the smallest number since March but still far from signaling any meaningful turnaround in the labor market.
While it was higher than forecasts of 2.5 million, it was down from 3.17 million in the prior week. Claims have been gradually decreasing since hitting a record 6.86 million in the week ended March 28.
The data underlines economists' expectations for a third straight month of massive job losses in May and comes a day after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned of an ""extended period"" of weak growth and stagnant incomes as the coronavirus pandemic continues to batter the economy.
Powell noted that the job losses were hitting lower-paid segments of the workforce hardest.
The latest filings bring the total number of people who applied for unemployment benefits to about 36.5 million since March 21, nearly a quarter of the working age population. 
The economy lost a staggering 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge in payrolls since the Great Depression of the 1930s, as businesses were locked down to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.
""We are on the back end of the first wave of layoffs, but now we are transitioning from the natural-disaster phase to the recession phase,"" said Josh Wright, chief economist at Wrightside Advisors in New York. ""That's why so many white collar jobs are still being lost. We effectively amputated a large section of the economy, and we are going to limp along afterwards.""
Continuing claims, which show the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased to a new record of 22.83 million in the week ended May 2, the report said, up from 22.37 million a week earlier.
Continuing claims data is reported with a one-week delay.
""We would expect a peak should arrive sometime in late May or June, with continuing claims falling as rehiring resumes,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York. ""The speed of the decline will indicate how fast rehiring is occurring.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned citizens to brace for more bad news as data released on Thursday showed the country's monthly job losses rose to a record high because of coronavirus lockdown measures.
The unprecedented employment data provided a stark illustration of the pandemic's effect on the national economy, which had experienced an unbroken run of growth for more than two decades.
Compounding concerns about the economic hit is a diplomatic spat with China, Australia's largest trading partner, sparked by Morrison's call for an international inquiry into the origins of the new coronavirus.
""This is a tough day for Australia, a very tough day,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a televised media briefing. ""Terribly shocking, although not unexpected.""
The Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed 594,300 jobs were lost in April, the largest fall on record, underscoring Morrison's decision to slowly begin reopening the country. The unemployment rate shot up to 6.2%, the highest since September 2015, from 5.2% in March.
That was lower than the 8.3% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, largely due to a significant decline in the number of people looking for work, including some people who are receiving an emergency ""jobseeker"" payment from the government. 
If those people were included, the statistics office said, the unemployment rate would spike to 9.6%, the highest since 1997.
""The terms ‘unprecedented’ and ‘extraordinary’ are used regularly to describe the effects of COVID-19 on the economy but when discussing the impact on the job market, the terms are appropriate,"" said Craig James, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY).
Australia imposed strict social distancing measures in March to tackle the pandemic, closing its borders to all non-citizens and ordering people to stay home unless on essential business. Pubs, sports centres, libraries and other public buildings were closed while cafes and restaurants were restricted to takeaway services. 
Many shops and other businesses not explicitly ordered to close did so anyway in response to a drop in demand as people stayed home.
Officials have credited the lockdown measures with constraining the spread of the virus. Australia has recorded about 7,000 COVID-19 cases, including 98 deaths, significantly below the levels reported in North America and Europe.
New South Wales and Victoria, Australia's two most populous states, on Thursday reported just 13 new cases between them, including infections linked to an outbreak at a meat factory and a McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) restaurant.
CHINA SPAT
Morrison on Thursday stressed the need to move ahead with his government's three-step plan to remove all social distancing restrictions by July, a program that Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has said would increase gross domestic product by A$9.4 billion each month..
Reopening the economy has been partly overshadowed, however, by a row with China, which took around 38% of all Australia's exports last year, over Australia's push for the coronavirus inquiry.
China earlier this week suspended the export licences of several of Australia's largest beef processors and proposed tariffs of 80% on Australian barley shipments, actions viewed as retaliatory following a warning by Chinese ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye that Chinese consumers could boycott Australian products.
Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham has tried to smooth the waters, saying the beef ban was linked to labelling issues while the barley tariffs were related to an anti-dumping case, but acknowledged on Thursday that his Chinese counterpart had not responded to requests for a meeting.
Back home, the rescue of Virgin Australia, the country's second largest airline, became a political issue as Queensland's state government outed itself as one of the 19 potential bidders for the struggling carrier. Virgin entered voluntary administration in April and indicative offers for the company are due on Friday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian jobs plunged by the most on record in April as employers laid off hundreds of thousands of staff in response to the economy-wide shutdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed employment in April decreased 594,300, the largest fall on record.
The unemployment rate shot up to 6.2%, the highest since September 2015, from 5.2% in March but lower than the 8.3% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
The main reason unemployment did not fall as much as expected was the significant decline in the number of people looking for work, which meant fewer people than expected were counted among the unemployed.
As a result, the participation rate fell 2.4 percentage points to 63.5% from April, the lowest since 2004 and well below the 65.2% forecast.
""The unemployment rate rose far less than most had anticipated in April, but that masks a sharp fall in employment and we still expect the unemployment rate to rise further over the coming months,"" Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics wrote in a note.
The data is the first official estimate of unemployment in Australia since the COVID-19-related mobility restrictions forced business to down shutters since late March.
The figures come as Australia's central bank predicted the country's gross domestic product (GDP) could shrink by 10% in the first half of the year with unemployment hitting 10% by June and staying elevated through 2021.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has gone all-in by cutting rates to a record low of 0.25%, flooding the financial system with cash and even buying government bonds to lower borrowing rates for business.
Additionally, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pledged spending worth more than 10% of GDP, including a A$130 billion subsidy to employers to keep staff they might otherwise have let go.
The ABS data showed underemployment, or the number of people already working but looking for more hours, spiked 4.9 percentage points to 13.7%.
Hours worked reduced by 9.2% between March and April in seasonally adjusted terms, double the decrease in employed people, the data showed.
The ABS estimates that a combined group of 2.7 million people were affected by either job loss or having their hours reduced for economic reasons between March and April.
This group was much larger than the number of people who gained employment or worked increased hours between March and April, underpinning the net results.
Economists say the labour market is unlikely to improve rapidly even though parts of Australia's economy are now re-opening with the rate of growth in new infections having slowed to around 0.1%.
The ""reopening will be a gradual process and not everyone who lost their job during the lockdown will immediately find a new one,"" Thielant said.

The dire Australian numbers follow those in the United states, which showed 20.5 million jobs lost in April, and the unemployment rate rising to 14.7%. The true U.S. unemployment rate may be closer to 19.5%, the government had said in a note attached to its report.

755,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",UK surveyors expect price falls when housing market reopens,"LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices are likely to fall as the market slowly begins to reopen, after a collapse in activity due to COVID-19 restrictions last month, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors welcomed moves by the government this week to try to get the market going again but said, on average, its members expected prices would only recover their pre-lockdown levels in 11 months' time.
Eighty percent of Britain's property surveyors said they had seen buyers and sellers pull out of transactions in April as the coronavirus lockdown effectively closed the housing market.
""Not surprisingly, the latest survey shows that housing activity indicators collapsed in April reflecting the impact of the lockdown,"" Simon Rubinsohn, RICS' chief economist, said.
""Looking further out, there is a little more optimism but the numbers still suggest that it will be a struggle to get confidence back to where it was as recently as February.""
RICS' headline house price balance plunged in April to -21 from +9 in March. Three quarters of surveyors expected prices to fall when the market reopened, with 40% predicting a drop of more than 4%.
New instructions to sell a property in April slumped by the most since the survey began in 1999.
Buyers and renters in England were given the go-ahead to move house again by the government on Wednesday when estate agents' offices reopened and buyers and renters were allowed to able to view properties in person among other changes.
Nearly two-thirds of the surveyors polled by RICS said a temporary suspension of Britain's stamp duty tax on property purchases would help the market recover after the lockdown.

The Labor's Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which compiles the closely followed monthly employment report, also raised March's job losses to show nonfarm payrolls decreasing 881,000 instead of 870,000 as previously estimated. 
Employment gains for February were revised up to 251,000 from 230,000 as previously reported. 
Nonfarm payrolls are calculated from a survey of establishments.
""On May 11, 2020, BLS corrected errors in national estimates for seasonally adjusted all employees in professional and technical services, professional and business services, private service-providing, service-providing, total private, and total nonfarm,"" the Labor Department said in a statement on its website. ""The corrected change in total nonfarm employment for April is 37,000 lower than initially reported.""

There was no impact on the unemployment rate, which is drawn from a separate survey of households. The unemployment rate jumped to 14.7% in April, a post-World War Two record, from 4.4% in March.

757,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices record largest drop since 2009 as coronavirus suppresses demand,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell by the most since 2009 in April, leading to the largest annual decline in nearly 4-1/2 years, bolstering some economists' predictions for a brief period of deflation as the novel coronavirus depresses demand.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday followed data on Tuesday showing consumer prices dropping by the most since the 2007-09 Great Recession, and a measure of underlying inflation posting a record decline. It also came as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned the economy could face an ""extended period"" of weak growth and stagnant incomes.
Lockdowns to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, have weighed on demand, with the economy contracting in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since the final three months of 2008. Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices, worsening the economic downturn.
""This is yet another stark evidence that the global coronavirus recession is having a strong disinflationary effect on the economy,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Looking ahead, the severe demand shock from the COVID-19, the collapse of oil prices and the stronger dollar will continue to exert strong deflationary pressure on prices.""
The producer price index for final demand tumbled 1.3% last month, the biggest decline since the series was revamped in December 2009, after slipping 0.2% in March. In the 12 months through April, the PPI decreased 1.2%. That was the biggest drop since November 2015 and followed a 0.7% increase in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI falling 0.5% in April and declining 0.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as investors digested Powell's comments in a webcast question & answer hosted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading marginally higher.
BROAD PRICE WEAKNESS
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices plunged 0.9% in April, the biggest drop since the introduction of the series in September 2013. 
The so-called core PPI fell 0.2% in March and has now declined for three straight months. In the 12 months through April, the core PPI decreased 0.3%. That was the first 12-month drop in core PPI and followed a 1.0% increase in March. 
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.7% year-on-year in March after rising 1.8% in February. April's core PCE price index data will be released at the end of the month.
In April, wholesale energy prices collapsed 19.0% after tumbling 6.7% in March. They were depressed by a 56.6% dive in gasoline prices, the largest decrease since the series began in February 1947. That followed a 16.8% drop in March. 
Gasoline accounted for two-thirds of the decrease in the cost of goods last month. Goods prices fell 3.3% in April, the largest decline since the series was revamped in December 2009, after declining 1.0% in the prior month. Wholesale food prices dropped 0.5% last month after being unchanged in March.
The decline in wholesale food prices was in stark contrast to the surge in food prices at the consumer level last month, which rose at the fastest pace since January 1990, consumer price data showed on Tuesday.
The sharp drop in wholesale goods prices accounted for more than 80% of the decrease in the PPI last month. Core goods prices fell 0.4% in April after gaining 0.2% in March.
""Factory production is falling and bringing down the prices of producer goods,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Inflation isn't coming back in this economy for a long, long time. These are the worst of times for many manufacturers and it will take years for strengthening demand to bring them back to full capacity."" 
The cost of services fell 0.2% last month, reversing March's 0.2% gain. Services were held down by decreases in the costs of airline tickets and hotel and motel accommodation. Prices for apparel, footwear and accessories also fell.
The cost of healthcare services was unchanged in April for a second straight month. Portfolio management fees plummeted 12.0% last month after dropping 0.8% in March. Those healthcare, travel and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index. 
Taken together with other details from Tuesday's CPI report, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is forecasting the core PCE price index falling 0.4% in April and increasing 1.0% year-on-year. 

""This would be an unusually large monthly decline for the core index, but not quite the largest on record,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""There is greater-than-normal uncertainty for our core PCE tracking given that some of the categories with recent large price changes also likely have seen large changes in consumption volumes.""

Margins rose 1.4% in March. The cost of healthcare services was unchanged in April for a second straight month. Portfolio management fees plummeted 12.0% last month after dropping 0.8% in March. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index.

759,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",U.S. Producer Prices Fall From Year Ago by Most Since 2015,"(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers declined in April from a year earlier by the most since 2015, reflecting falling energy costs and signaling waning inflation pressures as the coronavirus curtailed demand.
The producer-price index dropped 1.2% after a 0.7% increase in the year through March, Labor Department figures showed Wednesday. Compared with the prior month, the PPI decreased 1.3% in April, the most in data back to 2009.
So-called core prices, which exclude food and energy, increased 0.6% in the year ended in April, the smallest annual gain since the end of 2015. Core costs fell 0.3% from a month earlier.
Diminishing price pressures along the production pipeline, due to weak global demand and slumping domestic sales as a result of efforts to contain the pandemic, will help limit inflation at the consumer level. A report Tuesday showed the core consumer-price index declined in April from the prior month by the most in records back to 1957.
The cost of goods fell 3.3% from a month earlier, the biggest decrease in data back to 2009. Two-thirds of the slide in goods prices reflected an almost 57% slump in gasoline, the largest decline in records back to February 1947.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- fell 0.9% from the prior month and 0.3% from a year earlier.

760,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>","UK GDP shrinks by record 5.8% in March, harder COVID hit ahead","By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank by a record 5.8% in March as the coronavirus crisis escalated and the government shut down much of the country, according to official data that point towards an even bigger hit to come.
The monthly drop in gross domestic product was felt in almost all sectors - from the country's shuttered restaurants and bars to its building sites and factories - and was the largest since comparable records began in 1997.
""The sharp contraction in UK Q1 GDP comes as little surprise, but does clearly highlight the magnitude of the challenge facing policymakers,"" JP Morgan market strategist Hugh Gimber said.
In the first three months of the year, GDP contracted by 2.0% from the last three months of 2019, the biggest drop since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008, the Office for National Statistics said.
The Bank of England said last week that the contraction of the economy in the April-June period could approach 25% and lead to the largest annual decline in more than three centuries.
British two-year government bond yields sank to a record low of -0.045% after the data, reinforcing expectations that the Bank of England will ramp up its record 645 billion pounds ($791 billion) of asset purchases next month.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said Britain was now in the midst of a significant recession. 
""We have to support people's jobs, their incomes, livelihoods at this time, and support businesses so we can get through this period of severe disruption and emerge stronger on the other side,"" he said after the GDP data. 
A newspaper said on Tuesday that finance ministry officials have warned Sunak the budget deficit could swell to a record 337 billion pounds this year from just 55 billion pounds forecast in March. 
On Tuesday, Britain's government extended a costly job support programme for another four months, though businesses will need to pick up more of the tab from August. 
DELAYED LOCKDOWN
The decline in first-quarter GDP was slightly smaller than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll, and less than the 3.8% slump suffered by the euro zone in the first quarter. But Britain only started its lockdown on March 23, later than many other euro zone countries.
COVID-19 has killed more than 40,000 people in the United Kingdom, the highest death toll reported in Europe so far.
Economists said output appeared to have fallen around a fifth after the lockdown came into force.
Separate data from the British Retail Consortium trade body showed retail spending dropped almost a fifth in April. Barclaycard said consumer spending had dropped more than a third.
Wednesday's ONS figures showed household consumption fell by 1.8% in the first quarter, the most since 2008.
The BoE said last week the economy could rebound if coronavirus restrictions are lifted, pencilling in a 15% recovery after a historic 14% fall in GDP for 2020 as a whole.
But it warned recovery might be slower, especially if consumers prove cautious about returning to their normal lives, a view shared by many economists.
""The UK's economic engine will be much harder to kickstart than it was to stall,"" Rabobank economist Stefan Koopman said.

""Talk of a V-shaped recovery feels like wishful thinking, and we expect prolonged periods of depressed growth across the majority of the economy. A flatter, U-shaped recovery is more likely,"" he said.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial production in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 11.3% month-on-month in March, the sharpest decline since records started in 1991, for a 12.9% year-on-year plunge.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 12.1% month-on-month decline and a 12.4% annual decrease.
Eurostat said production of durable consumer goods like cars, washing machines or television sets fell the most, tumbling 26.3% on the month and 24.2% year-on-year. 
The output of capital goods - used for investments - also fell sharply by 15.9% month-on-month and 21.5% year-on-year.
Non-durable consumer goods, like food, recorded the smallest fall of only 1.6% month-on-month and 0.8% year-on-year.

Germany, a big exporter of capital goods and durable consumer goods, saw its industrial production fall 14.2% year-on-year in March, while Ireland, a producer of food, reported a surprising 25.3 percent increase in industrial output.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment slumped to a record low in April, a Cabinet Office survey showed on Wednesday, pointing to intensifying pressure on the economy from the coronavirus-driven lockdown measures at home and worldwide.
The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions dropped to 7.9 from the previous all-time low of 14.2 in March.
That marked a nadir for the survey since seasonally-adjusted data became available in 2002.
The reading comes after a key economic indicator on Tuesday showed the fastest drop in nine years in March, backing other data during that month and in April that paint a darkening economic outlook.
The economy is likely to have already slipped into recession - two straight quarters of contraction - in the March quarter due to the worsening pandemic worldwide, following a slump in the final quarter of 2019, a Reuters poll showed.
Service sector businesses usually enjoy strong sales in April, which marks the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan and also sees the Golden Week holiday season starting near the end of the month.
But Wednesday's survey underscored the widespread damage inflicted by the lockdown measures to slow the virus spread, with household, corporate and employment activity components all falling to record lows, a Cabinet Office official said.
""We suspect that Japan's business surveys will recover somewhat in May as many regions start to loosen restrictions,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
""However, severe damage has already been done and the recovery won't be immediate. We are forecasting a 7% fall in GDP this year.""
While the government plans to lift the state of emergency for some prefectures that saw infection numbers stabilise, many big cities including Tokyo will likely retain current restrictions at least for the rest of this month.
The outlook index, which indicates the level of confidence in future conditions, dropped 2.2 points to a record low of 16.6 in April from 18.8 in March.
A survey reading above 50 indicates respondents think conditions are improving compared to three months earlier, while a reading below 50 indicates pessimism.
The index showed conditions were ""worsening further"" while already being ""extremely severe"" due to the impact from the coronavirus, the government said.
""Customer usage was extremely reduced due to the impact from the coronavirus, and our business went into a critical state,"" a taxi driver said, adding that he hoped supportive policy would be provided quickly.
""We think the novel coronavirus will lead to a crisis situation from now on,"" said a respondent from a clothing shop.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday said the government stood ready to take additional economic support measures, on top of the record $1.1 trillion stimulus package announced in April that focuses on cash payouts to households and loans to small businesses hurt by the pandemic.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's economy grew marginally in the first quarter, execeeding expectations, but will likely contract in April-June as the coronavirus pandemic hits exports and domestic demand.
Gross domestic product grew 0.7% in the first quarter from a year earlier, better than the 1.5% decline forecast in a Reuters poll, though still below the 3.6% growth rate in the fourth quarter.
Bank Negara Malaysia said the coronavirus outbreak had affected growth across major and regional economies, many of which imposed lockdowns that crimped economic activity and demand, including in Malaysia.
""The ongoing pandemic has created an unprecedented economic crisis,"" central bank Governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus told a virtual media conference.
Curbs on movement and businesses, which were imposed in mid-March to contain the spread of the virus and extended to June 9, will likely cause a decline in the economy this quarter before economic activity gradually improves in the second half of the year, the central bank said.
Southeast Asia's third-largest economy has taken a blow from sharp downturns in tourism and a drop in demand for its commodities such as palm oil, crude oil and natural gas. 
The economy continued to be propped up by private consumption, which grew 6.7% annually in the first quarter, but it may take a hit moving forward as BNM expects the pandemic to have a significant effect on the labour market.
Unemployment rose to 3.5% in January-March due to six weeks of strict social restrictions, from 3.2% the previous quarter, according to department of statistics data.
EXPORTS UNDER PRESSURE
Exports fell 4.7% in March when the curbs were introduced, sharply down from the 11.8% expansion from a month earlier.
This indicates that the government needs to speed up large-scale infrastructure projects and reopen the economy to mitigate the effects of weak external demand, said Bank Islam chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid.
""Assuming that COVID-19 infection rates remain under control, the government needs to accelerate infrastructure project implementation in order to kickstart the economy,"" Mohd Afzanizam told Reuters.
""However, they need to be mindful of the possible resurgence of new cases. It's a tough balancing act.""
Malaysia, which until mid-April had the highest number of reported coronavirus cases in Southeast Asia, has since relaxed some of the restrictions in a bid to jumpstart the economy.
BNM took aggressive preemptive moves earlier this year, slashing its overnight policy rate  by 100 basis points to a historic low of 2.00% and loosened liquidity rules to support the banking system.
Nor Shamsiah said the rate cuts would help reduce the debt burden of households and businesses and aid expansion going into the second half.
Any additional cuts this year will be based on prevailing economic and monetary conditions, she said.
Nor Shamsiah said the central bank was unable to provide a forecast for full-year 2020 growth due to the uncertainties tied to the pandemic.
The central bank in a statement predicted the economy would contract in the second quarter but economic activity was expected to gradually improve in the second half.
The central bank had in April forecast the economy to either shrink by as much as 2% or grow marginally by 0.5% this year.
Factory output also took a hit in March when it contracted 4.9%, its sharpest decline in nearly a decade.

BNM said average headline inflation will likely turn negative this year on substantially lower global oil prices. Consumer prices in March fell for the first time in more than a year, easing 0.2% due to cheaper pump prices.

The slump meant gross domestic product fell 2% in the first quarter, as restrictions to control the coronavirus heaped misery on an already tepid economy. The damage was done in March, when the the lockdown saw the dominant services industry shrink by 6.2%. Manufacturing contracted 4.6% and construction lost 5.9%.
With all-but essential businesses shuttered, Britain is now almost certainly in a deep recession. The Bank of England expects a strong rebound in 2021 after a 14% slump this year but many analysts regard such a scenario as overly optimistic.
In a sign of the challenges facing the economy, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Tuesday extended wage subsidies for furloughed workers until the end of October at a cost of billions of pounds to the public purse. Meanwhile, the Bank of England may need to ease monetary policy further to prop up the economy, Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said Tuesday.
The economy has now failed to grow for three of the previous four quarters, after months of political and Brexit uncertainty left the U.K. meant the U.K. entered the latest crisis on a weak footing.
Consumer spending, the engine of the economy, fell 1.7% in the first quarter, the largest drop since the financial crisis, while worse might be to come.
Separate reports Wednesday showed consumer spending has collapsed in recent weeks. The British Retail Consortium said its measure of sales fell 19.1% in April from a year earlier -- the worst since records began in 1995 -- while Barclaycard’s own gauge of transactions fell 36.5%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese bank lending jumped in April at the fastest annual pace in nearly three years, central bank data showed on Wednesday, reflecting a surge in fund demand from firms hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Analysts expect lending to continue rising as the government has asked commercial banks to offer low-interest loans to cash-strapped companies to help them weather the health crisis.
Outstanding loans held by the country's four main categories of banks, including ""shinkin"" or credit unions, stood at 553.486 trillion yen ($5.17 trillion) in April, up 3.0% from the previous year, according to data released by the Bank of Japan.
That was the biggest rise since August 2017 and an acceleration from a 2.0% increase in March.
The world's third-largest economy is on the cusp of a deep recession, as the pandemic forces households to stay home and businesses to shut down.
The BOJ ramped up stimulus for the second straight month in April, focusing on steps to ease corporate funding strains as slumping sales from the pandemic prodded many firms to hoard cash.
About 15,968 coronavirus infections and 657 deaths have been confirmed in Japan as of Tuesday, excluding cases from a cruise ship previously quarantined in Yokohama, according to NHK.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's unemployment rate was unchanged in April but the number of employed fell at its fastest in more than two decades, data showed on Wednesday, as efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic shut businesses and cut social activity.
The nation's unemployment rate was a seasonally adjusted 3.8% in April, unchanged from March.
However, the number of employed was 26.6 million in April, 476,000 fewer than a year earlier, for the worst plunge since February 1999, when the figure shrank 658,000, data from Statistics Korea showed.
Asia's fourth-largest economy could contract this year as global demand for Korean goods falls and jobs vanish across the service and manufacturing sectors, even as policymakers pump out stimulus to keep credit flowing to businesses. 
The government plans to inject more than 245 trillion won ($200.62 billion) of stimulus, or about 10% of GDP, to support businesses and keep more South Koreans in jobs through the pandemic. 
The economy faces a ""wartime situation"" with ""colossal"" damage from the pandemic, President Moon Jae-in said on Sunday, the third anniversary of his inauguration. 
""The employment shock is also growing as time passes,"" Moon added.
""Unemployment fears are spreading beyond self-employed small business owners, non-permanent workers and day labourers to affect almost all employees, including full-time employees and those at mid-market companies and large businesses.""
Breakdowns showed workers at retailers and restaurants were the hardest hit in April, as the numbers of new jobs fell 334,000 from a year earlier. 

After the data release, Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said the government plans to urgently create more than 550,000 jobs to protect self-employed businesses and those in temporary jobs.

The number of jobs fell by 476,000 from a year ago, data from the statistics office showed Wednesday. The unemployment rate held at 3.8%. Economists had forecast the rate rising to 4.1%.
A weakening labor market adds to growing challenges for South Korea’s economy. Exports are tumbling as overseas demand dwindles amid lockdowns for major trade partners. South Korea’s early success in containing the outbreak raised hopes for a swift rebound in consumption that might support the services sector, but that optimism is fading after a resurgence of virus cases this month.
The economy, which shrank 1.4% last quarter, is expected contract more sharply during the April-June period. South Korea’s daily exports plunged 30% on average in the first ten days of this month, underscoring the impact of the worsening pandemic.
‘Jobs for Life’ in South Korea and Japan to Cushion Virus Blow
The government has pledged more than 240 trillion won ($196 billion) in spending to shield the economy from the virus. The focus has been on helping businesses survive and maintain their workers, while families have been given cash handouts to spend at smaller stores.
Job losses were the heaviest among part-time and temporary workers while restaurant and hotel businesses saw the second biggest drop in employment, according to the statistics office.

The British Retail Consortium said its members reported a 19.1% drop in total sales last month compared with April last year, the biggest fall since it began its monthly index in 1995.
Barclaycard, part of  Barclays  Bank (L:BARC), said credit and debit card spending plunged by 36.5% compared with a year earlier as spending on travel, pubs and restaurants collapsed.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson shut down much of the economy and ordered people to stay largely at home in late March in an attempts to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
Last week the Bank of England said it was plausible that both consumer spending and broader economic output would fall by around a quarter during the three months to June, and that output for 2020 could suffer its biggest hit in over 300 years.
Over the three months to April, in-store sales of non-food items plunged by 36.0% while food sales over the period rose by 6.0% as consumers stocked up on essentials for the government's coronavirus shutdown, the BRC said. 
By contrast, online non-food sales leapt by nearly 60% in April to account for more than two thirds of non-food spending.
""As the lockdown wears on, these new shopping habits – such as the trend towards online purchases - will become more entrenched for many consumers,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Barclaycard said spending at pubs and restaurants had fallen by 97%, but supermarket sales were up by 14% and online spending on home improvements increased by 27%.

Almost nine in 10 adults have saved money on everyday expenses since the lockdown began but confidence in Britain's economy dropped to its lowest for at least six years with just 20% of adults feeling positive, it added.

770,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",U.S. reports record $738 billion budget deficit in April,"By Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday reported a record $738 billion budget deficit in April as an explosion in government spending and a shrinking of revenues amid the novel coronavirus pandemic pushed it deeply into the red.
The Treasury Department said the budget deficit in April was the first to reflect the enormity of government spending that has been authorized to try to mitigate the economic impact of the crisis. The previous record budget deficit for any month was $235 billion in February 2020. 
Until recently, most of the country was under strict lockdown orders and many businesses were shuttered to try to contain the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 80,000 people in the United States.
""They really are striking numbers that I didn't think I would ever see,"" a senior U.S. Treasury official told reporters when asked about the monthly budget figures.
The fiscal year-to-date deficit surged to $1.48 trillion compared to a $531 billion deficit in the comparable period in 2019, blasting past the previous monthly deficit record of $870 billion in April 2011.
The U.S. Congress approved a $2.3 trillion rescue package to deal with the crisis on March 27 and has since added to it, taking total emergency relief spending to help insulate individuals, families, businesses and state and local governments to around $3 trillion. 
April marked the first month some of those stimulus programs were begun to be paid. Roughly $600 billion in outlays for April were attributable to government spending on coronavirus relief measures, while receipts were reduced by about $300 billion by the crisis, the senior Treasury official estimated.
April is normally a month in which Treasury posts a surplus because tax payments are due on April 15, but they have been delayed this year until July 15 due to the pandemic. The government has only reported an April deficit 15 times over the past 66 years.
The primary reason for a reduction in receipts was the deferral of certain individual and business taxes from April, as well as changes to tax laws passed in recent legislation, Treasury said.
More than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since March 21, which equates to roughly one in five jobs. That has also cratered the U.S. government's revenue base.
In April, receipts totaled $242 billion, down 55% from a year earlier, while outlays surged 161% to $980 billion. 

About $283 billion in non-withheld individual income taxes were paid in April 2019, according to Treasury data, and receipts for taxes withheld from worker paychecks, which totaled $114 billion in April 2019, were reduced this year by the jump in unemployment.

771,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",Coronavirus crisis leads to largest U.S. consumer price decline since 2008,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices dropped by the most since the Great Recession in April, weighed down by a plunge in demand for gasoline and services including airline travel as Americans stayed home during the coronavirus crisis.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed a record decrease in underlying prices last month, raising the specter of a bout of deflation as the economy sinks deeper into a recession triggered by lockdowns to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. 
The government reported last Friday that the economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the deepest drop since the Great Depression. The economy contracted in the first quarter at its steepest pace since the 2007-09 downturn. 
Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
""The economic collapse has taken a dangerous turn where now it is consumer prices that are being pulled down into the abyss as consumers sitting at home have postponed their purchases,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Part of the reason the Great Depression lingered so long was because consumers knew they could wait till next year to buy cars and refrigerators and homes at a cheaper discount.""
The consumer price index tumbled 0.8% last month after falling 0.4% in March. That was the largest decline since December 2008 when the economy was in the throes of a recession, and marked the second straight monthly decrease in the CPI.
Gasoline prices plunged 20.6%, the largest decrease since November 2008, after tumbling 10.5% in March. Cheaper gasoline amid a collapse in crude oil prices offset a 1.5% surge in the cost of food last month, which was the largest gain since January 1990, after a 0.3% rise in March.
Prices for food consumed at home accelerated 2.6%, the largest advance since February 1974, amid broad gains in all six major grocery store food groups. 
There have been shortages of meat amid COVID-19 outbreaks at processing plants. The cost of food consumed at home increased only 0.5% in March. In the 12 months through April, the CPI gained 0.3%, the smallest annual rise since October 2015, after increasing 1.5% in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI falling 0.8% in April and rising 0.4% year-on-year.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
STRONG HEALTHCARE COSTS
The Labor Department said in-store data collection has been suspended since March 16 because of the public health crisis. It added that data collection last month was also impacted ""by the temporary closing or limited operations of certain types of establishments,"" leading to ""an increase in the number of prices being considered temporarily unavailable and imputed."" 
That resulted in many indexes being based on smaller amounts of collected prices than usual, and a small number of indexes that are normally published were not published in April.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI dropped 0.4% in April, the largest decline since the series started in 1957. The so-called core CPI dipped 0.1% in March, which was the first drop since January 2010. April marked the first back-to-back fall in the core CPI since 1982.
Underlying inflation was depressed in April by a record 8.1% plunge in the cost of hotel and motel accommodation. It was also cheaper to fly last month, with the cost of airline fares tumbling a record 15.2% after decreasing 12.6% in March. Apparel dropped a record 4.7% last month after declining 2.0% in March.
Economists expect the broad deflationary trend to give way to higher inflation at least next year partly because of extraordinary measures by the Federal Reserve to cushion the economy's fall, including programs to help keep companies afloat. A historic fiscal package of around $3 trillion and rebounding oil prices as producers cut output are also factors. 
Lingering disruptions to the supply chain could see some goods remain in short supply, boosting prices, though that could be tempered by cheaper hotel and air travel.
""This is not to suggest that we see runaway inflation coming down the road, we do not, but the market's pricing of inflation at effectively zero is unrealistic and excessively pessimistic,"" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in New York.
In the 12 months through April, the core CPI rose 1.4%, the smallest increase since April 2011, after advancing 2.1% in March. The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. 
The core PCE price index increased 1.7% year-on-year in March after rising 1.8% in February. April's core PCE price index data will be released at the end of the month.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, gained 0.2% after increasing 0.3% in March. Rent increases slowed last month, likely reflecting forbearance agreements between landlords and tenants who have lost their jobs or have had their hours reduced because of the global pandemic.
A record 33.5 million people filed claims for unemployment benefits since March 21, when states and locals governments enforced ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders, affecting more than 90% of the country. 
But healthcare costs rose a solid 0.4% in April, matching the prior month's increase. There was a 0.6% jump in the price of prescription medication. Hospital services climbed 0.5%.
The gains suggest a pickup in healthcare spending early in the second quarter after expenditures collapsed in the January-March period as people shunned hospitals, fearful of contracting COVID-19. Hospitals also suspended elective procedures to focus on COVID-19 patients. 

The cost of doctor visits dipped 0.1% last month, likely as patient traffic to doctor's offices remained light.

At the same time, a net 29% of small-business owners, the most since October 2018, said the economy will be better in six months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A key economic indicator in Japan fell at the fastest pace since 2011 in March and the government warned of a deep recession as the coronavirus crisis takes a heavy toll on business activity and consumer spending.
In Tuesday's coincident indicator index report, the government maintained its view that the economy was ""worsening"" in March, backing other data during that month and in April which paint a bleak outlook. 
The index of coincident economic indicators, which consists of a range of data including factory output, employment and retail sales, dropped a preliminary 4.9 points to 90.5 in March from the previous month, the Cabinet Office said.
It was the fastest pace of decline since March 2011 when a devastating earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster hit Japan.
A Reuters poll forecast showed Japan had already slipped into recession as the health crisis is expected to have led to a second straight quarter of economic contraction in January-March. 
Analysts expect an even deeper contraction in the current quarter, as the government's decision to declare a state of emergency in April kept many citizens at home and forced businesses to close.
Another index for leading economic indicators, which is a gauge of the economy a few months ahead and is compiled using data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, fell 8.1 points to 83.8 from February.
It was the biggest drop on record since comparable data became available from 1985.

The government has already a multi-billion dollar package of stimulus measures to backstop the economy, and on Monday Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signalled readiness to compile a second supplementary budget during the current Diet session running through June.

The index measures factory output from the manufacturing, mining and electricity generation sectors.
The drop was just shy of the 5% fall forecast by analysts surveyed by Reuters and the steepest since May 2011, when it declined 5.2%. In February, the index had risen 5.8%, fastest in more than two years. 
All three main sectors tracked by the index posted declines in March, with electricity output falling 7% from a year earlier, the Statistics Department said in a statement.

The share of mortgage loans in forbearance rose to 7.91% from 7.54% from April 27 to May 3, the industry lobbying group said. The number of new requests for relief fell relative to the prior week for the fourth consecutive survey period, MBA said.
Ginnie Mae loans once again had the highest percentage of loans in forbearance by investor type, at 10.96% of loans.
At least 33 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment benefits since March 21, equivalent to roughly one out of every five workers losing their job in just over a month, and there have been numerous delays in disbursing the money.
More than 95% of Americans had been under ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders to curb the spread of the virus, causing widespread business shutdowns, although many U.S. states have now at least partially lifted shutdowns in a bid to reopen their economies.
""Although the pace of forbearance requests slowed this week, call volume picked up – which could be a sign that more borrowers are calling in to check their options now that May due dates have arrived,"" said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's senior vice president and chief economist.

Consumers' perceived chances of losing their jobs rose to the highest level seen since the survey launched in 2013. Their expectations of how much they would earn and spend dropped to a series low. Inflation expectations increased only slightly for the next year and three years, but there was more uncertainty about the forecasts.
As millions of Americans lost their jobs, they became more pessimistic about the hit their finances would take during the downturn - and worried about facing long spells of unemployment.
Workers said there was a 20.9% chance, on average, that they could lose their job in the next 12 months, an increase of 2.4 percentage points from the month before. The perceived chances of finding a new job in the next three months, after becoming unemployed, dropped 6.1 percentage points to 47.0% in April - the largest monthly decline since the launch of the survey.
Nearly four in 10 respondents said they are worse off today financially than they were a year ago, up from 30% in March and compared to 15% a year ago.
The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll based on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.
Expectations for inflation over the next year and the next three years, usually one of the main focuses of the survey, increased slightly to 2.6%.
Consumers also worried the downturn could affect the housing market. For the first time since the survey was launched in 2013, the median respondent did not expect home prices to increase over the next year. Some 44% of respondents said they expect home prices to decline over the next 12 months.

The fall in output was larger than any of the 18 forecasts in a Reuters survey of analysts which pointed to a 20.0% decline.
National statistics bureau ISTAT, which issued the data on Monday, said it was the steepest fall in industrial production since the current series began in 1990.
February's data was revised to show a 1.0% decline, originally reported at -1.2%.
On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, output in March was down 29.3%, also the steepest drop since the start of the series, following a 2.3% fall in February. 
The restrictions to contain one of Europe's worst outbreaks of the coronavirus were in place through most of March and closed all factories except those considered essential to the supply chain. They were partially eased from May 4.
In the first quarter, output in the euro zone's third largest economy was down 8.4% compared with the previous three months, ISTAT said, following a 1.1% drop in the fourth quarter of last year.
Industrial production plunged across the board in March, ISTAT said, with output of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products all down by between 10% and 40% from the month before.

The euro zone's third-largest economy shrank 4.7% in the first quarter from the previous three months, preliminary data showed last week, as the lockdown took a heavy toll on activity.
The government forecasts gross domestic product to post a full-year contraction of 8.0%.

Order intake fell 2%, sales were down 5.7% and exports were 8.4% lower in the three months to the end of March, the association said in its quarterly study.
But the full impact of the new coronavirus pandemic was still not evident in the figures, said the organisation which represents the machinery, electrical and metal (MEM) engineering industries.
With forward-looking indicators like the Purchasing Managers Index dropping to long-term lows, the prospects looked grim for the rest of the year, Swissmem said.
Almost three quarters of member companies surveyed expect a fall in new orders from abroad, while nearly half have seen orders cancelled due to the pandemic.
These problems meant 80% of companies in the sector had applied for short-time working, a scheme where the government pays part of the wages of staff not working 100%, Swissmem said.
""The situation in the MEM companies deteriorated significantly in April,"" Swissmem President Hans Hess said.
""All leading indicators point to a massive drop in sales from the second quarter of 2020 onwards,"" he added. ""At the moment, it is completely open as to when things will start to pick up again.""

Exports contracted 46.3% year-on-year in the period, while imports fell an equally dizzying 37.2%, data from the Korea Customs Service showed on Monday.
By categories, overseas sales of semiconductors dropped 17.8%, while that for mobile communication devices and petrochemical products contracted sharply by 35.9% and 75.6%, respectively. 
The numbers from South Korea, the first major exporting nation to release monthly trade data, underscores the pandemic's devastating impact across supply chains and businesses, and points to a rough yeah ahead for international trade. 
The export-reliant economy stumbled into its biggest contraction since 2008 in the first quarter even as the Bank of Korea slashed interest rates  by 50 basis points to a fresh low of 0.75% in March, as self-isolation measures hit consumption and global trade slumped.
Its two biggest trading partners, the United States and China saw their economies contract sharply in the first quarter, suggesting a recovery in global trade is some way off.
Data released last week for China, the world's biggest exporter, showed a rebound in shipments but imports marked the biggest contraction since early 2016 - an outcome that backed expectations for a period of frail trade.

The jobless rate should have included people on temporary unpaid leave, furloughed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the government said.
But responses to the survey by which the data was collected show 11.5 million people were categorized as employed but absent from work because of vacation, parental leave or other reasons, but including 8.1 million absent for ""unspecified"" reasons, a group that usually numbers about 620,000.
""One assumption might be that these additional 7.5 million workers ...should have been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff,"" a note attached to the government's jobs report Friday said.
If they had been classified as such, the note said, the jobless rate would have come in at 19.5%.
The jobs report probably also undercounted the unemployment rate in a second way - by missing people who wanted work but weren't looking for it because of near-ubiquitous stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The Labor Department excludes people who are not in an active job search from its count of the unemployed, classifying them instead as out of the workforce.
But in April, 9.9 million people who were not in the labor force - one in every 10 - also said they wanted a job, the highest number since the Labor Department began keeping track.
""The large increase in the want a job category reflects the impact of the pandemic on the job market, as mandatory business closures, stay-at-home orders, and concerns about the coronavirus kept many individuals from engaging in labor market activity in April,"" the Labor Department said.
Adding those people to the survey's finding of 23.1 million people unemployed in April would represent 19.8% of the labor force plus those who want a job, the Labor Department said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada lost a record-breaking 2 million jobs in April while the unemployment rate surged to a near-record high 13%, according to official data released on Friday that did not reflect the full extent of layoffs caused by coronavirus shutdowns.
Although the numbers were not as bad as markets had feared, Statistics Canada said they did not capture the 1.1 million people who had temporarily lost their jobs and who expected to return to work once restrictions were relaxed.
Had these people been counted as jobless, the April unemployment rate would have been a record 17.8%.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted the jobs numbers were ""difficult"" and said Ottawa was doing everything it could to support those affected.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a loss of 4 million jobs and an unemployment rate of 18%, up from the 7.8% seen in March, when 1 million jobs were lost.
""The unemployment rate at 13% is not something to be excited about, but it's a lot better than feared. I would say that the jobs figures probably understate the weakness in the economy,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
The Canadian dollar strengthened to a one-week high of C$1.3939 to the U.S. dollar, or 71.74 U.S. cents.
The highly anticipated April employment data was leaked ahead of its 8:30 a.m. ET (1230 GMT) release. Statscan said it was probing the early release.
Most non-essential businesses have been shut since mid-March as officials urge people to stay at home, but in recent weeks, some of the 10 Canadian provinces have started to gradually reopen their economies.
As of May 5, more than 7.5 million Canadians had applied for some form of federal employment aid, according to government data.
""Almost all (97.0%) of the newly-unemployed were on temporary layoff ... indicating that they expected to return to their former employer as the shutdown is relaxed,"" Statscan said in a commentary. The labor participation rate slid to 59.8% from 63.5% in March.
The record for the highest unemployment rate since Statscan adopted their current labor force model in January 1976 was the 13.1% seen in December 1982.
Some 1.47 million full-time jobs were lost along with 522,00 part-time positions. 
""It is still obviously bad. You have 2 million people out of work (and) it's also they worked for a lot less hours than they normally would,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at the Royal Bank of Canada.
""This is still consistent with a really, really sharp drop in output or another big decline in overall economic activity in April,"" he said by phone. 
In a separate release, Statistics Canada said the value of Canadian building permits fell 13.2% in March from February.

The share of unemployed people on temporary layoff soared to almost 80%, the highest on record, from 26.5% a month earlier, according to Labor Department figures issued Friday. The overall unemployment rate jumped to 14.7%, the highest since the 1940s, from 4.4%.
Such a large share of temporarily unemployed Americans indicates they may be able return to their previous employers quickly as the nation emerges from the economic stoppage.
Erica Groshen, former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, wrote earlier this month that former employees will immediately be productive because they won’t require onboarding or training.
“Furthermore, while they await recall, workers likely won’t delay as much consumption as if they faced the greater uncertainty of needing to find a new job,” Groshen said. “By the same token, employers are spared the uncertainties of getting the skilled workforce they need, so they can make the purchases they need to be ready to start up again.”

The benchmark IPCA index fell 0.31% from March, more than the median estimate for a 0.24% decline from economists in a Bloomberg survey. In twelve months, consumer prices rose 2.40%, the national statistics agency reported on its website on Friday. The monthly drop was the biggest since August 1998, the agency said.
Brazil now joins Mexico in posting monthly deflation as the coronavirus pandemic brings Latin America’s two largest economies to a halt. The reading comes two days after Brazil’s central bank delivered a larger-than-expected rate cut and signaled another reduction is on tap. Policy makers also forecast consumer prices will end this year below the 2.5% floor of their target range.
On the month, transportation costs fell by 2.66% driven by falling fuel prices including gasoline, the national statistics agency reported. Meanwhile, food and beverage costs rose by 1.79%, representing the biggest inflation driver on the month.
Local governments are toughening restrictions on commerce and movement as the coronavirus death toll shows no sign of slowing. While helping to curb the spread of the virus, those measures are decimating activity and will hasten a double-digit drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter, according to Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brasil.
Crashing demand has helped soften the potential inflationary impact from a weak real, which plunged to a record low after the central bank’s rate decision on Wednesday."

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy shed over 20 million nonfarm jobs in April, the biggest monthly drop ever, vividly illustrating the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Nonfarm payrolls fell 20.5 million from March -- compared with a forecast of a drop of 21 million -- according to Labor Department data Friday, as government-mandated shutdowns and the prospect of slumping consumer activity forced firms to lay off workers in droves.
That comes after a decline of 871,000 in March, a figure revised from an initially estimated drop of 701,000, when an historic 113-month run of employment growth ended. The figures eradicate - if only temporarily - all the jobs created since the end of the Great Recession a decade ago.t
The jobless rate jumped to 14.7%, a post war high, from 4.4% last month. The broader U6 measure of under-employment rose to 22.8% from 8.7% a month earlier.
More than 33 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits in the past seven weeks. Restrictions such as stay-at-home orders and social distancing aimed at mitigating the spread of the virus have crippled business activity.
The data will likely add to the enormous pressure on states to reopen, even though the number of new coronavirus cases is still climbing in many parts of the country.
The BLS's data showed that the job losses had hit lower-paid Americans hardest. 
""The vast majority of jobs losses were in the low wage (and low hours sectors)."" Dan Alpert, managing partner of Westwood Capital, via Twitter. He noted that 18.1 million of the 20.5 million of jobs lost were production and non-supervisory. "

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending plunged in March and service-sector activity shrank at a record pace in April, reinforcing expectations that the coronavirus pandemic is tipping the world's third-largest economy into deep recession.
Overtime pay - a barometer of strength in corporate activity - also plunged at a record pace in March, data showed, a sign companies were hit by shrinking business even before the government announced a state of emergency in early April.
The weak readings make it a near certainty the economy suffered a second straight quarter of contraction in January-March, the technical definition of a recession, and was on track for a deeper decline in the current quarter as the health crisis kept shoppers home and businesses closed.
""Even without the virus, Japan's economy was very weak due to the hit from last year's sales tax hike. The pandemic has completely destroyed any chance of a recovery,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
""The economy may rebound somewhat in July-September but won't return to pre-coronavirus levels for the rest of this year,"" said Saito, who expects the economy to contract an annualised 30% in the current quarter.
Household spending slumped 6.0% in March from a year earlier following a 0.3% fall in February, marking the biggest drop in five years, government data showed on Friday.
The decline, a tad smaller than a median market forecast for a 6.7% fall, was due largely to plunging demand for travel, clothing and eating out as the government asked citizens to refrain from going out and some businesses to shut down.
There were some winners with firms that provide catering for people at home seeing increased business.
Spending on pasta jumped 44% as people cooked at home more often, while purchases of gaming consoles more than doubled as school closures kept children housebound. However, those increases were not enough to make up for the plunging demand for other items.
JOB OUTLOOK DARKENS
The data will likely drag on preliminary first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data due on May 18. Analysts polled by Reuters expect Japan's economy to contract an annualised 4.6% in the January-March period.
Many analysts expect the economy to plunge by at least 20% in the current quarter, piling pressure on the government to top up an already massive $1.1 trillion stimulus package to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic.
With infections in Japan exceeding 15,000, the government extended a state of emergency on Monday through to the end of the month, pressuring companies to shut down factories and stores longer than previously expected.
Other data paint a similarly bleak picture on the outlook.
Japan's services sector shrank at the fastest pace on record in April as a huge blow to demand from the outbreak hurt business activity, a business survey showed.
Inflation-adjusted real wages fell in March for the first time in three months as overtime pay slumped 4.1% from a year earlier, falling at the fastest pace on record.
Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics, expects Japan's job market to worsen sharply in coming months and push down wages of retailers hit by the pandemic.
""Looking ahead, leading indicators are pointing towards a spike in the unemployment rate – we think it will climb to 4.2% towards the end of this year,"" he said.
""Corporate profits are no doubt falling fast so total pay will be dragged down further by a slump in bonus payments.""
Japan's jobless rate stood at 2.5% in March.

The health crisis hit an economy that already suffered a contraction in the final quarter of last year due to the hit on consumption from an October sales tax hike.

GfK, a polling firm, said its consumer confidence index - which it is now publishing every two weeks - rose to -33 in the April 20-26 period from -34 during the first half of the month.
""Consumer confidence in Britain's lockdown economy is still severely depressed,"" GfK's client strategy director Joe Staton said. ""However, we are recording small improvements in our personal finances and the wider economic picture for the next 12 months, key indicators when gauging optimism for our path to recovery."" 
GfK detected a small three-point pick-up in its Major Purchase Index, possibly indicating pent-up demand, but a nine-point spike in the Savings Index suggested consumers were being cautious.

Nonfarm business employee output per hour decreased at a 2.5% annualized rate in the first three months of the year, according to Labor Department figures Thursday. The decline matched the median projection in Bloomberg’s survey of economists and followed a 1.2% fourth-quarter increase.
Output fell at a 6.2% annualized rate, while hours worked declined 3.8%. Accounting for productivity, unit labor costs increased at a 4.8% rate after rising at a 0.9% pace in the previous three months.
The record-long U.S. expansion came to an all-but-official end in the first quarter as state governments ordered many businesses to close or operate in limited fashion to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. With sales depressed until the economy opens up, companies will probably continue cutting worker hours in a bid to shore up productivity.
A separate report showed 3.17 million Americans filed jobless claims in the week ended May 2, bringing the total to about 33.5 million since the coronavirus began closing restaurants, factories and offices from coast to coast in mid-March.

790,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Millions more Americans join the unemployment line,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Millions more Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, suggesting layoffs broadened from consumer-facing industries to other segments of the economy and could remain elevated even as many parts of the country start to reopen. 
The Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report on Thursday showed initial jobless claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.169 million for the week ended May 2, down from a revised 3.846 million in the prior week. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 3.0 million claims in the last week compared to the previously reported 3.839 million in the week ending April 25. 
The data supported economists' views of a protracted recovery of the economy, which is reeling from nationwide lockdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The economy shrank in the first quarter at the steepest pace since the Great Recession of 2007-2009. 
The weekly claims report followed news on Wednesday that private payrolls fell by a record 20.2 million in April, which set up the overall labor market for historic job losses. 
It marked the fifth straight weekly decrease in applications since hitting a record 6.867 million in the week ended March 28. Still, the latest numbers lifted to about 33 million the number of people who have filed claims for unemployment benefits since March 21. 
""The pace of new claims for unemployment is slowing, but remains at levels unimaginable just a few months ago,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
""Even with the economy slowly starting to reopen, the number of unemployed should continue to rise sharply as governments, as well as businesses that have tried but not succeeded at holding the line, are now laying off workers,"" he said.
Thursday's weekly claims data will have no impact on the Labor Department's comprehensive employment report for April, which is scheduled to be released on Friday, as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed establishments and households for its monthly report.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have plunged by a historic 22 million in April, which would blow away the record 800,000 dive seen during the 2007-2009 recession. Employment dropped by 701,000 jobs in March, ending a record streak of gains dating to September 2010. 
The unemployment rate is seen jumping to 16% in April, which would shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982. In March the jobless rate shot up 0.9 percentage point, the largest monthly change since January 1975, to 4.4%.

April could, however, mark the trough in job losses as more small businesses access their portion of an almost $3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for them to get loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries. At least 30 states are partially reopening, which could see some of the unemployed going back to work.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits totaled 3.17 million in the week ending May 2, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday, remaining at historic levels even as many parts of the country start to reopen.
Continuing claims, which record the number of people already receiving benefits increased to a new record 22.64 million in the week ending April 25, the report said, up from 18.01 million a week earlier. Continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag.
Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected initial jobless claims to fall to 3 million and continuing claims to rise to 19.91 million.
It was the fifth straight weekly decrease in jobless claims applications since they hit a record 6.8 million in the week ended March 28 amid statewide lockdowns aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Even with the economy slowly starting to reopen, the number of unemployed should continue to rise sharply as governments, as well as businesses that have tried but not succeeded at holding the line, are now laying off workers,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
""The pace of new claims for unemployment is slowing but remains at levels unimaginable just a few months ago.""
The figures come a day after ADP data showing that the private sector shed a record 20 million jobs last month and ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for April on Friday, which is expected to show unprecedented job losses.
Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari said Thursday that the upcoming nonfarm payrolls data is likely to understate the number of jobs lost because many people are not actively searching for new work.
Kashkari said the reported unemployment rate could be as high as 17%, but the true unemployment rate may be as high as 23%. ""That bad report tomorrow is actually going to understate how bad the damage has been,"" he said.

792,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",China's April exports rebound but outlook remains grim,"By Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports unexpectedly rose in April for the first time this year as factories raced to make up for lost sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, but a big fall in imports signalled more trouble ahead as the global economy sinks into recession.
April's better-than-expected exports helped Asian shares trim early losses, but analysts say China's trade outlook remains bleak as major economies remain in the grip of the health crisis with rising infection numbers and deaths.
Overseas shipments in April rose 3.5% from a year earlier, marking the first positive growth since December last year, customs data showed on Thursday. That compared with a 15.7% drop forecast in a Reuters poll and a 6.6% plunge in March.
The increase was driven in part by rising exports of medical equipment, traditional Chinese medicine and textiles including masks. China exported millions of tonnes of medical products worth 71.2 billion yuan ($10 billion) in the March-April period, according to the customs agency. The daily export value of medical supplies jumped by more than three times last month.
Some economists also attributed the rise in exports to factory closures elsewhere, leading to a surge in import demand, just as China's manufacturers reopened after extended shutdowns due to the virus outbreak. 
""Not only was the global demand taking a hit from the coronavirus, but the shock to the production side was actually more pronounced last month,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust.
A better export performance than expected could extend into May as some production constraints remain in place for other economies, Nie said.
""But I'm particularly worried about the slump in foreign demand - the impact would only be fully felt later on as world factories reopen.""
In light of the rebound in April shipments, Nomura raised its forecasts for China's exports to minus 22% for May and June from minus 30% previously, but still deep in contraction as the coronavirus crisis ravages the global economy.
""Given the continued contraction of export orders in March and April – as suggested by the sharp drop in new export orders sub-index of official and Caixin manufacturing PMIs – we do not think the improvement in April's export growth is sustainable,"" Nomura's analysts said in a note. 
Both official and private factory surveys for April showed export orders collapsed, even as some countries started easing lockdowns.
Many Chinese factories are grappling with slashed or cancelled overseas orders after reopening as global demand stays tepid. They are faced with rising inventory and falling profits, and some have let workers go as part of cost-cutting efforts. 
WEAK DOMESTIC DEMAND
Imports sank 14.2% from a year earlier, the biggest contraction since January 2016 and below market expectations of an 11.2% drop. They had fallen 0.9% the previous month. 
The soft imports reading was due to weak domestic demand and declines in commodity prices. The shutdowns outside China also dealt a heavy supply shock to the country's importers.
China's trade surplus for the period stood at $45.34 billion, compared with an expected $6.35 billion surplus and a surplus of $19.93 billion in March.
With the coronavirus under control domestically, China's economy has begun to open up again as authorities loosen draconian restrictions including stay-at-home orders, but economists say the recovery has been disappointing. 
""There is further downside for imports too given the slow domestic recovery, already elevated inventory levels, and the fact that over a quarter of imports feed into China's export sector,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""The threat of additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods shouldn't be ignored given the likelihood that the 'phase one' trade deal soon falls apart – imports from the United States remained near multi-year lows last month.""
Customs data showed on Thursday that China imported $36.7 billion goods from the United States in the first four months of the year. That compared with a target of Chinese purchases worth about $218 billion this year under the first-phase trade deal. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said he was watching closely whether China would meet its commitments to increase U.S. goods purchases under the early phase trade deal. 

China could roll out more support measures to stimulate domestic demand in the event that tensions with the United States flare up again, Nie from Hwabao Trust said.

793,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2020 05:09AM ET</span>",Norway Delivers Surprise Rate Cut to Historic Low of 0%,"(Bloomberg) -- Norges Bank delivered an unexpected interest rate cut to zero, as policy makers in Norway react to the combined fallout from the Covid-19 crisis and the collapse of oil prices.
The deposit rate was cut by a quarter point to the lowest ever in Norway. Only two of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected the move; the rest predicted no change.
The bank said its decision was unanimous, but also signaled it didn’t want to reduce rates further.
“Activity in the Norwegian economy has fallen abruptly as a result of the coronavirus pandemic,” it said. “The downturn is amplified by the severe impact of the pandemic on surrounding countries and by a sharp fall in oil prices.”
Policy makers in Oslo had already resorted to an unprecedented series of measures in March, slashing 1.25 percentage points off the main rate over two emergency meetings. Norges Bank has also added cheap bank loans and currency interventions to its arsenal.
Kristoffer Kjaer Lomholt, senior analyst at Danske Bank, called the decision a “big surprise.” But he said all signals from the bank point to “zero probability” of another cut into negative rates.
Norway’s currency traded about 1.3% stronger against the euro after the announcement, compared with about 2.1% before.
Thursday’s rate reduction was all the more surprising given the bank’s past signals that it’s skeptical toward zero and subzero rates, because of the potential damage they might do to banks. But Norges Bank said the extreme policy may now prevent an even worse economic crisis from taking hold and becoming entrenched.
“Low interest rates cannot prevent the coronavirus outbreak from having a substantial impact on the Norwegian economy, but can help dampen the downturn. As the situation normalizes, low interest rates will support a faster rebound in activity. This may reduce the risk of unemployment becoming entrenched at a high level.”
Governor Oystein Olsen said it was the bank’s “current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks” that the key rate “will most likely remain at today’s level for some time ahead. We do not envisage making further policy rate cuts.”
For Western Europe’s biggest crude producer, the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has been compounded by a devastating collapse in oil prices. One official estimate puts the economic contraction in March alone at 14%.
On Thursday, Norges Bank predicted a 5.2% GDP slump for all of 2020, with a 3% rebound expected next year (the estimates are for Norway’s mainland economy).
The economic pain of the double crisis is forcing the government to make record withdrawals from Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund. As a result, the investment vehicle may have to liquidate assets for the first time in its history to provide the cash the government needs.

The auto industry, which was Germany's biggest exporter and employed more than 800,000 people before the outbreak, contracted by 31.1% on the month.
Analysts said worse was in store. Andreas Scheuerle of DekaBank calling the headline reading ""a curtain raiser for the horror show"".
Expectations in a Reuters poll were for a 7.5% drop.
A breakdown of the data showed that export-dependent manufacturing was most affected by the slump in demand, contracting by 11.6%, including a 16.5% drop in capital goods.
Figures published on Wednesday showed that orders for German industrial goods dived 15.6% in March to their lowest level since records began in 1991.
Construction offered the only glimmer of hope. Activity rose by almost 2%, the data showed.
The data reflected the impact of a shutdown and restrictions that Germany imposed in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. So far, it has withstood the pandemic better than the United States and most of its European neighbours.
SLOW RECOVERY
The government expects the economy to shrink by a record 6.3% this year despite measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis with a 750 billion-euro ($809.33 billion) stimulus package and a short-time work subsidy scheme that lets employers move staff to shorter hours rather than laying them off.
The Ifo institute said on Thursday that its industrial production index had hit its lowest level since German reunification, signalling that the sector expects an unprecedented collapse in activity.
Helge Braun, Merkel's chief of staff, said on Thursday the pandemic will last for at least the rest of this year and economists have cast doubt on a quick economic recovery even as Germany starts to reopen its economy and lift restrictions.
""There is sure to be another large fall in April given that severe restrictions were in effect throughout last month,"" said Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics. ""We expect demand to recover only slowly because many households have suffered a loss of income and savings, and will be less confident about the future.""
Merkel announced steps on Wednesday to ease the coronavirus lockdown in Germany. At the same time, she installed an ""emergency brake"" mechanism to restore restrictions if infections pick up again.
Under measures agreed with Germany's 16 federal state leaders, people from two households will be allowed to meet, and more shops will open, provided hygiene measures are in place.
Analysts said even if the domestic economy recovers, a full German recovery depends on the pace of economic activity in its European neighbours.

""No matter how quickly Germany gets back to normal, it will be constrained by the recovery in the rest of Europe given its dependence on external demand,"" Kenningham wrote in a note.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' economic growth unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter as the coronavirus pandemic brought domestic consumption and business activity to a grinding halt. 
Gross domestic product contracted 0.2% in January to March from the same period last year, the first decline since the fourth quarter of 1998, data from the statistics agency showed on Thursday. That compares with the 3.1% expansion expected in a Reuters poll.
Growth in the fourth quarter was revised upwards to 6.7%, from 6.4% previously, after the statistics office changed the base year it uses to calculate economic output to 2018 from 2000.
To slow the rising cases of the new coronavirus, the Philippines placed the main island of Luzon, which accounts for more than two thirds of the economy and half of the population of more than 107 million, on lockdown from mid-March until the end of April.
The enhanced community quarantine (ECQ), as the measures are called, was relaxed from May 1, paving the way for incremental resumption of work and commercial activity in low risk areas. However the capital Manila, where most cases are, remains under strict stay-at-home orders.
""Containing the spread of the virus and saving hundreds of thousands of lives through the imposition of ECQ has come at a great cost to the Philippine economy,"" Acting Economic Planning Secretary Karl Chua told an online news conference.
The Philippines' benchmark share index (PSI) was down 0.2% by 0236 GMT, while the Philippine peso fell as low as 50.54 to the dollar, from Wednesday's close of 50.46.
""We can start reversing the economic trajectory by June,"" Chua said, as the government accelerates spending on big ticket infrastructure projects. 
The Philippines recorded its first local transmission of the virus in March and has since registered more than 10,000 confirmed cases and more than 600 deaths.
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has cut interest rates three times this year, with the latest move in April an off-cycle easing that brought the benchmark interest rate  to a record low of 2.75%.

Before the release of Thursday's data, BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno hinted he was in no rush to slash policy rates again, saying it would be prudent on the part of policymakers to wait for the recent cuts to work their way through the economy.

801,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 11:05PM ET</span>","Australia trade surplus surges to record on gold rush, improving China demand","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's trade surplus ballooned to a record in March as shipments of iron ore to China surged as the Asian giant came back from lockdown, while exports of gold more than tripled amid a global rush for the safe haven metal.
There was also a rare surplus on services as the closure of international borders to contain the coronavirus forced Australians to abandon travel plans and stay home.
In all, the trade surplus swelled 174% to A$10.6 billion ($6.79 billion) in March, easily the fattest on record and far above forecasts of A$6.8 billion.
The bumper haul meant the surplus for the entire first quarter climbed 41% to A$19 billion, likely delivering a timely lift to economic growth just before lockdowns began in earnest.
""Taking into account price effects, we now estimate that net trade provided a 0.4 ppt (percentage point) boost to GDP growth in Q1,"" said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics.
""We expect commodity exports to hold up the Chinese economy is starting to recover ... but imports are likely to slump,"" he added. ""The upshot is that trade will likely make a solid positive contribution to growth in Q2 as well.""
That contribution will be swamped by the closure of whole chunks of the economy from late March onward amid strict social distancing, sending gross domestic product (GDP) into a tailspin for this quarter.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) this week warned economic output for the first half of the year will likely plunge by 10%, while unemployment could double.
Still, the March trade numbers were a light amid the gloom with exports leaping 15.1% while imports fell 3.6%.
Exports of iron ore alone surged by a third to A$11.6 billion as shipments recovered from cyclone disruptions in February and Chinese factories got back to work.
Coal and liquefied natural gas also enjoyed a strong month, but it was non-monetary gold that really stood out with a rise of 225% to A$3.6 billion.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics noted the jump in gold earnings was driven by exports to Hong Kong and the UK.
Financial markets went into a meltdown in the middle of March which stoked demand for physical gold.
There was even a silver lining in the closure of borders as typically Australians travel and spend more overseas than the money made from inbound tourism.

As a result while tourism credits fell A$734 million in the month, debits dived A$1.5 billion.

802,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>",China's services sector contracts for third month as job losses hit record: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services firms wallowed in contraction in April as layoffs hit a record and export orders plunged after signs of improvement in March, a private survey showed, dashing hopes of a quick recovery from the coronavirus blow. 
The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) did manage to pull up to 44.4 in April from 43 in March, but remained in a deep slump and far below historic averages. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The third straight month of contraction for China's services sector, an important generator of jobs and which accounts for about 60% of the economy, suggests a still turbulent period ahead after the collapse in economic activity in the first quarter, when gross domestic product shrank 6.8%.
It also raised worries about the outlook even though the pandemic has been largely brought under control domestically, as a sharp global downturn dampens demand for Chinese goods and services.
""The second shockwave for China's economy brought about by shrinking overseas demand should not be underestimated in the second quarter,"" said Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group.
Major economies, including the United States and Europe, remain in the grip of the pandemic amid rapidly rising infections and deaths. The sweeping impact of the coronavirus, with the global death toll at well over 250,000, has many worried that a worldwide recession could be far more damaging than first thought. 
In April, new export orders shrank further after their pace of contraction slowed in March, declining at the second-fastest rate on record, just marginally better than February's collapse.
That underscored the brief nature of March's rebound as it was mainly due to delayed deliveries of orders received before the Lunar New Year holiday, Zhong said.
Dwindling exports pushed overall new business lower, and backlogs of work declined again as orders dried up, suggesting the recovery in domestic consumption has been insufficient to offset the significant downdraft in external demand. 
The frailty in services activity comes despite increased infrastructure spending, among other stimulus efforts at home. Over the past few months, officials have cut some taxes and fees, and told banks to extend cheap loans and debt payment relief to firms that have been hardest hit. 
Sluggish demand also prompted services companies to reduce their payrolls for the third month at the fastest pace on record in April. They also slashed their selling prices for the fifth straight month amid fierce competition for sales.
""Bigger tax and fee cuts are urgently needed,"" Zhong said.
Sources have told Reuters the growing economic toll caused by the coronavirus has increased calls from top policy advisers for the government to hasten the rollout of fiscal stimulus.
Some analysts expect Beijing to roll out a comprehensive stimulus package akin to the one launched soon after the global financial crisis, which pulled China out of the slump more quickly than elsewhere in the world albeit at the cost of mounting debt. But others caution China's higher leverage will limit the scope of any such measures. 
The findings from the private sector survey, which focuses more on small, export-oriented companies, also contrasted with an official survey last week pointing to an expansion in activity. 
Beijing is due to hold its annual parliament meeting later this month, where the government will unveil key economic targets for the year. The much-anticipated meeting has been delayed for over two months due to the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Thursday, picked up to 47.6 from 46.7 in March. Though the rise suggests that the initial shock from the virus outbreak is easing, the reading remained below historical averages.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's job market came to a dead stop in April as the coronavirus lockdown prompted a huge drop in economic activity, from which businesses will take time to recover, surveys showed on Thursday.
Demand for labour contracted at the fastest pace in the 22-year history of the monthly Report on Jobs published by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation trade body and accountants KPMG.
The figures chimed with other signs that Britain is in the midst of a historic collapse in economic output after measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus forced company closures across the country last month.
A recent Reuters poll of economists suggested the economy is on course to contract by around 13% in quarterly terms in the three months to June.
The Bank of England, which has already cut interest rates to historically low levels and ramped up its bond purchases by a record amount, could announce further stimulus later on Thursday when it publishes its May policy decision at 0600 GMT.
""The COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the UK jobs market with a record drop in vacancies and recruitment plans frozen,"" said James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG.
Separate reports from industry groups Make UK and the Institute of Directors (IoD) report suggested it may be a long road to recovery.
More than half of the companies surveyed by the IoD this month said it would take them more than a month to return to pre-lockdown levels of activity, even if restrictions were lifted entirely.
""Leaving lockdown, when it happens, won't be plain sailing for business. Social distancing presents an unprecedented challenge for firms, and some may be simply unable to make it work,"" Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said.
Around half of the 816 companies in the IoD survey thought they could return to pre-lockdown levels of activity with social distancing in place, but a fifth said they would be working at less than half capacity or could not operate at all.
""Many small firms may need support accessing protective equipment to get up and running again. Employers will need flexibility as the furlough scheme is unwound to manage the return to work,"" Geldart said.
More than a third of the almost 300 manufacturers in Make UK's survey said they did not expect trading to return to normal for six to 12 months after the COVID crisis ends.

Another 17% said it would take over a year to recover.

805,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>",Euro zone business activity collapses at record pace in April,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity across Europe almost ground to a halt last month as government-imposed lockdowns to stop the spread of the coronavirus forced factories, shops and restaurants to close and many leisure activities to cease, a survey showed.
The coronavirus has infected nearly 3.7 million people globally and killed around 256,000 and, with citizens told to stay at home, supply chains have been massively disrupted. 
To combat the economic impact of the virus, the European Central Bank has pledged to buy more than 1 trillion euros in assets this year and governments have outlined hundreds of billions in spending plans to support businesses and households.
But the effect of the collective efforts is limited.
IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone, seen as a good indicator of economic health, plummeted to 13.6 in April from March's already dire 29.7, easily its lowest reading since the survey began in 1998.
That was a fraction better than the 13.5 preliminary reading but nowhere near the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The picture is dire. The overall view is that Germany is bad, Southern Europe looks even worse. Manufacturing is badly affected but not as bad as services,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg.
Germany's services sector recorded its weakest ever performance, pulling down overall private sector activity in Europe's largest economy to historically low levels.
French service providers saw an unprecedented collapse in business activity due to a nationwide lockdown that has forced all but non-essential firms to close.
The service industry in Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, shrank at the fastest rate in more than 22 years.
But, suggesting things there might pick up somewhat this month, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte partially eased its lockdown on Monday, allowing more factories to open and greater freedom of movement.
Germany and Spain are among other economies gradually emerging from lockdowns, but the outlook for an easing of restrictions elsewhere is less certain.
Sister surveys have shown business activity across Asia and the Americas also ground to a halt last month. Britain's economy is on course for an unprecedented 7% quarterly contraction its PMI showed on Tuesday. 
Forward-looking indicators in the euro zone survey were grim and the headline PMI pointed to GDP contracting at a quarterly rate of 7.5%, IHS Markit said. A Reuters poll late last month was even more gloomy, pencilling in a 9.6% contraction this quarter. 
Markets however largely ignored the data, instead focusing on mixed corporate earnings, lingering concerns about the easing of lockdowns and simmering U.S.-China tensions. 
STAY HOME, SAVE LIVES
Demand in the euro zone all but dried up as consumers concerned about their health and job prospects stayed home and stopped spending despite firms cutting prices at one of the steepest rates in the survey's history.
Those concerns are not unfounded. New coronavirus cases -- and deaths -- are still being reported daily and the employment index sank to 33.4 from 42.2 as boarded-up businesses shed workers at the fastest pace since the survey began.
With swathes of the economy closed, the bloc's dominant services industry was crippled and activity all but ceased. Its PMI sank to a survey low of 12.0 from 26.4 in March, slightly higher than the 11.7 flash estimate.
As some countries in the region are slowly starting to ease lockdown measures, while still very downbeat, optimism improved a touch. The services business expectations index rose to 34.3 from March's survey low of 33.5.
""Quite a few people think April was the trough. If you are asked 'do you think in six months will the situation be better?', if you are in absolute dire straits, you are inclined to say 'yes.' It is hope,"" Schmieding said.

806,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls dive by a record 20.2 million,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers laid off a record 20.236 million workers in April as mandatory business closures in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak savaged the economy, setting up the overall labor market for historic job losses last month.
The plunge in private payrolls shown in the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Wednesday suggested that national lockdowns to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, could leave lasting scars on the economy, even as large parts of the country reopen non-essential businesses.
""One thing for sure is that this pandemic health crisis has produced depression-magnitude job losses which means this recovery is going to take longer than many are thinking,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""The Great Depression lasted three and a half years, and it will be a miracle if the economy gets anywhere near back to normal within the next couple of years.""
Data for March was revised to show private payrolls decreasing by 149,000 jobs instead of the previously reported 27,000, which was the first decline since September 2017.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls tumbling by 20.050 million jobs in April. The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. 
The staggering numbers were widely anticipated, since 30.3 million people had filed claims for unemployment benefits since March 21, equivalent to nearly one out of every five workers losing their job in just over a month. 
The economy contracted in the first quarter at the steepest pace since the fourth quarter of 2008. The slumping economy and rising joblessness are big challenges for President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term in office in November's election.
Trump has been pushing for businesses to reopen and even supported demonstrations in some parts of the country against the ""stay-at-home"" orders. 
At least 30 states have partially reopened, though health experts and researchers have predicted a surge in infections and deaths.
""The jobs numbers are very, very chilling and I think that it's very important, you know, to let people understand in a very somber way that this is the biggest shock that our economy has ever seen, but it's something that we've done in order to get ahead of the curve on the disease,"" Trump's economic adviser, Kevin Hassett told Fox Business Network on Wednesday.
Layoffs last month were across small, medium and large enterprises. The leisure and hospitality industry shed 8.6 million jobs in April, accounting for more than 40% of the private sector job losses. Manufacturing lost 1.7 million jobs, while 2.5 million construction workers were laid off.

Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher amid hopes of a pickup in business activity as more states ease restrictions on movements, shifting investors' attention from the dismal employment numbers.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. government bond prices fell after the Treasury Department sharply increased the size of its long-dated debt auctions.
EYES ON EMPLOYMENT REPORT
""We are at the apex of the job losses,"" said Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. ""We should see a turn relatively soon in the job statistics, but we are not going to regain all the jobs we lost in the last couple of months."" 
The ADP report was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for April scheduled for release on Friday. While it has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report because of methodology differences, economists said it offered some clues on the size of anticipated job losses in April. 
The ADP noted that its April report ""does not reflect the full impact of COVID-19 on the overall employment situation."" 
""The ADP report and the government data don't always align, but at least the ADP report suggests that we are in the right ballpark when thinking about the massive job losses to expect in the government data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls are forecast to have tumbled by a historic 21.853 million in April, which would blow away the record 800,000 dive seen during the Great Recession. Employment dropped by 701,000 jobs in March, ending a record streak of gains dating to September 2010. 

The unemployment rate is seen jumping to 16% in April, which would shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982. In March the jobless rate shot up 0.9 percentage point, the largest monthly change since January 1975, to 4.4%.

Investing.com - The U.S. private sector shed a record 20.23 million jobs in April, according to a report by payrolls processor ADP, as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic continued to devastate the country's economy.
Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected the private sector to have shed 20.05 million jobs last month due to statewide lockdown measures.
March’s figure was revised to show job losses of 149,000 from the decline of 27,000 that was initially reported.
“Job losses of this scale are unprecedented. The total number of job losses for the month of April alone was more than double the total jobs lost during the Great Recession,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute.
“Additionally, it is important to note that the report is based on the total number of payroll records for employees who were active on a company’s payroll through the 12th of the month. As such, the April NER does not reflect the full impact of COVID-19 on the overall employment situation” the report said.
The ADP numbers come ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for April on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. That report is forecast to show the unemployment rate rose to 16% last month and that more than 20 million jobs were lost.
That would easily surpass the post-World War Two record unemployment rate of 10.8% reached in November 1982.
But economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago are estimating that the true rate of unemployment could be between 25.1% and 34.6%.
Ahead of that, Thursday’s jobless claims report is expected to show another surge of new claims for unemployment benefits.
All told, 26.453 million people have filed claims for jobless benefits since March 21, representing 16.2% of the labor force. The economy created 22 million jobs during the employment boom which started in September 2010 and abruptly ended in February this year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy will contract by a record 7.7% this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation will almost disappear while public debt and budget deficits will balloon, the European Commission forecast on Wednesday.
""Europe is experiencing an economic shock without precedent since the Great Depression,"" European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Paolo Gentiloni said.
""Both the depth of the recession and the strength of recovery will be uneven, conditioned by the speed at which lockdowns can be lifted, the importance of services like tourism in each economy and by each country's financial resources,"" he said.
The Commission forecast that, as the economy contracts this year, consumer prices will almost stagnate. The inflation rate will slow to 0.2% in 2020, before accelerating to 1.1% next year, when the euro zone is to return to growth of 6.3%. Investment will plunge 13.3% this year, it said.
The effort to keep economies alive will boost budget deficits in the euro zone to an aggregate 8.5% of GDP this year from 0.6% last year, before the aggregate gap shrinks again to 3.5% in 2021.
A surge in public debt, however, will take longer to undo, the Commission said, forecasting that euro zone debt will jump to 102.7% of GDP this year from 86% last year, and receding only to 98.8% in 2021.
Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal will be among the hardest hit by the economic effects of the pandemic, while Luxembourg, Malta and Austria are to weather the shock better.
Greek GDP is to contract the most, by 9.7%, with Italy recording the second deepest recession of 9.5% and Spain 9.4%.
The budget deficit of Italy, the EU country hardest hit by the coronavirus, will surge the most to 11.1% of GDP this year from 1.6% last year, but will fall back to 5.6% in 2021, the Commission forecast. 
Spain's deficit will just exceed 10% this year, up from 2.8% in 2019 and France will be close behind with a budget gap of 9.9% this year. The Commission expects it to fall to 4.0% next year.

Italy's public debt will also record the biggest increase this year to 158.9% of GDP from 134.8% in 2019. It is seen falling to 153.6% in 2021, the Commission said.

Sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro zone fell by 11.2% in March from February and by 9.2% year-on-year, EU statistics agency Eurostat said on Wednesday.
The declines were sharper than market expectations of 10.5% and 8.0% respectively, according to a Reuters poll of economists.
The month-on-month decline was the steepest in Eurostat data going back to 1999.
The year-on-year figure, which has not been negative since the end of 2013, was the worst on record in data reaching back to 2000. It was also twice as large a decline as in February 2009, the worst month of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
The only brighter spots were a sharp 5.0% month-on-month rise in food sales and a 2.6% increase for mail order and internet shopping. Even pharmaceutical and medical sales dropped, by 0.5%.
The sharpest sales declines were for clothing, footwear and textiles and for automotive fuel.
The steepest national fall was in France at minus 17.4% month-on-month. Luxembourg, Austria and Spain were not far behind. There was no March data for Italy or Greece.

The Office for National Statistics said it had no data on prices in April that account for about 20% of the weighting of its consumer price index.
The items that are now unmeasurable provided a snapshot of what Britons can no longer do under the governments lockdown - manicures, air fares, tickets to the theatre and concerts, hotel stays and driving test fees.
Those prices would be adjusted in line with overall changes in prices that are available, the ONS said.
A further range of prices for goods and services that were available but only in very limited supply would be adjusted in line with similar items, sectoral indexes or the overall index.
Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said it was too soon to say whether the changes would push inflation up or down.
""There might be some unusual movements, either positive or negative,"" he said. ""We are going to be in a situation which is likely to be more volatile than normal.""
The ONS also said coronavirus-related changes to the way it calculates the Retail Price Index, which underpins payments on the country's inflation-linked government bonds, will not require government approval.
The ONS said it had shared its plans with the Bank of England which had determined that the temporary changes did not fundamentally alter the basic RPI calculation and materially hurt index-linked gilt investors.

The AIB IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) forservices fell to 13.9 from 32.5 in March, far below the 50 markthat separates growth from contraction and broadly in line with a flash reading for the euro zone as a whole.
The March reading was already the third-weakest in the survey's 20-year history after a gradual shut down of the economy to slow the spread of the coronavirus from mid-March. The previous record low of 31.8 occurred in February 2009.
All four sub-sectors registered unprecedented contractions in activity in April with two categories -- transport, tourism & leisure and business services –- recording single-digit index readings of 5.2 and 7.4 respectively, the survey's authors said.
With unemployment forecast to hit 25%, Ireland laid out a roadmap on Friday for a steady reopening of the economy that could allow building sites and some retailers to open in two weeks, with restaurants following in June, hotels in July and finally pubs in August.
The services collapse follows a similar record decline for Irish manufacturing. Ireland's finance ministry forecasts a decline of at least 10% in gross domestic product this year.
""The extent of the weakness in April is truly remarkable: 78% of firms reported lower business activity; 80% recorded declines in new orders; over 40% of companies cut staff numbers, while almost 60% saw a decline in order backlogs,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said.
""One glimmer of hope was that business sentiment may be stabilising, with the index for the outlook for the next 12 months falling only slightly after its big plunge in March.""

The headline figure was only slightly higher than a 4.0% jobless rate in the last quarter and lower than forecasts by economists polled by Reuters who predicted a 4.3% increase in the unemployment rate. 
Employment rose 0.7% quarter on quarter, while private sector wages rose 2.5% on the year.
The data reflected the state of the labour market before the five-week alert level 4 lockdown, imposed in New Zealand to stem the spread of COVID-19. The lockdown was eased on April 28 but several restrictions are still in place across the country.
""Any impacts of COVID-19 on jobs are not yet being seen in this employment indicator,"" said Sue Chapman from Statistics New Zealand.
""The lockdown didn’t occur until the last week of March, so we’re expecting limited impact on this month’s numbers.""
New Zealand is expecting hundreds of thousands of job losses in the coming months due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Finance Minister Grant Robertson has said the unemployment rate could be kept below 10%, and return to 5% in 2021 with additional government support.
""Although these data paint a positive picture, the reality is that lives and livelihoods are being significantly affected by the COVID-19 crisis, and the labour market is deteriorating,"" ANZ Senior Economist Liz Kendall said.
The government will announce its annual budget next week while the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) sits on May 13 to decide its monetary policy.

Kendall said more fiscal initiatives can be expected at the budget and RBNZ may double its quantitative easing programme.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit increased by the most in more than a year in March as a record drop in exports offset a shrinking import bill, suggesting the novel coronavirus outbreak was upending the global flow of goods and services.
Other data on Tuesday showed the tough measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, pushed the nation's vast services sector into contraction in April for the first time in nearly 10-1/2-years.
The reports were the latest indication that the economy was sinking deeper into recession and that a sharp rebound was unlikely even as parts of the United States started to reopen.
""Trade between locked-down countries all over the globe will continue to falter in what looks like a second Great Depression and it could be years before the globalization trend reasserts itself as the world grows more cautious during this unprecedented health crisis,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit jumped 11.6%, the largest rise since December 2018, to $44.4 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap increasing to $44.0 billion in March.
Global lockdowns have severely disrupted supply chains and also weighed on demand for goods and services, shrinking economic output. 
In the United States gross domestic product declined at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, the steepest pace of contraction in output since the fourth quarter of 2008. Economists believe the economy entered recession in the second half of March when the social distancing measures took effect.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
Though some parts of the country have started reopening, economists did not see the economy quickly returning to pre-pandemic levels, which they said would take years. Reopening the economy also involves the risk of a second wave of infections and further lockdowns.
A survey on Tuesday from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 41.8 last month, the first contraction since December 2009. It was also the lowest level since March 2009 and followed a reading of 52.5 in March. 
A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry dropped to a record low in April.
""We continue to expect that the apex of the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy occurs this quarter, with GDP falling around 30% at an annualized rate,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors ignored the data, focusing instead on recovering oil prices and an easing of travel restrictions in several countries. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
RECORD EXPORTS PLUNGE
In March, the politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China decreased $4.2 billion to $11.8 billion, a 16-year low. Imports from China fell, while exports to that country rose. 
When adjusted for inflation, the overall goods trade deficit increased $6.5 billion to $75.3 billion in March. Despite's March's increase, the so-called real goods trade deficit narrowed sharply in the first quarter. 
But trade's contribution to first-quarter GDP was offset by a sharp drawdown in inventories as well as weaker consumer spending and business investment because of plunging imports. 
In March, exports dropped a record 9.6% to $187.7 billion, the lowest since November 2016. Goods exports tumbled 6.7%, the most since December 2008, to $128.1 billion. There were decreases in exports of capital goods, which fell $2.0 billion to $42.6 billion, the lowest since November 2016. 
Exports of motor vehicles and parts dropped $2.5 billion to $11.3 billion in March, the weakest since November 2011. Shipments of consumer goods hit a seven-year low in March. Exports of services tumbled $10.8 billion to $59.6 billion, the lowest level since November 2013, hurt by travel restrictions because of COVID-19. 
Imports dropped 6.2% to $232.2 billion, the lowest since November 2016. The percentage decline in imports was the biggest since January 2009. Goods imports fell 2.3% to $193.7 billion in March, the lowest since August 2017.
The import bill has been shrinking as the United States waged a trade war with China. A sharp reduction in crude oil imports has also been a factor, with the United States becoming an oil exporter last year. The country posted a record $2.1 billion petroleum surplus in March.
Tensions have flared up between Washington and Beijing over the origins of the coronavirus, raising fears of an escalation in the trade war between the two economic giants.
In March, imports of automotive vehicles, parts, and engines dropped $2.7 billion to $27.8 billion, the lowest since February 2015. Consumer goods imports decreased $4.0 billion to $47.4 billion, the lowest since April 2016. There was a sharp decline in cellphone imports. 
The petroleum import bill in March was the smallest since May 2016. Imports of services were down $10.7 billion to $38.5 billion in March, the least since August 2013.

""This was a tough report, but is likely only the beginning,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Even as states begin to re-open and factories come back online, trade will remain under pressure.""

Measures of business activity, new orders and employment all fell to record lows last month in figures going back to 1997, according to survey data from the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday. The industries in ISM’s report represent about 90% of the economy.
With similar plunges recorded in ISM’s manufacturing gauges released last week, the figures underscore an economy shrinking at a pace without modern precedent. The group’s gauge of services employment dropped by 17 points to 30 ahead of government figures due Friday that are forecast to show more than 20 million job losses last month.
“I don’t anticipate there will be a V-shaped recovery,” Anthony Nieves, chairman of the group’s non-manufacturing business survey committee, said on a call with reporters.
Readings below 50 indicate shrinking activity, and 16 non-manufacturing industries reported contraction, led by entertainment, agriculture and retail trade.
The ISM’s main, composite non-manufacturing index fell by 10.7 points to an 11-year low of 41.8, compared with the 38 median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The composite gauge reflects a surge in the supplier-delivery index to a record 78.3, indicating longer lead times.
While that usually indicates strains from elevated demand, the deliveries index now reflects virus-related disruptions in supply lines and business closures.

Data firm IHS Markit said last weekarb its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, tumbled to a reading of 27.0 last month. That was the lowest since the series began in late 2009 and followed a flash reading of 27.4 and March's final reading of 40.9. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in private sector output.
Businesses have been pressured by nationwide lockdowns to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, leading to a contraction in the economy.
The government reported last week that gross domestic product declined at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, the steepest pace of contraction in output since the fourth quarter of 2008.
The IHS Markit survey's services sector final Purchasing Managers Index dropped to an all-time low reading of 26.7 in April from a flash reading of 27.0 last month and final 39.8 in March. The data firm confirmed last week that manufacturing activity sank in April to its lowest level since March 2009.
It said new business at private sector firms slumped, as demand fell at the sharpest rate on record. That left greater spare capacity at firms, leading them to reduce their workforce numbers at the steepest rate in the series history.

819,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>",British economy on track for biggest contraction 'in living memory',"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy is on course for an unprecedented 7% quarterly contraction after measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus forced company closures across the country last month, a business survey showed on Tuesday.
Adding to the bleak mood, figures earlier on Tuesday showed monthly car sales had dropped to their lowest since 1946 due to the closure of showrooms, while around a quarter of workers are now on a government-funded furlough.
IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector fell to its lowest since the survey started in 1996, dropping to 13.4 in April from 34.5 in March, only a fraction better than an initial flash estimate of 12.3. 
Last week's manufacturing PMI was similarly dire and IHS Markit said that, taken together, they pointed to the deepest economic downturn ""in living memory"".
A composite PMI of the two sectors dropped to a record-low 13.8 in April from 36.0 in March, far below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction, indicating a 7% quarterly fall in gross domestic product, IHS Markit said.
""We expect the actual decline in GDP could be even greater,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
Britain's services PMI does not include retailers, who have been hardest hit by store closures since the March 23 lockdown, or many of the self-employed.
Howard Archer, economist for forecasters EY ITEM Club, said he expected GDP to fall by around 13% in the second quarter, assuming some lifting of restrictions.
Economies across the world have been battling the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. Flash euro zone PMI data also hit a record low last month, and final figures are due on Wednesday.
Last month, government budget forecasters set out a scenario under which the British economy could contract as much as 35% in the three months to June due to the lockdown, and for annual output to fall by the most in more than 300 years.
UK LOCKDOWN UNDER REVIEW
Britain's government will review the lockdown this week, but so far ministers have said it is too soon to relax restrictions to stem the pandemic that has claimed more than 32,000 lives, according to British data published on Tuesday - surpassing Italy as the worst death toll in Europe.
Britons have been told to stay at home except for exercise, essential shopping, some types of work and a small number of other reasons. The only businesses that reported doing well in the services PMI were those supporting online shopping, government contracts or financial services.
The services PMI showed a small rise in business expectations to 53.2 in April from a record-low 47.9 in March, which IHS Markit said reflected firms' hopes that they would be allowed to reopen by the summer.
""However, service providers looking to re-establish business operations overwhelmingly commented that capacity would remain well below previous levels for an extended period and any timings remain highly uncertain,"" IHS Markit's Moore said.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said there were some signs the worst could be over, based on a recent pick-up in energy usage and the number of people driving further afield, though recovery would be slow.
""With several sectors of the economy set to remain closed for business throughout the summer, and consumers' confidence torn to pieces by COVID-19, we expect only about half of Q2's huge drop in GDP to be reversed in Q3,"" he said.
The government is discussing with company managers and trade unions how to allow more businesses to operate safely.

Under existing guidelines, stores such as supermarkets limit customer numbers and urge staff and shoppers to stay 2 metres apart.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 1.5% month-on-month in March for a 2.8% year-on-year decline.
The former was the steepest decline since November 2008. Economists polled by Reuters had expected drops of 1.3% for the month, and 2.6% year-on-year.
Producer prices show inflationary pressure early in the pipeline because unless their changes are absorbed by retailers and intermediaries, they directly affect the final price for consumers.
Energy prices tumbled 5.5% on the month and by 11.3% year-on-year in March pulled down by the oil-price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia and falling demand for fuel as economies around the world ground to a halt because of the pandemic.
Without the volatile energy component, industrial producer prices fell only 0.2% on the month and were 0.2% higher year-on-year.

Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. Its use is intended to stop immediate shocks such as the coronavirus crisis from turning into mass unemployment.
Unemployment surged in April despite the measure, rising by 373,000 over the course of a single month, with the jobless rate climbing to 5.8% from 5.0%. By April 26, companies had made requests for 10.1 million people to be placed on short-time work.
According to Ifo's survey, 99% of employees were on short time in the catering sector, which has been all but shut down by anti-infection social-distancing measures, and 97% of staff in hotels, which have been hit by the suspension of tourism.
Short-time rates are above 90% in the airline, travel bureau, clothing and leather manufacturing sectors, and above 80% in the creative economy and in gyms and fitness studios.
But other sectors have proven much more resilient: only 30% of staff in the chemicals sectors are on reduced hours, only 21% among food makers, 14% in the healthcare sector, and professional services providers like law firms, tax advisers and auditors had placed only 3% on reduced hours.
Energy providers, sewage management companies and medicine makers had no short-timed staff whatsoever.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, fell to 44.1 in April from 45.2 in March. The 50.0 mark separates expansion from contraction.
The output and new export orders sub-indices fell sharply, both falling to record lows since the survey began in August 2009. Output tumbled to 39.9 in April from 47.2 in March.
""Shop closures and restrictions in domestic and international travel had huge repercussions on new business, which fell at an unprecedented pace after also declining sharply during March,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""Business sentiment reached the lowest in nearly three years, reflecting heightened uncertainty from the COVID-19 crisis. While firms on balance remain optimistic of growth in the coming year, some panelists were apprehensive, noting that the risk of an economic downturn was increasing,"" Owen said.
As of May 3, the UAE had reported 14,163 cases of the novel coronavirus and 126 deaths, the highest number of deaths after Saudi Arabia among the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The authorities have imposed strict lockdown measures to stem the spread of the virus, including a 24-hour curfew in Dubai that was eased in late April as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan began. 
Malls, dine-in restaurants and cafes in Dubai, the country's business and tourism hub, were allowed to resume operations with limited capacity. This week, malls in the capital Abu Dhabi began to reopen and Sharjah followed.
But travel, tourism and trade, major contributors to the economy, both remain largely at a halt.
""Tourism declined sharply again, as countries worldwide imposed similar restrictions amid the virus pandemic. Along with reduced demand from foreign clients, this led to a steep fall in export business, one that was unprecedented in the survey history,"" the report said.

New export orders fell to 35.2 in April from 44.3 in March.

Lockdown measures have been in place across Europe since mid-March to contain the pandemic, leading to the closure of many businesses and limiting people's movements.
In February 1946, just a few months after the end of World War Two, just 4,044 new cars were sold in Britain, which was still undergoing rationing and trying to rebuild after wartime destruction, under its first majority Labour government.

The Confederation of British Industry said smaller manufacturers had already suffered the largest drop in output and the biggest quarterly loss in jobs since the financial crisis during the three months to April.
""SME manufacturers are seeing a sharp shock to activity due to the COVID-19 outbreak, with expectations signalling a sharper downturn to come,"" CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said.
Last week a monthly survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector showed the biggest fall in output in April since the survey began in 1992.
The CBI said its members' expectations for factory output over the next three months were the weakest since its survey started in 1988.
Total economic output could fall by more than a third during the second quarter - a drop with no precedent in more than 300 years - according to a scenario published by the government's budget forecasters last month.
Britain's government is due to review the lockdown this week. But so far ministers have said there are no grounds for a significant relaxation yet, as the official death toll approaches 30,000, the highest in Europe alongside Italy.
The CBI conducted its survey of 301 small manufacturers from March 25 to April 14. Britain's lockdown began on March 23, and has closed most non-essential businesses to the public, though not to staff if they can keep a safe distance while working.

828,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>","Pandemic slams global factories, activity sinks to new lows","By Jonathan Cable and Sam Holmes
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Factory activity was ravaged across the world in April, business surveys showed, and the outlook looked bleak as government lockdowns to contain the new coronavirus pandemic froze global production and slashed demand.
The coronavirus has infected more than 3.5 million people globally and killed around 247,000. With the public told to stay home in numerous countries, the global economy is expected to suffer its steepest contraction on record this year as supply chains have been massively disrupted. 
In a bid to combat the impact of the lockdowns, central banks and governments have unleashed unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary policy, suggesting that without this conditions could have been even worse.
Still, a series of Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMIs) from IHS Markit across Europe and Asia fell deeper into contraction last month, with many diving to all-time lows and others hitting levels last not seen since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.
A gauge from the United States published on Friday showed manufacturing activity plunged to an 11-year low in April as the coronavirus wreaked havoc, suggesting the world's largest economy was sinking deeper into recession.
On Monday, IHS Markit's final manufacturing PMI for the euro zone sank to 33.4, its lowest since the survey began in mid-1997 and far beneath the 50-point line dividing growth from contraction.
With shops closed and consumers concerned about their health and employment prospects, demand sank in the bloc to by far the lowest in the survey's history, giving scant hope for an imminent turnaround.
It was a similar story from Britain on Friday when its PMI showed manufacturers there suffered their biggest fall in output and orders for at least three decades.
""This past week saw the amazing coincidence of the publication of the deepest quarterly economic decline in the Western world in almost 100 years and the conclusion to the strongest monthly equity rally in more than 30 years,"" said Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit.
But European stock markets and oil prices fell on Monday as a spat between top U.S. officials and China over the origin of the coronavirus fuelled fears of a renewed trade war that might derail or delay a swift rebound. 
Asian PMIs also suffered, with South Korea, the continent's fourth-largest economy and a global manufacturing powerhouse, skidding last month to its lowest reading since January 2009. Japan's PMI released last week similarly fell to an 11-year low.
""Regional PMI manufacturing data kicked off the data dump on Monday, with economies registering deep contractions with most countries employing some form of lockdown,"" said Prakash Sakpal, Asia Economist at ING.
""Economic data should remind investors of the bleak economic situation ahead even as governments from previous hotspots ready the gradual reopening of their economies.""
Last week, China's official PMI showed factory activity still growing in April, albeit more slowly than March, while the private-sector Caixin PMI showed a dip into contraction, although at a much gentler pace than the rest of the world. Significantly, exporters in both surveys were jolted by steep falls in orders.
While China appears to be ahead of others in emerging from the economic paralysis inflicted by the pandemic, any recovery is expected to be gradual and unlikely to fire up an immediate resurgence in global demand.
The PMI for Taiwan, a major producer of high-end technology components, fell to 42.2, its lowest since 2009 and down from an expansionary 50.4 in March.
The declines in South Korea's and Taiwan's PMIs showed the contractions were less severe than those in other economies in the region, with indicators in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam all reporting plunges to record lows.
Capital Economics said while South Korea and Taiwan held up better than their Southeast Asian counterparts, thanks mostly to effective government policies to contain the virus, conditions have nonetheless worsened.
Official data released last week showed the coronavirus sent South Korean exports plunging in April at their sharpest pace since the global financial crisis.
South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd last week said it expected profits to decline in the current quarter due to a slump in sales.
It said while work-from-home orders and growth in online learning would underpin demand for memory chips, the outlook for smartphones and TVs was bleak as consumers put off discretionary spending.
The production slump is of particular concern to policymakers, who are worried about the socially destabilising effects of massive unemployment as firms in both factory and service sectors slash headcount.

A private-sector survey in Australia on Monday showed job advertisements plunging a record 53.1% in April, a decline almost five times larger than the previous record of 11.3% in January 2009.

830,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone manufacturing collapses in April as virus spreads: PMI,"LONDON (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in the euro zone collapsed last month as government-imposed lockdowns to stop the spread of the new coronavirus forced factories to close and consumers to stay indoors, a survey showed on Monday.
The coronavirus has infected more than 3.5 million people globally and killed around 247,000 so with citizens told to stay at home economic activity has plummeted and supply chains have been massively disrupted.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone sank to 33.4 from March's 44.5, its lowest since the survey began in mid-1997, below an earlier flash reading of 33.6 and significantly below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and seen as good indicator of economic health, sank to a survey low of 18.1 from 38.5.
""Euro area manufacturing output plunged to an extent greatly exceeding any decline previously seen in the near 23-year history of the PMI survey in April, reflecting a combination of factors including widespread factory closures, slumping demand and supply shortages, all linked to the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
The slump came despite the European Central Bank easing policy and ramping up its quantitative easing programme alongside unprecedented amounts of fiscal stimulus from governments to help an economy ravaged by the pandemic.
With shops closed and consumers concerned about their health and employment prospects, demand sank last month to by far the lowest in the survey's history. The new orders PMI came in at 18.8, almost half March's already weak reading of 37.5.
Scant demand forced factories to cut prices, reduce headcount at one of the sharpest rates on record and complete backlogs of work to stay active. Unsurprisingly, optimism was at a survey low.
While some countries have begun to ease lockdown measures, offering some hope for a rebound this month, IHS Markit cautioned any pick up would be modest.

""Steps needed to keep workers safe will mean even businesses that are able to restart production will generally be running at low capacity, and most will be operating in an environment of greatly reduced demand,"" Williamson said.

831,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>",German manufacturing output posts record contraction in April: PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German factory output shrank at the fastest rate on record in April and firms in the export-oriented sector cut jobs at the fastest pace in almost 11 years, a survey showed on Monday, as the new coronavirus crushed demand.
That sent IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing - which accounts for about a fifth of Europe's largest economy - falling to 34.5, the lowest reading since March 2009, from 45.4 in March. The final figure was up from an initial flash reading of 34.4.
""Output nosedived as large numbers of manufacturers either temporarily closed factories or cut working hours amid a collapse in export demand across Europe and the United States, and mounting supply chain challenges,"" said Phil Smith, principle economist at IHS Markit.
""Even as more manufacturers start to come back on stream, there are still some huge question marks, like what kind of demand conditions are they returning to, and for how long will supply chains be impacted,"" he added.
Companies in Germany have been closing facilities and switching workers to shorter hours under a government scheme aimed at avoiding mass layoffs.
The survey showed that even this scheme, to which 750,000 had applied by April 13 and which had helped Germany weather the 2008 financial crisis, had failed to slow the pace of job cuts, the survey showed.
As output fell at the fastest rate in the data series going back to early 1996, manufacturers cut jobs at the fastest pace since May 2009.
Smith said German manufacturers expect disruption to supply and demand to continue long into this year at least, dimming the chance of a speedy recovery.

""Given such a challenging outlook, job cuts have continued to gather pace despite the widespread uptake of the short-time working scheme, thus raising the chances of a more protracted recovery,"" he said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index dropped to 31.5 in April from 43.2 in March, in line with a preliminary reading.
The freefall plunged the index to its lowest level since records began in 1998, far below the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
France has been under lockdown orders banning non-essential activities since mid-March. The prospect of a gradual unwinding from May 11 is offering little relief to firms expecting a long slog back to work.
""Firms were severely pessimistic towards the business outlook,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""Caution around a second outbreak will likely limit the speed at which normality is resumed, and we can therefore expect any recovery to be drawn out,"" he added.
Executives polled by IHS Markit said they were reducing staff headcount at the fastest pace on record as new orders had all but dried up.

The economy suffered its deepest slump on records going back to 1949 in the first quarter, contracting 5.8% from the previous three months, the INSEE stats agency said on Thursday.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of manufacturing companies sank to 30.8 in April from 45.7 in March, the biggest drop in one month since the records started in February 1998.
Restrictions on non-essential economic activity in Spain and around the globe sparked record falls in production, new orders and exports in April, the survey showed.
""Records were broken across a number of data points ... but perhaps most worrying are developments in confidence and employment,"" IHS Markit Economics Director Paul Smith said.
""Job losses occurred at a rate surpassed only during the heights of the financial crisis as firms signalled notable worries about the longer-term impact of the pandemic on demand. This leads to concerns that when the recovery out of the lockdown begins, it may prove to be much more arduous than the hoped-for swift return to pre-crisis activity levels"", he added.
Spain is starting to ease its lockdown after suffering one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks. Its economy shrank by the widest margin on record in the first quarter.

837,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing activity plunges to 11-year low as orders sink,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity plunged to an 11-year low in April as the novel coronavirus wreaked havoc on supply chains, suggesting the economy was sinking deeper into recession.
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday added to a raft of grim data this week, including a collapse in consumer spending in March and a surge to 30.3 million in the number of Americans who have filed claims for unemployment benefits in the last six weeks. 
Strict measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, have almost paralyzed the country, leading to the deepest economic contraction since the Great Recession in the first quarter.
""The backdrop for manufacturers is very bleak, with collapsing global demand, ongoing supply chain disruptions, and high levels of uncertainty all posing very significant challenges,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We do not expect output losses to be recouped until 2021.""
The ISM said its index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 41.5 last month, the lowest level since April 2009, from 49.1 in March. The monthly decline in the ISM index was the biggest since October 2008. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would fall to 36.9 in April. The smaller-than-expected drop in the ISM index was attributable to a surge in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 76.0 last month from 65.0 in March.
A lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution. But in this case slower supplier deliveries indicate supply shortages related to the coronavirus pandemic, and not stronger demand.
Even with some parts of the country starting to reopen, economists do not expect a rapid reversal in the economic downturn, with some small businesses expected to go under. There is also a risk of a second wave of COVID-19 infections.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower amid the rising tide of weak economic reports and President Donald Trump's threats to slap new tariffs on China over the coronavirus crisis. The dollar was slightly lower against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
RECESSION TERRITORY
Last month's decrease in the ISM index pulled it below the 42.8 threshold. A reading above this level over a long period of time is associated with economic expansion. 
Economists believe the economy entered recession in mid-March when state and local government enforced ""stay-at-home"" orders for non-essential workers.
The rule of thumb in many countries is to define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, but the National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not use that definition.
Instead, it looks for a decline in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
""The ISM manufacturing survey has come late to the recession forecasting party this time, as this recession is the quickest deterioration in economic activity ever recorded,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The ISM said comments from manufacturers were ""strongly negative regarding the near-term outlook, with sentiment clearly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and continuing energy market recession."" COVID-19 lockdowns have weighed on demand for oil, sending crude prices crashing.
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index tumbled to a reading of 27.1 in April, the lowest since December 2008, from 42.2 in March. The monthly decline was the largest since April 1951. Out of the 18 industries, only manufacturers of paper and food, beverage and tobacco products reported increases in orders. This is consistent with shortages of some foodstuffs and paper products like toilet paper.
The survey's measure of order backlogs at factories plummeted to 37.8 last month from 45.9 in March.
With orders collapsing, manufacturers slashed payrolls last month. The ISM's factory employment index plunged to a reading of 27.5 last month, the lowest since February 1949, from 43.8 in March. The monthly decrease in the employment measure was the largest since the ISM started tracking the series in 1948.
This fits in with economists' expectations that the government's closely watched employment report next Friday will show a record more than 20 million people lost their jobs in April, with the unemployment rate blowing past the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982. 
In March the jobless rate shot up 0.9 percentage point, the largest monthly change since January 1975, to 4.4%. 

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed construction spending rebounded 0.9% in March, with gains in private and public outlays, after declining 2.5% in February. The report, however, likely does not fully capture the coronavirus-related business closures and disruptions that swept through the country beginning in mid-March.

Data firm IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO) said its final U.S. manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index dropped to a reading of 36.1 last month, the lowest reading since March 2009. That was a downward revision from the 'flash' figure of 36.9 reported last week and lower than 48.5 published in March. 
A PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of economic activity. IHS Markit said the deterioration in factory activity was ""overwhelmingly"" linked to lockdowns by state and local authorities to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. 
The survey's measure of new orders received by factories tumbled in April at its fastest rate since January 2009. The data firm said there were reports of customers canceling or postponing orders. New export orders also tumbled in April.
Manufacturers cut their workforce numbers at the sharpest pace since March 2009. Many manufacturers reported furloughing workers. Others said it was no longer viable to retain staff. 
According to IHS Markit uncertainty and fear surrounding the longevity of the social distancing measures had led to business confidence slumping to a series low in April. 

It said manufacturers were pessimistic regarding the outlook for output over the coming year on average for the first time since the data firm started tracking responses in July 2012.

839,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","As U.S. jobless claims surged in March, some states lagged with payments","By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) - Fewer than one in five Americans who filed for unemployment benefits in March received their first payments before the month was over, shedding light on how states struggled to distribute initial benefits after facing an unprecedented wave of claims caused by the coronavirus.
Nationally, just 14.21% of the nearly 12 million people who filed initial jobless claims in March received their first payments that same month, according to Labor Department data released this week.
In some states, the share of people receiving benefits was significantly lower, showing that newly jobless Americans in some parts of the country are facing much longer waits for benefits than others.
""They are struggling with the demand and that is very frustrating to people,"" said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, which published an analysis on the state trends on Wednesday. ""This data gives you a sense of it.""
Under federal rules, states have up to three weeks to make initial payments from the time a claim is filed, Stettner said. Since many states did not put lockdowns or stay-at-home orders in place until mid- to late March, it's possible some states caught up with payments in April. 
In Indiana, Arizona, Minnesota and Florida, less than 3% of people filing claims for the first time in March had received payments that month, which could cause them to understate the number of jobless people in the state by some estimates.
Rhode Island, in contrast, paid benefits to 51% of the 60,000 people who filed initial jobless claims in March. West Virginia and Virginia were close behind, paying benefits to about half of workers who filed claims.
More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since March 21. The sheer volume of claims has overwhelmed some state filing systems, which were not built to process such a high volume of applications. 
(Graphic: Unemployment rolls surge in many states - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlgxnrpb/Pasted%20image%201588276517253.png) 
State labor departments are hiring additional staff to help process claims and answer questions. States are also revamping their websites and trying to manage the traffic by asking people to file claims on certain days of the week based on their names. 
Still, a survey by the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that for every 10 people who have successfully filed unemployment claims, three or four people have been unable to register and another two people have not tried to apply. 
In recent years, several states have cut unemployment benefits and made it more difficult for people to apply. ""They've been more throwing up barriers to people getting assistance,"" said Stettner. 
Other factors may also be at play. For example, some states with smaller populations, such as Rhode Island, may have an easier time processing claims than states with more people, he said.
The states that are having trouble processing claims may also be undercounting the number of people who have lost jobs, by some measures. Consider the insured unemployment rate, which measures what share of the total labor force is receiving unemployment benefits. 
Florida, for example, had an insured unemployment rate of 2% as of mid-April, but it was also severely behind in processing claims as of March - making payments to only 2.4% of people who filed initial claims that month. Rhode Island, which paid benefits to more than half of people filing claims in March, had a higher insured unemployment rate of nearly 17%.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers suffered the biggest fall in output and orders for at least three decades in April, as measures to slow the spread of the new coronavirus sent the economy into a steep downturn, a survey showed on Friday.
April's final IHS Markit/CIPS Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) confirmed the bleak picture painted in a flash estimate released on April 23.
The headline activity index fell to a record-low 32.6 from March's 47.8, broadly in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll and the earlier flash estimate of 32.9.
""Huge swathes of industry were hit hard by company closures, weak global demand, lockdowns and social distancing measures in response to COVID-19. The only pockets of growth were seen at firms making medical and food products,"" said Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO), which compiles the survey.
The output component - which IHS Markit says gives a more accurate picture of the scale of the decline - plummeted to an all-time low of 16.3 from 43.9 the month before. Numbers below 50 represent a fall in output at a majority of manufacturers.
Earlier on Friday, trade body Make UK said it feared factory output could more than halve during the current quarter, and said more than 80% of its members had suffered a fall in orders.
A separate survey from the Confederation of British Industry showed that in the three months to April private-sector activity dropped by the most since July 2009.
Britain's economy went into lockdown on March 23. Although people may still travel to work if they cannot work from home, factories have struggled with a general fall in demand.
IHS Markit said the fall in factory orders in April was the biggest since its survey began in 1992.
Total economic output could fall by more than a third during the second quarter - a drop with no precedent in modern times - according to a scenario published by the government's budget forecasters last month.
Britain's government is due to review the lockdown next week. But so far ministers have said there are no grounds for a relaxation yet, as the official death toll nears 30,000.
""The outstanding question remains how long the current restrictions will need to remain in place, and which sectors can start to safely reopen,"" Dobson said.

""The pressure is mounting, as the longer the global economy remains in lockdown the greater the cost to industry will grow, and the greater the likelihood that more jobs will be cut.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Consumer prices in Japan's capital city fell for the first time in three years in April and national factory activity slumped, data showed on Friday, increasing worries the coronavirus pandemic could tip the country back into deflation.
The darkening outlook in the world's third-largest economy is already heightening calls for bigger spending, even after parliament approved an extra budget to fund a $1.1 trillion stimulus package to cushion the blow from the pandemic.
""The government will work with the central bank to ensure Japan absolutely does not slip back into deflation,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told a news conference on Friday.
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide inflation trends, slipped 0.1% in April from a year earlier, government data showed, dashing expectations for a 0.1% rise and following a 0.4% increase in March.
It was the first year-on-year decline since April 2017.
While the drop was largely due to slumping energy costs following the collapse in the crude oil price, it has consolidated expectations that Japan will see consumer prices fall in coming months as the economy feels a sharper hit from the pandemic.
A separate business survey on Friday confirmed Japan's factory activity shrank at its fastest pace in more than a decade in April, as the coronavirus hurt output and new orders.
AN OLD FOE
Japan suffered nearly two decades of deflation - or sustained periods of price declines - until 2013, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies helped revive parts of the economy out of the doldrums.
Abe has touted an end to deflation as among key successes of his policies, which included bold monetary easing undertaken by his hand-picked Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
But the coronavirus pandemic has taken a heavy economic toll and stoked fears of a return to falling prices.
Many analysts believe Japan is already deep in recession as government requests for citizens to stay home and businesses to shut down chill consumption, while similar curbs elsewhere have triggered a collapse in global trade.
""A sharp deterioration in Japan's economy is unavoidable, as domestic demand plunges,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Analysts expect an economic contraction in the current quarter to be larger than the 17.8% decline in the first quarter of 2009, during the global financial crisis.
The median forecast for Japan's April-June gross domestic product (GDP) is for a 22.0% fall, a Reuters poll of 18 economists showed. That would follow an expected 4.5% first-quarter decline. Japan releases preliminary first-quarter GDP data on May 18.
Household spending data released on May 8 is expected to show a 6.7% decline in March from a year earlier, a separate Reuters poll showed.
The dismal projections have loudened calls for policymakers to ramp up already massive fiscal and monetary support.
The BOJ boosted monetary stimulus at its policy meeting this week and pledged to flood more money into the ailing economy.
Minutes of the BOJ's March rate review showed board members voicing concerns about a cash squeeze for small firms, spiking unemployment and a slump in business spending.
""It's uncertain whether Japan's economy can make a strong rebound even after the pandemic is contained,"" several BOJ board members were quoted as saying at the March meeting.
Kuroda said on Thursday the BOJ may hold an emergency meeting before a scheduled rate review in June to set up incentives for financial institutions that boost lending to small firms.
Japan is expected to extend its state of emergency for containing the coronavirus, public broadcaster NHK reported, even as other countries reopen.

Japan has had more than 14,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 455 deaths, according to an NHK tally.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis sent South Korean exports plunging in April at their sharpest pace since the global financial crisis, signalling a bleak outlook for international trade as the pandemic paralyses the world economy and shatters demand.
Exports dived 24.3% year-on-year in April, trade ministry data showed on Friday, the worst contraction since May 2009 but slightly slower than a 25.4% fall tipped in a Reuters survey. It slid 0.7% in the previous month.
The average exports per working day, excluding the calendar effect, however, tumbled 17.4%, far worse than a 6.9% fall seen in March.
South Korea, Asia's fourth-largest economy, is considered a bellwether for world trade and is the first among major exporting economies to release data on shipments. 
The grim numbers underline the sweeping impact of the pandemic and points to a rough period for international trade as factories struggle amid collapsing global demand. On Thursday, factory surveys for China, the world's biggest exporter, showed plummeting export orders. 
""May will be extremely difficult for South Korea's exports. We could potentially see the dip in shipments bottoming out in May should the U.S. and Europe begin to normalise their economies,"" said Park Sang-hyun, Chief Economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
""I cautiously expect exports to fall at a slower rate from June, especially on more stimulus from China and as oil prices recover, which should help boost Korea's petrochemical products.""
A breakdown of the trade data showed overseas sales of the country's top income earner semiconductors tumbled 14.9%, while those of oil products, car components and wireless devices plummeted 56.8%, 49.6% and 33.4%, respectively.
By destination, shipments to the biggest trading partner China fell 17.9%, even as factories there resumed operations, while those to the United States and the European Union also slumped 13.5% and 12.8% each.
Imports dropped 15.9% in April, reversing a 0.3% gain in the previous month and pushing the trade balance into a $0.95 billion deficit, its first trade gap since January 2012.
'DREADFUL YEAR' 
More than 3.21 million people have been infected across the world, according to a Reuters tally, with nationwide infections in South Korea surpassing 10,700.
The virus pushed the South Korea's economy into its biggest contraction since 2008 in the first quarter, while the business outlook slumped to the worst on record.
Many expect the economy to shrink this year, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) now seeing a 1.2% contraction.
Hobbled by coronavirus, its two biggest trading partners, the United States and China saw their economies contract sharply in the first quarter, suggesting a painfully slow path to recovery for global trade.
Months of pandemic lockdowns across the United States and Europe brought factories to a screeching halt, causing unprecedented disruptions for many Korean businesses including the nation's global-trotting tech titans.
Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) on Wednesday joined other tech giants such as SK Hynix (KS:000660) in declining to provide annual forecasts because of uncertainty about the pandemic but said it expected profit to decline in the second quarter due to slumping sales of smartphones and TVs.
In a recent note to clients, Capital Economics forecast global trade volumes will tumble 20% in 2020, saying it will be ""a dreadful year"" as major economies struggle to recover from the pandemic. 
South Korea has pledged stimulus totalling about 240 trillion won ($196.73 billion) to tackle the economic slowdown, while markets are betting the Bank of Korea could ease again in coming months.

The BOK cut rates by 50 basis points March - the largest policy easing since the global financial crisis. The bank next reviews its policy on May 28.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 08:35PM ET</span>",Japan's April factory activity shrinks at fastest pace in 11 years: final PMI,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory activity shrank faster than initially estimated in April, a manufacturing survey showed on Friday, as the coronavirus hit to the economy deepened, with declines in product orders and output accelerating.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 41.9 from a final 44.8 in March, its lowest since April 2009, and showing a steeper contraction than the 43.7 seen in a preliminary reading last week.
The decline in activity bodes ill for the world's third-largest economy, which faces a prolonged downturn due to its export dependence and fragile domestic consumption.
The survey showed both output and new orders contracted at the fastest pace since early 2009, as the pandemic knocked overseas and domestic demand, setting off orders cancellations and factory closures.
""Japan's manufacturing downturn deepened in April as international supply chain paralysis intensified and global demand sank further,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO), which compiled the survey.
""Factory shutdowns and below-capacity operations overseas are having a cascading effect on Japanese goods producers, who in turn are cutting or completely suspending production due to closures at their clients and suppliers.""
Employment conditions at manufacturers worsened for a second month during April, with the rate of decline accelerating to the fastest in more than a decade.
They also reported the most negative outlook for output over the next 12 months since IHS Markit started tracking the future outlook in July 2012. Firms said they expect to adjust their production schedules over the coming year in response to falling demand.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government last week expanded its spending package to a record $1.1 trillion yen to include cash payouts to every citizen, as the coronavirus outbreak threatens to hit broad parts of the economy.

The economy shrank an annualised 7.1% in the final quarter of last year due to the blow from the U.S.-China trade war and last October's sales tax hike.

Make UK said a survey of 297 members, conducted from April 20-27, showed that more than three quarters had already suffered a drop in sales.
Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility said on April 14 that factory output could fall by 55% in the second quarter, as part of a scenario for the broader economy that showed a 35% plunge in total output if lockdown restrictions stay in place. 
""The extent of the collapse in demand is such it means that the recent OBR forecast could be an underestimate unless there is a quite remarkable turnaround which, to be frank, just isn't going to happen,"" Make UK chief executive Stephen Phipson said.
A separate survey from the Confederation of British Industry showed that private-sector activity fell by the most since July 2009 during the three months to April, and that output expectations were the weakest on record.
Britain's government ordered non-essential businesses to close to the public on March 23 and urged staff to work from home if possible. It is due to review the measures on May 7 but officials have said it is too soon for a major easing.
Some 87% of manufacturers are still carrying out some operations, but more than a third had put staff members on leave under a government wage guarantee scheme which was likely to be needed beyond its planned end-June closing date, Make UK said. 
One in five manufacturers have seen orders drop by more than half, it added.
A survey by Britain's statistics office published on Thursday showed that across the economy as a whole, one in four businesses reported sales had dropped by more than half during the April 6-19 period.

Last week, flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for April showed the sharpest fall in factory output since that survey began in 1992.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, tumbled 7.5% last month after rising 0.2% in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending falling 5.0% in March.

The drop was more than three times larger than the previous record decline of 2.1% in January 1987. The Commerce Department began tracking the data in 1959.

Household outlays, which account for about two-thirds of the economy, plunged 7.5% from the prior month, the sharpest drop in Commerce Department records back to 1959, data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 5.1% slump. Incomes declined 2%.
The numbers are the latest tally of how the shutdown was bearing down on a U.S. economy that’s all but officially in a recession. Stay-at-home orders across the country kept consumers from spending at restaurants, bars and retail shops. Shuttered businesses left millions of Americans without a paycheck to spend, leaving them dependent on government assistance.
After adjusting for inflation, spending slumped 7.3%, also the most ever and underscoring data out Wednesday that showed the sharpest drop in consumer spending since 1980 during the first quarter. Spending on durable goods slid 14.8%, while outlays for services slumped 9.5%.
The report also showed nominal incomes dropped the most since January 2013. reflecting a 3.1% decrease in wages and salaries that may reflect reduced hours or other pay cuts seen as a result of the pandemic.
Meantime, income payments through the government’s unemployment insurance program jumped 39.1% as more than 10 million people filed for jobless benefits in the month. A separate report Thursday showed another 3.8 million people filed initial jobless claims in the week ended April 25.
Inflation data included with the income and spending report showed that the Federal Reserve’s preferred core price gauge fell 0.1% from the prior month and rose 1.7% annually. The broader personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Fed officially targets for 2% inflation, rose 1.3% from a year earlier.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits decreased to 3.83 million in the week ending April 25, the U.S. Labor Department said Thursday, as the economy continues to reel from nationwide lockdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
Continuing claims, which record the number of people already receiving benefits jumped to a record 17.99 million in the week ending April 18, the report said, up from 15.81 million a week earlier. Continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag.
Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected initial jobless claims to fall to 3.5 million and continuing claims to rise to 19.2 million.
The number of weekly claims has been moving lower since hitting a record 6.8 million in the week ended March 28, as overwhelmed state employment offices cleared backlogs.
With initial claims for jobless benefits starting to stabilize, attention is shifting to the number of people remaining on unemployment benefits to get a better sense of the depth of the labor market downturn.
The figures come one day after a report showing the U.S. economy contracted at an 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter, ending the longest expansion in U.S. history.
The Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero after its meeting on Wednesday and promised to expand emergency programs as needed to help the struggling economy.and repeated a vow to use its ""full range of tools"" amid what it now says are ""considerable risks"" over the medium term, perhaps a year or more."

849,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 06:01AM ET</span>",Spain's ravaged economy suffers worst quarterly contraction on record,"By Belén Carreño and Isla Binnie
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's economy shrunk by its biggest amount on record, 5.2%, in the first three months of 2020 due to the crippling impact of the coronavirus crisis, preliminary data showed on Thursday.
The National Statistics Institute's figure was the worst since the historical series began in 1970 and exceeded analysts' forecasts of a 4.4% contraction versus the previous quarter.
Spain has had one of the world's worst outbreaks with more than 24,000 COVID-19 fatalities and in mid-March imposed one of the strictest lockdowns, though officials are confident the worst has passed and want to start easing measures next month.
With the second quarter likely to be even more painful, the central bank predicts the tourism-dependent economy could shrink as much as 12.4% this year though it also foresees a recovery of at least 5.5% in 2021.
The government has until Thursday night to send its own forecasts for the year to the European Union (EU). 
With the economy in hibernation since a March 14 lockdown, Spain had already registered another record for its economy of losing nearly 900,000 jobs in the second half of that month.
Beaches and hotels lie empty in a tourism sector that normally accounts for 12% of gross domestic product. Another big driver, the real estate market, is at a standstill.
On an annual basis, Spain's economy shrank by 4.1% in the first quarter, down from a 1.8% increase in the previous three-month period, versus economists' expectations of a 3.2% contraction. 
CONSTRUCTION PUMMELLED
Household spending plunged 7.5% in the first quarter compared to the previous period.
Unlike private consumption, public spending is one of the few areas growing, up 1.8%, amid heavy state intervention to combat the coronavirus. 
The construction sector, which was particularly hard hit during the 2008 financial crisis, had begun to recover in recent years, but saw investment fall by 9.6% in the first three months of the year, more than any other area.
The retail, transport and hotel sector contracted by 11% in the first quarter, a figure never before seen in Spain's economy. 
""This crisis will be worse for hotel workers than 2009 was for construction. At least then we still had tourism,"" said Francisco Rullan, who works at a hotel in Mallorca.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government is calling for a national pact between political parties and other stakeholders to decide on a recovery plan.
""In order to try to avoid further falls, it's necessary to agree on a plan to rebuild the Spanish economy,"" Transport Ministry José Luis Ábalos told Cadena SER radio.
Gonzalo Gortazar, chief executive of Spain's third largest bank  Caixabank SA  (MC:CABK), said the second quarter was looking even worse for the economy given more weeks of lockdown. 

""At the end of the second quarter, depending on the calendar for easing the lockdown, we should start to grow but it would be gradual, I am afraid,"" he said on a media briefing.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The eurozone economy contracted at a record rate and by more than expected in the first three months of the year and inflation slowed sharply as much economic activity in March came to a halt because of the COVID-19 pandemic, data showed on Thursday.
According to a preliminary flash estimate of the European Union's statistics office Eurostat economic output in the 19 countries sharing the euro in January-March was 3.8% smaller than in the previous three months -- the sharpest quarterly decline since the time series started in 1995. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 3.5% contraction after a 0.1% quarterly growth in the last three months of 2019.
Year-on-year the gross domestic product contraction was 3.3% in the first quarter.
Eurostat also said consumer prices in the euro zone grew 0.3% month-on-month in April for a 0.4% year-on-year increase, slowing from 0.7% year-on-year in March.
But the slowdown of inflation was smaller than expected by economists, who on average forecast a deceleration to 0.1% year-on-year in Aril, according to a Reuters poll.
The biggest drag on the overall index cam from energy prices, which dropped 9.6% year-on-year. 
Without the volatile energy and unprocessed food components - what the European Central Bank calls core inflation - prices grew 0.7% on the month for a 1.1% year-on-year increase. In March this measures was an increase of 1.2% percent. 
An even narrower measure of inflation that excludes also alcohol and tobacco prices and is followed by many market economists showed prices going up 0.8% on the month in April and 0.9% year-on-year, against a 1.0% annual increase in March.

Separately, Eurostat said euro zone unemployment, a lagging indicator which reflect changes in the economy with a delay, ticked up to 7.4% of the workforce in March from 7.3% in February.

PARIS (Reuters) - France suffered its sharpest economic contraction since records began in 1949 in the first quarter, as a coronavirus lockdown from mid-March left shops shuttered and consumers hunkered down at home, data showed on Thursday.
With the curbs on activity set to run at least until May 11, economists said the first quarter plunge was only the beginning of a downward spiral and there would be a long, painful slog to recover lost ground.
Gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 5.8% from the previous three months, the INSEE official statistics agency said. That marked the second consecutive quarter of contraction, putting the economy technically into recession. 
The slump was the deepest on a quarterly basis since World War Two.
It surpassed economists' average expectation of 3.5% in a Reuters poll, and the 5.3% of the second quarter of 1968, when France was gripped by civil unrest, mass student protests and general strikes.
Since March 17, France's 67 million people have been ordered to stay at home except to buy food, go to work, seek medical care or get some exercise on their own. 
INSEE said consumer spending, usually the driver of the French economy, dropped 6.1% in the first quarter from the previous three months while business investment plunged 11.4%.
The lockdown is due to begin winding down from May 11, but the government has said that bankruptcies and unemployment are likely to rise steeply in its wake.
French credit insurer Euler Hermes said in a research note it expected GDP to shrink 16% quarter on quarter in the three months to June.
Highlighting the immediate impact of the lockdown, INSEE said in a separate release that consumer spending plunged nearly 18% in March from February with manufactured goods down 42%.
The government expects the economy will contract at least 8% this year and has rushed through a crisis package worth 110 billion euros - 4% of GDP - to help companies and workers.
More than one in two private sector workers has been put on state-subsidised furloughs aimed at staving off permanent mass layoffs.

Euler Hermes forecast a full-year GDP contraction of nearly 9% on the expectation that activity would resume only gradually, with manufacturing and construction reaching pre-crisis activity levels at year-end while services would remain below that until the second quarter of 2021.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",Taiwan first-quarter GDP slows to four-year low as pandemic hurts exports,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's economic growth in the first quarter slowed to its weakest in nearly four years, as fallout from the coronavirus pandemic hurts the electronics exports which are pivotal to its trade-reliant economy. 
The government has warned of slowing demand for the island's export orders in the coming months due to the impact from the virus, and is rolling out an economic stimulus package expected to be eventually worth T$1.05 trillion ($35 billion). 
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 1.54% in the January-March period from a year earlier, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Thursday, down from 3.31% in the fourth quarter. 
Growth in the first quarter was the slowest since a contraction of 0.09% in the first quarter of 2016 and slightly lagged an economists' forecast of 1.6% in a Reuters poll.
The virus hit consumer spending in the first three months of the year, including the impact from a more than 50% drop in the number of foreign tourists to Taiwan, the agency said.
The effect from the virus and interrupted supply chains was offset by a ""significant boost in domestic production"" for products including semiconductors and telecommunications, it added.While Taiwan has not gone into total lockdown to contain the spread of the virus thanks to relatively successful measures that prevented a rapid spread of the disease, the government has repeatedly warned of uncertainty for the economy. Earlier this month, it downgraded its growth forecast for this year to between 1.3% and 1.8%, from 2.37% in February.
Some analysts, however, said Taiwan's success at containing the pandemic will not help avert a recession in 2020, citing a hard hit on the island's domestic consumption and job market due to a collapse in global demand for its exports, which contributed to more than 60% of its GDP.
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's on Wednesday projected Taiwan's economy would contract 1.2% in 2020, before rebounding by 4% in 2021, citing the temporary nature of the impact from the coronavirus pandemic. 
""As the outbreak recedes, we expect a strong economic recovery on the back of Taiwan's dynamic and highly competitive electronics manufacturing sector,"" it said.
Still, in a sign of the current slowing demand for Taiwan's electronic gadgets, the government expects April export orders to fall between 6.3% and 10.3% from a year earlier.
While Taiwan's job market remained stable in March, the government has rolled out measures to cushion the impact on employment, which includes a T$30,000 wage subsidy for workers whose income was affected and interest-free personal mortgage of up to T$100,000.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (TW:2330), the world's largest contract chipmaker, this month trimmed its full-year revenue outlook due to weakening demand.

Taiwan has reported 429 coronavirus infections and six deaths, far lower than most of its neighbours.

February's jobless rate was revised down to 9.3% from a previously reported 9.7%, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported.
Analysts completely misread likely labour market developments in March, with a Reuters survey of 10 economists pointing to a jump in the jobless rate to 10.5%.
Some 27,000 jobs were lost in March compared with the month before, ISTAT said, while the inactivity rate, measuring people neither working nor looking for work, posted a ""strong increase.""
In March 267,000 fewer people were looking for work than in the month before, ISTAT said, accounting for the drop in the unemployment rate, which measures active job-seekers.
March is the first month of jobs data to reflect the impact of Italy's outbreak of coronnavirus which first came to light on Feb 21.
The government's lockdown measures aimed at containing infections have brought the economy to its knees, shuttering all firms except those deemed essential for the national supply chain.
It has pledged more than 75 billion euros in financial support for companies and families, and Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has said repeatedly that ""nobody must lose their job because of the coronavirus.""
In the first quarter as a whole, some 94,000 jobs were lost compared with the previous three months, ISTAT said.
Until the virus outbreak the Italian labour market had held up relatively well, despite an economy which has been broadly stagnant for over a year and contracted by 0.3% in the last quarter of 2019 compared with the previous three months.
However, employment levels had shown signs of weakening around the start of this year.
In March, the youth unemployment rate, measuring job-seekers between 15 and 24 years old, fell to 28.0% from 29.2% to post its lowest level since October last year.
Italy's overall employment rate, one of the lowest in the euro zone, slipped in March to 58.8% from 58.9 in February, remaining around its highest level since ISTAT's current series began in 1977.

The Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for factory activity fell to 31.3 in April from 47.5 in March, falling further below the 50.0 mark dividing expansion from contraction.
Output and new orders contracted at their fastest rate since the survey began in September 1997, falling to 18.9 and 19.5 respectively. 
The only time those indicators previously fell below 30 was in December 2008 at the height of the global financial crisis.
A number of firms surveyed stated that clients had cancelled or postponed orders since emergency public health measures were put in place to combat the spread of coronavirus across Europe. 
""Of concern was a sharp uptick in input prices, with the rate of inflation at the fastest since the hike in VAT in early 2019,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO), which compiles the survey.

""A depreciation of the rouble and supplier shortages drove costs higher, with some firms still partly able to pass costs on to clients.""

The survey's sentiment index for general households, which includes views on incomes and jobs, was at 21.6 in April, down from 30.9 in March.
A reading below 50 suggests pessimism.

The sobering result comes amid moves by major nations to ease up on lockdowns, underlining the stiff challenges facing businesses as policymakers brace for the worst global slump since the Great Depression.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 50.8 in April from 52 in March, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, but stayed above the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a PMI reading of 51.
Worryingly, a sub-index of export orders for the world's biggest exporter dived to 33.5 in April from 46.4 in March with some factories even having their orders cancelled after reopening, said Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS.
Export orders in the private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey, also released on Thursday, contracted at the fastest pace since global financial crisis. The survey, which focuses mostly on small and export-oriented businesses, showed activity for Chinese factories unexpectedly shrank this month.
""It is still too early to conclude that the Chinese economy is growing again,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING.
""The Western world has yet to relax some of its city lockdowns. And even after the lockdowns are relaxed, it is uncertain when demand will return to pre-Covid levels due to strict social distancing measures implemented domestically and in foreign economies.""
With the coronavirus largely under control domestically, China's economy has begun to open up again as authorities loosen lockdown restrictions.
But major economies, including the United States and Europe, remain in the grip of the pandemic amid mounting infections and deaths. Analysts warn the rest of the year will be bumpy for businesses and consumers in China, especially due to depressed external demand and mounting job losses.
""The market's optimism of a quick recovery in China is fading,"" Nomura analysts said in a note. ""We expect export growth to slump further to -30.0% in Q2 from -13.3% y-o-y in Q1 and real GDP growth to remain negative at -0.5% y-o-y in Q2.""
China's economy took a heavy blow in the first quarter, shrinking an annual 6.8%, the first contraction since current quarterly records began almost 30 years ago.
""The survey shows that as many as 57.7% of the factories surveyed have reported a lack of orders. Some have said market demand is tepid, product sales are difficult and it will take time for orders to come back again,"" NBS' Zhao said.
That led to a slower expansion in production over April.
Labour conditions improved for the second straight month, but the pace of slowed to 50.2 from 50.9 in March.
SMALL BUSINESSES SUFFER
A private survey by China Beige Book International (CBB) showed on Wednesday that by late April, 91% of Chinese companies re-opened shop, but over two-fifths of them are unable to operate at more than 50% capacity, suggesting many Chinese firms are struggling to resume normal operations.
""The official story tends to highlight the recovery of the most high profile areas of China's economy, such as large SOEs. But our deeper look at the crucial private sector, especially SMEs, shows critical metrics such as output, sales volumes, and hiring sliding even over a weak March,"" said Leland Miller, CEO at China Beige Book.
A factory owner surnamed He told Reuters that her textile company in Shaoxing, Zhejiang, which supplies to a Los Angeles-based women's clothes label called Comune, had her U.S. client cancelled up to 190,000 yuan in orders in April.
""There have been a lot of factories that went under recently. Many factories around me - they serve foreign orders - are closed,"" said He, adding that her factory was able to avoid that fate because they still have domestic business.
""The impact (from the coronavirus outbreak) is huge.""
Not surpringly, the pandemic has taken a toll on jobs. China's urban jobless rate fell to 5.9% in March from February's record high of 6.2%, suggesting the pain in the labour market is yet to be reflected in official numbers.
SERVICES REBOUND
The service sector, which accounts for 60% of China's GDP, also saw an expansion in activity, with the official non-manufacturing PMI rising to 53.2 from 52.3 in March, a separate NBS survey showed.
Analysts say the outlook for the services and manufacturing remains challenging as concerns remain over job security. Nationwide retail sales have plunged every month so far this year.
Indeed, Zhao from NBS noted that activity in accommodation, culture, sports and entertainment and resident services sectors are still contracting.
One positive was a bounce in construction activity, which is a key driver of growth, with the official survey showing the gauge climbing to 59.7 in April from 55.1 in March.

Chinese authorities have rolled out more support to revive the economy. The People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) earlier in April cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves and reduced the interest rate on lenders' excess reserves.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's March factory output fell at the fastest pace in five months, while retail sales also dropped as businesses struggled with the coronavirus pandemic's sharp hit to overseas and domestic demand.
The global economy could this year see the steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s due to a virus-driven collapse of activity, with Japan's economy facing stagnation due to its export dependence and soft domestic consumption.
Official data on Thursday showed factory output slipped 3.7% in March from the previous month, a smaller decline than the 5.2% drop in a Reuters forecast.
The reading marked the sharpest fall in production since October last year, and followed a downwardly revised 0.3% drop in the previous month.
Automakers and machinery manufacturers suffered output declines due to slower demand for parts and equipment from factories overseas, especially in China.
Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to rise 1.4% in April and drop 1.4% in May, the data showed.
Separate data showed retail sales tumbled at their fastest pace since last October's sales tax hike as the outbreak forced department stores to shut their doors and consumers to cut spending.
Retail sales slumped 4.6% in March from a year earlier, pulled down by tumbling demand for general merchandise and clothing as well as plunging department store sales.
Japan was already struggling with weak demand before the outbreak after the government raised the sales tax to fix its heavy public debt burden, which is more than twice the size of the gross domestic product.
The economy shrank an annualised 7.1% in the three months through December due to the hit from the U.S.-China trade war and the sales tax hike.
The soft batch of data comes after the government boosted its spending package to a record $1.1 trillion to expand cash payouts to every citizen to offset the widening economic hit.
That move was followed this week by expanded stimulus from the Bank of Japan, which rolled out fresh steps to ease corporate funding strains and pledged to buy unlimited amounts of bonds to keep borrowing costs low.
Official data on Tuesday showed the widening hit to the jobs market from the outbreak. The March jobless rate rose to its highest in a year, while job availability slipped to a more than three-year low.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would fall 10.0% last month. Pending home sales fell in all four regions.
Pending home contracts generally are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.

""As consumers become more accustomed to social distancing protocols, and with the economy slowly and safely reopening, listings and buying activity will resume, especially given the record low mortgage rates,"" he said.
U.S. home resales slid by 8.5% in March, the most in nearly 4-1/2 years, as extraordinary measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus brought buyer traffic to a virtual standstill.
Compared to one year ago, pending sales were down 16.3% in March.

The numbers, which are likely to be revised substantially in subsequent estimates, were worse than the 4.0% expectations of analysts polled by Investing.com.
The decline was principally the result of a collapse in personal consumption, as companies started the process of laying off workers in response to mandated lockdowns across the country.

Total employment, excluding foreign domestic workers, fell 19,900 - its sharpest quarterly contraction since 2003 when the country was battling the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. The fall was due to significant drops in foreign employment across manufacturing, services and construction.
Total retrenchments in the first quarter rose to 3,000 from 2,670 in the previous quarter, but was well below a peak of more than 12,000 in the first quarter of 2009.
Singapore is facing the deepest recession in its 55-year history, and authorities have warned that unemployment is likely to rise and wages drop.
The city-state has among the highest number of infections in Asia and has extended widespread curbs to contain the spread of the virus, which include the closure of most workplaces and schools until June 1.

""Labour market conditions are likely to worsen in the upcoming quarter,"" the manpower ministry said, citing the sharp fall in demand globally and local virus containment measures.

Producer confidence fell from 0.2 in March to minus 28.7 in April, registering the largest monthly drop ever, to the lowest level since records began in 1985, Statistics Netherlands (CBS) said.
The April reading compares to an average of 0.8 over the past 20 years and meant that pessimists outweighed optimists among Dutch manufacturers for the first time since 2014.
Confidence evaporated in all sectors of the Dutch economy, as lockdowns installed throughout Europe crippled productivity and demand.
Factories on average operated at 74% of their capacity, their lowest level in over 30 years.

Industrial output rose by a seasonally adjusted 4.6% in March from a month earlier, far better than a 1.3% fall tipped in a Reuters survey and the biggest expansion since a 7.3% jump in February 2009. It shrank 3.8% in February.
""There has been a temporary increase in factory output due to launch of new cars in March, while demand for electronic components from South Korea rose on production disruptions at Chinese companies,"" a statistics agency official told Reuters.

After figures on Tuesday showed the biggest fall in sales since December 2008, the data from the British Retail Consortium added to signs of the damage to the sector from the closure of non-essential stores to slow the spread of COVID-19.
Non-food prices in April were 3.7% lower than a year before, the sharpest drop since the survey began in 2006, the BRC said.
""With lockdown effectively closing the high street, non-food retailers are reliant on online sales and prices have fallen as they look to sell stock,"" said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at market research firm Nielsen, which sponsors the survey.
Clothing, footwear and furniture saw the biggest discounts, the BRC added.
By contrast, food price inflation rose to its highest since June 2019 at 1.8% in April, up from 1.1% the month before, as supermarkets scrapped sales promotions to reduce supply shortages.
Shop prices overall fell by 1.7%, the largest decline since January 2017.
BoE officials have said they expect inflation to fall as the crisis hits demand. 

Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent said last week he expected inflation to sink below 1% in the coming months, less than half the BoE's 2% target, pushed down by tumbling global oil prices as well as the coronavirus impact on consumption.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence tumbled to near a six-year low in April as tough measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus sharply disrupted economic activity and threw millions of Americans out of work.
Other data on Tuesday showed the global pandemic was severely limiting the flow of goods between countries, with exports from the United States collapsing and imports from other nations continuing to decline. The reports strengthened economists' views that the economy was in a deep recession.
The government is scheduled on Wednesday to publish its snapshot of first-quarter gross domestic product. According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP likely contracted at a 4.0% annualized rate in the January-March quarter, which would be the steepest pace of decline since the Great Recession and end a record 11 straight years of growth. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
""The deeper the hole the economy digs, the harder it is going to be for consumers and businesses to climb back out,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist MUFG in New York. ""World trade volumes are going to come off further this year which reminds us of the Great Depression.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 86.9 this month, the lowest since June 2014, from 118.8 in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would fall to 87.9 in April.
The Conference Board survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, tumbled a record 90 points to a reading of 76.4 this month. But the expectations index, which is based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, increased to 93.8 from a reading of 86.8. 
The Conference Board attributed the improvement in expectations to ""the possibility that stay-at home restrictions will loosen soon, along with a re-opening of the economy.""
States and local governments have issued ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders affecting more than 90% of Americans to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, and almost shutting down the country. Some have started to reopen their economies, while others have started easing some restrictions on movement.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher, lifted by a string of upbeat quarterly reports and hopes of a pickup in activity as regional economies slowly reopen. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies, while longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher.
SHARP DETERIORATION
Despite the improvement in expectations, households remained worried about their finances, which could keep consumer spending subdued. About 26.5 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since March 21. 
The Conference Board's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, tumbled to -13.6 in April, the lowest reading since July 2014, from 29.5 in March. 
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. 
The sharp decline in April, together with a wave of layoffs, buttresses economists' expectations that the unemployment rate will shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982. The jobless rate shot up 0.9 percentage point, the largest monthly change since January 1975, to 4.4% in March.
The percentage of consumers expecting an increase in income declined to 16.7% this month from 20.0% in March and the proportion anticipating a drop rose to 18.5% from 10.1%.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 7.2% to $64.2 billion last month. While a shrinking import bill is a positive in the calculation of GDP, declining imports mean less inventory accumulation, which could offset trade's contribution to GDP.
Economists believe the economy entered recession in March. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
In March, goods imports dropped 2.4% to $191.9 billion after decreasing 2.5% in February. Goods imports tumbled 9.6% in March from a year ago. There were sharp decreases in imports of consumer goods and motor vehicles and parts. Imports of food, industrial supplies and capital goods rose last month. 
Exports of goods plunged 6.7% to $127.6 billion in March. There was a broad decline in exports last month, with shipments of industrial supplies dropping 7.5% and motor vehicles and parts plummeting 17.8%.
""Further deterioration is likely,"" said James Watson, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""With global and domestic demand contracting amid the sharpest downturn post WWII, trade will be among the sectors hit hardest."" 
The decline in motor vehicle exports boosted retail inventories, which jumped 0.9% in March after dropping 0.4% in February. Motor vehicle and parts inventories surged 5.1% after falling 0.9% in the prior month. 
Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of GDP, plunged 1.3% last month after slipping 0.2% in February. Wholesale stocks dropped 1.0% in March after falling 0.6% in the prior month.
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index increased 3.5% from a year ago in February after rising 3.1% in January.

House price inflation could ease as record high unemployment slows demand for homes. Homebuilding dropped by the most in 36 years in March, the government reported this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Millions of Americans who have been thrown out of work during the coronavirus pandemic have been unable to register for unemployment benefits since the U.S. economy entered a free fall, according to a poll released on Tuesday.
The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute found in an online poll that for every 10 people who have successfully filed unemployment claims, three or four people have been unable to register and another two people have not tried to apply at a time of acute economic crisis.
Official U.S. statistics show that 26.5 million people have applied for unemployment benefits since mid-March, wiping out all of the jobs gained during the longest employment boom in U.S. history.
EPI's survey indicates that an additional 8.9 million to 13.9 million people have been shut out of the system, said Ben Zipperer, the study's lead author.
""This study validates the anecdotes and news reports we're seeing about people having trouble filing for benefits they need and deserve,"" Zipperer said.
Idled workers say they have encountered downed websites and clogged phone lines, as the state governments that administer the program have been overwhelmed by applicants.
""It's a shame how you work for so many years and then when you need it, you can't get it,"" said Jim Hewes, 48, who said he was unable to file a claim online for more than two weeks after he was furloughed from his job at an Orlando, Florida, second-hand store in March. 
Hewes said he mailed off a paper application on April 9 but had not heard back from the state. 
""It's almost set up to fail. It was made complicated so people would get discouraged and give up,"" he said.
EPI surveyed 24,607 U.S. adult internet users using Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Surveys between April 13 and April 24. The poll has a confidence interval, an indicator of accuracy, of plus or minus 1%.
Some 9.4% of poll respondents said they had successfully applied for unemployment benefits, while 3.4% said they tried but could not get through. 
A further 1.9% said they did not apply because the process was too difficult.
STILL NO PAYMENTS FOR MANY
States like New Jersey and Georgia have struggled to find staffers who know how to update computer systems that run on decades-old technology. Others that have moved to newer technology have also encountered technical woes.
States have also had to incorporate enhanced federal benefits that provide an extra $600 per week and extend coverage to Uber (NYSE:UBER) drivers and other independent contractors.
On top of that, many states entered the crisis with fewer workers to handle unemployment claims as an improving economy had allowed them to cut staff. 
States had the equivalent of 26,360 full-time workers in their unemployment offices in the 2018 fiscal year, according to the U.S. Labor Department, down 30% from staffing levels during the peak of the Great Recession in 2009 and 2010.
Many Americans who managed to file claims have yet to receive payments weeks after they lost their jobs. 
Labor Department statistics show that 71% who apply are getting payments, although that figure varies significantly by state.
Florida, for example, said on Saturday it had sent payments to roughly one in five of those who had successfully submitted claims.
Among those waiting are Rachel Alvarez, 44, who says she now hides snacks in her bedroom so her three children cannot eat them too quickly. The former restaurant server in Naples, Florida, says she has run through her savings since she was laid off on March 25. 

""I have nothing,"" she said. ""As much as I don't want my kids to see me stress out, each one has seen me cry.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers suffered their biggest fall in sales since the 2008 financial crisis in the first half of April as the coronavirus kept shoppers at home and forced store closures, the Confederation of British Industry said on Tuesday.
Together with official figures for March and an earlier survey from the British Retail Consortium, Tuesday's numbers showed the sector was on track for a historic decline, as an earlier boost from the stockpiling of food fades.
""The lockdown is hitting retailers hard. Two fifths have shut up shop completely for now,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said. 
Britain's total economic output could fall by more than a third in the second quarter of this year due to measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 that have closed most non-essential stores, the government's budget forecasters have said.
The CBI distributive trades survey's retail sales balance dropped to -55 in April from -3 in March, matching the series' record low set in December 2008. The expected reading for May is a record low -54.
Two thirds of all retailers said the coronavirus had hurt sales, and 44% said they had laid off staff temporarily, while 8% had made permanent job cuts.
""Near-term fundamentals for consumer spending have clearly taken a substantial downturn as a result of coronavirus,"" said Howard Archer of EY ITEM Club, which predicts a 15% fall in consumer spending during the second quarter.
While supermarkets benefited from consumer stockpiling in March, the CBI said this went into reverse in early April.
""Households may have been dipping into stockpiles built up prior to the lockdown or tightening their belts more generally as incomes take a hit,"" Newton-Smith said.
Figures from retail data company Kantar published on Tuesday showed a 5.5% rise in grocery spending in the four weeks to April 19, which included the run-up to the lockdown.
But official data for March last week showed the sharpest annual fall in overall retail sales volumes on record, with sales volumes down by 5.8% year-on-year, despite largely covering the period before the lockdown started on March 23. 
Many firms in the sector have reported a financial hit.
Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) scrapped next year's dividend on Tuesday and said its city centre food stores and clothing and homeware sections were badly hit by the lockdown.
 Travis Perkins  (L:TPK), Britain's largest distributor of building materials, said its total revenue in the first three weeks of April was down by two thirds from the same period last year.
The British Retail Consortium said on April 16 that spending at its members dropped by more than a quarter in the first two weeks of the lockdown.

The CBI survey was conducted between March 27 and April 15, and is based on responses from 70 retail chains.

Europe's largest economy shrank by 1.9% in the first three months of 2020, Ifo said, adding that it was expecting a 12.2% contraction in the second quarter based on companies' capacity utilisation data.
""We won't be back to the pre-Corona situation until the end of 2021,"" Timo Wollmershaeuser, head of economic forecasting at Ifo, said in a statement. That would mean an economic expansion of 8.5% in 2021, he added.
Ifo said last week its survey of German business morale crashed in April in its most dramatic fall on record, hitting the lowest reading since reunification as the coronavirus pandemic sends Europe's largest economy into a deep recession.
As Europe's export powerhouse, the disruption to global trade from the pandemic has clobbered German factories, while domestic lockdown measures to contain the virus have squashed consumer spending.
Highlighting the business impact of the virus, German car and truck maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) last Thursday reported a plunge of nearly 70% in first-quarter operating profit and said the cash flow it uses to pay dividends would fall this year.
The government has responded with measures including a 750 billion euro ($812.25 billion) stimulus package, but how the economy progresses will depend on how quickly Germany eases lockdown measures.
Retailers with floor space of up to 800 square metres are now allowed to open, along with car and bicycle dealers, and bookstores, though they must practise strict social distancing and hygiene rules.

However, Chancellor Angela Merkel is worried that Germans are relaxing their social distancing efforts and is resisting pressure from some states to press ahead with a further easing of restrictions.

Its monthly consumer confidence index fell to its lowest level since January 2019, dropping to 95 from 103 in March - the steepest monthly decline since INSEE started its survey in 1972. 
Householders' outlook about the future economic situation was the gloomiest on record and concerns about unemployment were the highest since July 2015, INSEE said.
The labour market is fast shrinking despite state-subsidised furloughs designed to avoid mass permanent layoffs, with more than one of every two private sector workers covered by the programme.
The Labour Ministry said on Monday that the number of people registered as seeking work rose by the most in records going back to 1996 as people stopped getting jobs and short-term employment contracts were not renewed amid the lockdown.
France has been under stay-at-home orders since mid-March.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe is to detail plans on Tuesday to unwind the lockdown from May 11.
Householders are also bracing for a sharp jump in inflation eroding their purchasing power, with expectations for price increases the highest since early 1991, INSEE said.

That may jar nerves at the Bank of France, which is predicting that the current downturn will keep inflation weak for the foreseeable future.

The composite consumer sentiment index plunged to 70.8 in April, lower than 78.4 the previous month, the Bank of Korea data showed, and the lowest since 67.7 in December 2008.
A reading below 100 means consumer sentiment is weaker than a long-term average that now covers 2003 to 2019, the central bank added.
Sentiment worsened in all six sub-categories, but the index on current economic conditions tumbled to 31 from 38 in March, the lowest since December 2008. The future household spending outlook index also fell to 87, from 93 in the previous month and to its lowest since July 2008.

The share of mortgage loans in forbearance rose to 6.99% from 5.95% from April 13-19, the industry lobbying group said. The number of new requests for relief fell relative to the prior week but were still 100 times greater than in early March, MBA said.
Ginnie Mae loans grew the most from the prior week, up 1.47%, and they also had the highest percentage of loans in forbearance by investor type, at 9.73% of loans. For FHA and VA borrowers, the share of loans in forbearance stood at roughly 10 percent.
An unprecedented 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since mid-March, erasing all the job gains made since the last recession.
More than 95% of Americans have been under ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders to curb the spread of the virus, although several states have now begun to slowly reopen their economies against the advice of health officials.
MBA has called on the U.S. government to provide relief to the mortgage service industry. Federal Reserve officials have said they are monitoring the situation and may step in if the situation were to appreciably worsen.
""We expect forbearance requests will pick up again as we approach May payment due dates,"" said Mike Fratantoni, MBA's senior vice president and chief economist.
The United States has the world's highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) business conditions survey also found that a third of firms expected to resume normal business operations within five to eight weeks. State and local governments have shut or limited operations of nonessential businesses, to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, grounding the country and throwing millions out of work.
The federal government is making loans available to mostly small businesses, through a nearly $3 trillion rescue package.
The survey of 107 NABE members ranging from single-person companies to large corporations with more than 1,000 employees was conducted from April 13 through April 16.
""Respondents report that last quarter was the worst since the global financial crisis for sales, profit margins, prices, and capital spending,"" said Megan Greene, chair of NABE business conditions survey and senior fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School. ""A third of respondents say their firms' operations have been severely impacted, including a few firms that have had a full suspension of operations.""
Still, three-quarters of respondents expected their firms could survive for over six months without federal assistance. Some 46% of all respondents said they would not seek government assistance through the stimulus package, while 31% in the service sector said they would.
Companies in the goods producing and services industries led the 31% of all respondents who said they had furloughed workers. Just under two-thirds reported freezing hiring, spread across all sectors.
Respondents from the goods-producing sector were more optimistic about reopening businesses, with half suggesting that normal operations will resume in six weeks or less, compared to less than one-third of respondents from other sectors. Sixteen percent of respondents indicated normal operations would require longer than six months. 

The coronavirus disruptions are expected to have resulted in the sharpest decline in gross domestic product in the first quarter since the Great Recession, according to a Reuters survey of economists, effectively ending the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The Commerce Department will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday.

The world's No.2 economy is limping back after weeks of near paralysis caused by the health crisis and tough containment measures, but recovery has been patchy with worries about a second wave of infections and a global recession adding to the challenges for policymakers.
China's industrial firms earned 370.66 billion yuan ($52.43 billion) in March, down 34.9% from a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. This follows a 38.3% slump in January-February, the steepest drop since at least 2010.
For the quarter ended March, industrial firms' profits fell 36.7% on an annual basis to 781.45 billion yuan.
Electronics and drinks manufacturers saw some recoveries in profits from the first two months, the data showed. Eight out of 41 sectors surveyed marked profit increases in March, better than only four in January-February.
The advanced manufacturing sector, as well as private, small-scale and foreign invested companies all saw narrower drops in profits in March compared with the first two months.
But we still cannot be optimistic about the profits situation, said Zhang Weihua, an official at the bureau. 
Market demand has not recovered completely, and production costs remain relatively high, Zhang said in a statement published alongside the data.
The deep drop in industrial firms' profits comes as China's economy shrank for the first time since at least 1992 in the first three months. Factory gate prices, a key barometer for industrial demand, posted the deepest deflation in five months in March.
""China has faced a continued fall in demand for goods from foreign economies due to COVID-19's impact on those economies' job markets and wages growth,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist, Greater China for ING.
""Industrial profits will have to rely more on domestic demand. But conditions are not much better in China.""
RELIEF MEASURES
Beijing has stepped up tax and credit relief for virus-hit firms since February, including cuts in borrowing costs.
However, top policy advisers are still calling for stronger fiscal stimulus as soon as possible.
Beijing's policies are less aggressive than the quantitative easing of other major central banks and it balances the need for stimulus against high household and corporate debt
Chinese President Xi Jinping has said Beijing will step up investment in traditional industries such as transportation and energy as well as new infrastructure areas including 5G and artificial intelligence to boost the economy.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 45.5% on an annual basis for January-March, versus a 32.9% fall in the first two months, the statistics bureau data showed. 
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 5.4% on year at end-March, versus a 5.3% increase as of end-February. 
Private sector profits fell 29.5% in the first three months, improving from January-February's 36.6% slump.

The industrial profit data covers large firms whose annual revenue exceeds 20 million yuan from their main operations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly rose in March, but the gains are unlikely to be sustainable amid the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has virtually shut down the country and contributed to a collapse in crude oil prices.
Despite the slight pickup in demand reported by the Commerce Department on Friday, shipments of these goods dropped further last month, suggesting that a downturn in business investment persisted into the first quarter and would contribute to what economists expect will be the sharpest economic contraction since the Great Recession.

""If growth isn't happening there's no need to buy the equipment to produce more goods if the demand has simply evaporated."" 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, edged up 0.1% last month. Data for February was revised up to show these so-called core capital goods orders falling 0.8% instead of dropping 0.9% as previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders plunging 6.0% in March. Core capital goods orders increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis in March.
The economic picture is deteriorating rapidly amid nationwide lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus. A record 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March. Retail sales, homebuilding, business activity and consumer confidence have weakened sharply.
Much of the slump in economic activity occurred in the second half of March when states and local governments ordered nonessential businesses to close and enforced ""stay-at-home"" orders that have affected more than 90% of Americans. 
The deepening economic slump has seen a handful of states, including Georgia, prematurely rushing to reopen their economies this weekend against the advice of health experts. Economists also warn that such steps could unnecessarily prolong the economic downturn, especially if this triggers a new wave of infections as predicted by health experts. 
There is also no guarantee that consumers will feel safe to start visiting restaurants and other social venues.
A separate report from the University of Michigan on Friday showed its measure of consumer sentiment dived a record 17.3 points to 71.8 in April, the lowest since December 2011. But sentiment improved slightly from the middle of the month.
""As long as the virus is running wild, a significant segment of the population will either be unwilling to get back into the world or will do so in a limited way,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
""The generation with the most disposable income is the baby-boomer generation and they are also in the high-risk category. If they get back in the game cautiously, as I suspect will be the case, the V-shape recovery theory falls apart.""  
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BROKEN SUPPLY CHAINS
Demand for business equipment was already tanking, one of the casualties of the Trump administration's trade war with China, well before the coronavirus hit U.S. shores. That has pressured manufacturing, which declined at its sharpest pace in 11 years in the first quarter.
Business investment has contracted for three straight quarters, the longest such stretch since 2009. With crude oil prices plunging and COVID-19 hitting cash flow at businesses, spending could remain depressed well after the economy reopens. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, gross domestic product probably shrank at a 4.0% annualized rate in the first quarter. That would be the deepest contraction since 2009 and would end the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the fourth quarter.
The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday. Economists believe the economy entered recession in March. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
""Looking ahead, we expect the coronavirus will deal a severe blow to U.S. business spending via suppressed global and domestic demand, broken supply chains, depressed oil prices, tighter financial conditions and elevated uncertainty,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""This will translate into some of the largest pullbacks in capital spending of all time.""
Last month's gain in core capital goods orders reflected a 1.5% increase in demand for electrical equipment, appliances, and components. There were, however, decreases in orders for machinery, primary metals, fabricated materials and computers and electronic products last month. 
A 41.0% collapse in demand for transportation equipment led to a 14.4% plunge in orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more. Durable goods orders rose 1.1% in February. 
Orders for transportation equipment advanced 4.6% in February. March's tumble in transportation equipment orders came as demand for civilian aircraft slumped 295.7%. 
Though Boeing (N:BA) said aircraft orders rose in March relative to February it also reported big cancellations of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which has been grounded since March 2019 following two fatal crashes.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts plummeted 18.4% in March, erasing February's 1.6% increase.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale crashed in April in its most dramatic fall on record, hitting the lowest reading since reunification as the coronavirus pandemic sends Europe's largest economy into a deep recession.
The Ifo institute said on Friday its business climate index of firms from across the economy slumped to 74.3 in April from a downwardly revised 85.9 in March. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a fall to 80.0.
""Sentiment at German companies is catastrophic,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""The coronavirus crisis is striking the German economy with full fury ... Demand for industrial products has collapsed.""
As Europe's export powerhouse, the disruption to global trade from the pandemic has clobbered German factories, while domestic lockdown measures to contain the virus have squashed consumer spending.
Highlighting the business impact of the virus, German car and truck maker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) reported a plunge of nearly 70% in first-quarter operating profit on Thursday and said the cash flow it uses to pay dividends would fall this year.
An Ifo economist said Germany could see signs of economic recovery from mid-year at the earliest, but added that any recovery from recession was unlikely to be a rapid, V-shaped one.
Separately, the IAB labour market research institute said German unemployment is set to rise by around 520,000 and exceed 3 million this year.
In a research paper, the IAB said it expected Germany's economic output to shrink by 8.4% in 2020, making it the worst recession since World War Two. 
The government has responded with measures including a 750-billion-euro ($806 billion) stimulus package, but how the economy progresses will depend on how quickly Germany eases lockdown measures.
MERKEL CAUTION
A gradual easing of restrictions provides for social distancing rules to remain in place until May 3. Schools will start opening from May 4, with priority for final-year students. Hairdressers can also reopen then.
Retailers with floorspace of up to 800 square metres are now allowed to open, along with car and bicycle dealers, and bookstores, though they must practise strict social distancing and hygiene rules.
However, Chancellor Angela Merkel is worried that Germans are relaxing their social distancing efforts and is resisting pressure from some states to press ahead with a further easing of restrictions.
She urged the country on Thursday to show endurance and discipline to get through a pandemic that is ""still at the beginning"", and called for a bigger European Union budget to support economic recovery in the bloc.
Merkel and state leaders will meet on April 30 to review how to proceed, though on Thursday Merkel said they would also meet on May 6, suggesting a delay in consideration of further relaxation and continued pressure on the economy.
German carmakers restarted production at some factories this week, but strict social distancing rules remain in place.
""Gross domestic product for the second quarter will be lousy,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer. ""Politicians should use every bit of leeway to further reduce the restrictions on companies and their employees.""
The Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases needs to fall to a few hundred a day to enable further easing of lockdown measures.
Germany recorded 2,337 new cases to bring the total number of confirmed infections to 150,383 on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 227 to 5,321.
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank, said that even if a vaccine is developed, the pandemic will have a long-term impact of the structure of Germany's trade-focused economy.

""Supply chains are likely to be questioned. Tendencies towards de-globalization could intensify,"" he said.

Alcohol stores, one of only a few retail sectors allowed to remain open under strict social distancing rules, saw sales surge by almost a third in March -– the biggest monthly increase since records began in 1988. The figure doesn’t include supermarkets, where the vast majority of alcohol is bought.
Some put it down to comfort consumption in a nation where civil liberties have been dramatically curtailed in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus. Daily routines have been disrupted, and working from home, or not at all in many cases, means fewer road journeys are being made, removing the need not to indulge.In a dire month for British retailers, food stores thrived, with sales surging more than 10%.

GfK, a polling firm, said its consumer confidence index held at -34 during the April 1-14 survey period, unchanged from the last survey for March 16-27 but still down very sharply from -9 earlier that month.
""It is impossible to say if this is at the bottom after weeks of adjustment to the reality of lockdown life, or if further falls are to come,"" GfK's client strategy director Joe Staton said.
Bank of England policymaker Gertjan Vlieghe said on Thursday that Britain looked on course for its biggest fall in economic output since a catastrophic period of freezing weather more than three hundred years earlier.
The previous GfK survey showed the biggest fall in more than 45 years which took the index to its lowest level since February 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis.
The survey is only five points away from a record low of -39 seen in July 2008.
A measure of personal financial expectations for the year ahead rose from the previous survey two weeks ago but perceptions of how the economy has performed over the past 12 months fell.
A gauge of households' willingness to make major purchases held steady.
GfK conducted the survey of 2,000 people on behalf of the European Commission.
Companies are just as alarmed about the impact of coronavirus and the government's lockdown of much of the economy to contain it.

On Thursday, a widely watched measure of business activity hit a record low and confidence among manufacturers was the weakest since records began in the 1950s.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales tumble in March,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped by the most in more than 6-1/2 years in March and further declines are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak batters the economy and throws millions of Americans out of work.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales fell 15.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 627,000 units last month. The percentage decline was the largest since July 2013. February's sales pace was revised down to 741,000 units from the previously reported 765,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10% of housing market sales, plunging 15% to a pace of 645,000 units in March.
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis because of a small sample. Sales declined 9.5% from a year ago in March.
States and local governments have issued ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders affecting more than 90% of Americans to control the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus, and abruptly halting economic activity. A record 26.5 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since March 21. 
The housing market was back on the recovery path, thanks to low mortgage rates, before the lockdown measures. It had hit a soft patch starting in the first quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019. 
While extraordinary steps by the Federal Reserve to cushion the economy's free fall, including aggressively cutting interest rates to near zero, will keep mortgage rates low, that is unlikely to boost the housing market because of historic unemployment and faltering consumer confidence.
A report on Tuesday showed sales of previously owned homes falling by the most in nearly 4-1/2 years in March. Homebuilding collapsed in March at a speed not seen in 36 years.
Last month, new home sales dropped 8.1% in the Midwest and tumbled 38.5% in the West. They plunged 41.5% in the Northeast and slipped 0.8% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions.
The median new house price increased 3.5% to $321,400 in March from a year ago. Economists expect slower house price growth or even a decline in home values this year as the coronavirus undercuts demand. 
New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. New homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for 10% of sales.

There were 333,000 new homes on the market in March, up from 324,000 in February. At March's sales pace it would take 6.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.2 months in February.

881,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Millions of Americans join unemployed ranks as coronavirus ravages economy,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A stunning 26.5 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the last five weeks, confirming that all the jobs gained during the longest employment boom in U.S. history have been wiped out as the novel coronavirus savages the economy.
The labor market slaughter added to collapsing oil prices, retail sales, manufacturing production, homebuilding and home sales in reinforcing economists' contention that the economy entered recession in March. 
As the economic slump deepens protests have risen against nationwide lockdowns to control the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus. President Donald Trump, who is seeking a second term in the White House in November's general election, has been anxious to restart the paralyzed economy. 
Trump on Wednesday applauded steps taken by a handful of Republican-led states to begin reopening their economies, despite warnings from health experts of a potential new surge in infections.
""Today's report shows the labor market is almost certainly pushing into new territory, jolting the unemployment rate up above the Great Recession's 10% peak and wiping out more jobs than we've gained in the recovery,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, a website recruitment firm.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 810,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.427 million for the week ended April 18, the government said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 8,000 fewer applications received than previously reported, reducing the count for that period to 5.237 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims falling to 4.2 million in the latest week.
All told, 26.453 million people have filed claims for jobless benefits since March 21, representing 16.2% of the labor force. The economy created 22 million jobs during the employment boom which started in September 2010 and abruptly ended in February this year.
The Labor Department said ""the COVID-19 virus continues to impact the number of initial claims."" 
Last week's claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. Economists are forecasting as many as 25 million jobs were lost in April after the economy purged 701,000 positions in March, which was the largest decline in 11 years.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
WORST OVER?
Though weekly jobless filings remain very high, last week's data marked the third straight weekly decline, raising hopes that the worst may be over. Weekly claims appeared to have peaked at a record 6.867 million in the week ended March 28.
U.S. stocks opened higher as investors focused on the decline in claims. The dollar was slightly higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading lower.
""While layoffs and furloughs are likely to continue across a number of industries in coming weeks, we are cautiously optimistic that the peak in layoffs following initial widespread closures has occurred,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
Some of the decline in claims has been attributed to a historic $2.3 trillion fiscal package, which made provisions for small businesses to access loans that could be partially forgiven if they were used for employee salaries. 
The U.S. Senate on Tuesday approved $484 billion in a fresh relief package, which mainly expands funding for loans to small businesses.
With claims expected to gradually decline in the coming weeks as more small enterprises access funding, attention will shift to the number of people on unemployment benefits rolls. 
The so-called continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag and is considered a better gauge of unemployment. Continuing claims jumped 4.064 million to a record 15.976 million in the week ending April 11.
Next week's continuing claims data will offer some clues on the magnitude of the anticipated surge in the unemployment rate in April. Continuing claims have not increased at the same pace as initial jobless applications. 
Economists believe some people thrown out of work because of state-mandated ""stay-at-home"" orders found employment at supermarkets, warehouses and delivery services companies. They expect the unemployment rate will shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982. 

The jobless rate shot up 0.9 percentage point, the largest single-month change since January 1975, to 4.4% in March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity plumbed new record lows in April as the novel coronavirus severely disrupted manufacturing and services industry production, pushing the economy into uncharted waters. 
Data firm IHS Markit said on Thursday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, plunged to a reading of 27.4 this month. That was lowest since the series began in late-2009 and followed a final reading of 40.9 in March. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in private sector output.
States and local governments have issued ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders affecting more than 90% of Americans to control the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus, and abruptly halting economic activity. Since March 21, more than 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits.
""The COVID-19 outbreak dealt a blow to the U.S. economy of a ferocity not previously seen in recent history during April,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""The deterioration in the flash PMI numbers indicates a rate of contraction exceeding that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis.""
Economists say the economy slipped into recession in March. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
The IHS Markit survey's services sector flash Purchasing Managers Index dropped to an all-time low reading of 27.0 this month from 39.8 in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 31.5 in April for the services sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
Factory activity contracted further this month, with the flash manufacturing PMI sinking to 36.9. That was the lowest since March 2009 and following a final reading of 48.5 in March. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11% of the economy, falling to 38.0 in April. 
A measure of new orders received by factories dropped at its steepest pace since early 2009, suggesting manufacturing production could continue to decline through the second quarter. The Federal Reserve reported last week that manufacturing output dropped at its sharpest pace in 11 years in the first quarter.
Manufacturing was already struggling from the fallout of the Trump administration's trade war with China well before the before the coronavirus hit U.S. shores. 
In addition to COVID-19 fracturing global supply chains, a spectacular collapse in U.S. oil prices this week is seen undercutting demand for oil drilling and shaft exploration equipment, pressuring domestic manufacturers. 
According to IHS Markit, ""many firms highlighted the cancellation or postponement of both domestic and foreign orders following the pandemic escalation,"" noting that manufacturers were pessimistic about outlook for output over the coming year.

It said though some manufacturers ""expressed hopes of a turnaround in the third quarter, many firms were concerned about the timespan of any recovery and the longevity of current emergency public health measures.""

Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected initial jobless claims to fall to 4.2 million and continuing claims to rise to 16.48 million.

That's more than the 22 million jobs created in the U.S. since the global financial crisis. Economic activity has halted and there have been waves of layoffs.

Data from the national statistics agency showed consumer prices rose by 2.08% in the year through early April, undershooting a Reuters poll forecast of 2.19%.
That was the lowest level since a rate of 2.00% in December 2015. Nevertheless, the core inflation index, which strips out some volatile food and energy costs, stood at a rate of 3.40%, slightly above the 3.36% forecast by the poll.
Mexican inflation was 3.25% in March.
Mexico's economy is expected to suffer its biggest contraction in years in 2020 due to the impact of the novel coronavirus, and the central bank on Tuesday cut its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points to 6%. 
Still, Mexico's key interest rate is far higher than in the leading western economies, and analysts expect borrowing costs to fall further in the months ahead.
The central bank targets an inflation rate of 3% with a tolerance of one percentage point above or below that.

The latest data showed consumer prices fell 0.72% during the first half of April compared with the previous two-week period. The core price index climbed 0.20% over the period.

IHS Markit’s Purchasing Managers Index for output fell to 12.9 from 36 in March. Services shrank at a faster pace than manufacturing, though all readings were at a record low.
The figures show the downturn is bigger than the financial crisis a decade ago. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said last week it’s reasonable to expect a 35% drop in the second quarter, and not all of the losses will be recovered.
The initial manufacturing reading came it at 32.9 in April, while services were lower still at 12.3. At least three quarters of firms reported a downturn in activity this month.

887,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",Europe’s Virus Lockdown Pushes Economy Into Record Slump,"(Bloomberg) --
Europe’s economy suffered a massive blow in April when government restrictions to contain the coronavirus left companies scrambling to stay afloat.
An estimate of private-sector activity in the euro area plunged to just 13.5 from 29.7 in March, IHS Markit said Thursday. The drop was far sharper than economists had anticipated and marks the lowest reading for the Purchasing Managers’ Index since it began more than two decades ago.
The report is a grim preview for European leaders, who will discuss a possible 2 trillion-euro ($2.2 trillion) rescue plan for the region on Thursday. Governments have already pledged billions of euros in aid, and the European Central Bank on Wednesday stepped up its efforts to shield the most vulnerable countries.
The PMI echoes other surveys that suggest Europe, and the global economy, are heading for a sharp recession because of government clampdowns on movement and business. The IMF says the slump could be the steepest in almost a century and forecasts the euro area could shrink 7.5% this year.
With huge parts of the region’s economy effectively shut down, new business in both manufacturing and services fell at a record pace in April, IHS Markit said. The latter bore the brunt, reflecting the hit to the leisure industry, airlines, restaurants and hotels.
Figures for Germany and France, the euro region’s two biggest economies, also pointed to unprecedented slumps at the start of the second quarter.
The euro-zone survey showed another decline in confidence, as well as record job cuts. Some of the employment decline reflects furloughed workers, though if the situation persists, companies may be forced to actually lay them off.
Some governments have begun to ease restrictions, slowly reopening their economies to help companies and employees brutally squeezed by the shutdown. But countries are aware that they don’t have the all clear on the virus, so it’s far from returning to business-as-usual.
“Hopes are pinned on containment measures being slowly lifted to help ease the paralysis,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economists at IHS Markit. “However, progress looks set to be painfully slow to prevent a second wave of infections. In the face of such a prolonged slump in demand, job losses could intensify from the current record pace and new fears will be raised as to the economic cost of containing the virus.”

The coronavirus has infected more than 2.57 million people globally and killed over 178,000, and with citizens told to stay at home economic activity has plummeted.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, sank to 13.5, by far its lowest reading since the survey began in mid-1998 and considerably below all forecasts in a Reuters poll. 
Even the most pessimistic contributor to the poll had predicted a reading of 18.0.
As countries began to shut down last month the index staged its biggest one-month fall on record in March, hurtling below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction to 29.7.
""April saw unprecedented damage to the euro zone economy amid virus lockdown measures coupled with slumping global demand and shortages of both staff and inputs,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The ferocity of the slump has also surpassed that thought imaginable by most economists.""
Williamson said the PMI was consistent with the economy contracting 7.5% this quarter. A Reuters poll published on Wednesday had a 9.6% contraction pencilled in.
Demand all but dried up this month, headcount was reduced at a record pace and firms cut prices at one of the steepest rates since the survey began. 
Unsurprisingly therefore, optimism was also at a survey low. The future output sub-index, which almost halved last month, was 34.5.
With restaurants, bars and other leisure activities shuttered, holidays cancelled and travel restricted the situation in the bloc's dominant services industry was dire. The flash services PMI sank to a new record low of 11.7 from 26.4.
A new business index dropped to a record low of 11.6 from 24.0, and firms completed outstanding demand at the fastest rate in the survey's history.
April is also proving to be a grim month for the bloc's factories. The preliminary manufacturing PMI dropped to a survey low of 33.6 from March's 44.5.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, more than halved to 18.4 from 38.5.
Demand was barely existent and with many of their factories closed, manufacturers cut staffing levels sharply. The employment sub-index fell to 35.7 from 44.3, its lowest since April 2009, around the start of the euro zone debt crisis.

""In the face of such a prolonged slump in demand, job losses could intensify from the current record pace and new fears will be raised as to the economic cost of containing the virus,"" Williamson said.

889,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",Record dive in German business activity shows 'shocking' coronavirus impact: PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's private sector recession deepened in April as services and manufacturing suffered record falls in output due to the coronavirus outbreak and measures to contain it, a survey showed on Thursday.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, plunged to 17.1 from 35.0 the previous month.
It was the lowest reading on record and compared with a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a much smaller drop to 31.0.
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said the April survey revealed the full effects of the pandemic and subsequent lockdown on Germany's economy, with business activity across manufacturing and services falling at unprecedented rates.
""Compared to a low of 36.3 during the financial crisis, the headline PMI's reading of 17.1 paints a shocking picture of the pandemic's impact on businesses,"" Smith said.
The services sector was hit the most by the lockdown. The PMI sub-index for business activity in services plummeted to a record low of 15.9 after 31.7 the previous month.
Smith said service providers bore the initial brunt of the virus containment measures, but plunging demand and supply constraints had also caught up with manufacturers.
The PMI for manufacturing fell to 34.4 from 45.4 in March.
The survey showed that employment fell much less than output, an effect that Smith based on Germany's Kurzarbeit scheme for reduced working hours that enables companies to keep employees despite a lack of work and incoming orders.
""Still, redundancies and contract cancellations have led to a record drop in workforce numbers as firms look to cut costs and position themselves for a hard slog in the months ahead,"" Smith added.

The increased job uncertainty is expected to curb consumer spending in the coming months, which could complicate the economic recovery once the coronavirus is brought under control.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary purchasing managers' index (PMI) for April dropped to 11.2 from 28.9 in March, hitting the lowest reading on records going back to 1998.
The result, miles below the 50-point threshold denoting growth in activity, not only fell far short of the 26.0 points expected on average in a Reuters poll, but was well down from even the lowest forecast of 18.5.
Activity has ground to a halt at many firms since a nationwide lockdown was imposed in mid-March to contain the coronavirus outbreak, plunging the economy into what the government expects to be France's worst post-war recession.
Companies have since put more than 10 million people on state-subsidised furloughs or one out of two private sector workers, the Labour Ministry said on Wednesday.
With most hotels, restaurants and non-food shops closed, the service sector is bearing the brunt of the shutdown, with the PMI for the sector collapsing to 10.4 from 27.4 in March, well below the 25.0 economists had expected.
The manufacturing sector fared better, but its index fell nonetheless to a record low of 31.5 from 43.2 in March, worse than the 37.5 expected by economists.
The survey offered little hope of respite, with new orders and staff headcount both falling at historic rates in both services and manufacturing.

France's lockdown is for now slated to run until May 11, but the government has warned that not all businesses are going to be able to re-open immediately.

Setting those two sectors aside, the estimate suggests that activity has yet to regain any momentum since the lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak was imposed in mid-March.
In an updated analysis of the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, INSEE said that in the private sector and excluding rents the loss of activity was as much as half of what it would be at normal levels.
With the recovery likely to be gradual after the lockdown is lifted, INSEE said that the impact was likely to be bigger than its previous estimate that each month of lockdown would reduce GDP by three percentage points.
The government has forecast that the euro zone's second-biggest economy will contract 8% this year, suffering its worst recession since the Second World War.
INSEE said activity had picked up in the industrial and construction sectors after health protocols had been put in place allowing some factories and construction sites to resume work.
The lockdown on non-essential activity is due to run until May 11, although the government has warned that not all businesses will be able to re-open straight away.

Separately, INSEE's monthly survey showed that business confidence fell in April to hit the lowest level since records began in 1980, falling to 62 points after 94 in March.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic battered Asian economies in April with social-distancing policies and business closures taking a particularly heavy toll on the region's service sector firms, surveys showed on Thursday.
The outbreak, which has infected more than 2.5 million and killed about 180,000 globally, has also continued to cripple manufacturing, shutting down factories and upending supply chains across the export-heavy region.
Asia's economic woes, seen in flash purchasing managers' indexes on Thursday, are likely to be echoed in other parts of the world with similar surveys from major European economies, such as Britain and Germany, expected to show massive contractions in their factory and services sectors.
Collapsing service sector activity presents a major concern for governments given the millions employed by banks, retailers and hospitality firms, and the threat rising unemployment poses to social stability.
Japan's services sector PMI shrank at a record pace in April, as retailers took a hit from government requests for citizens to stay home and shops to close or operate at shorter hours than usual.
""The current state of emergency will stay in place until 6 May,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Given Japan's lagged response relative to other parts of the world, one would expect this to be extended, meaning the harsh economic effects are likely to drag out further.""
The gloomy data comes ahead of the Bank of Japan's policy meeting next week, at which the central bank is set to sharply cut its growth forecasts and take further steps to ease corporate funding strains.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Services PMI plunged to 22.8, marking the lowest reading since the start of the services sector survey in September 2007. Its factory PMI fell to 43.7, its lowest since April 2009.
The pain was similar in Australia where the IHS Markit Flash Services PMI slumped to a record low 19.6. The Australia Flash Manufacturing PMI fell to 45.6 in April from 49.7 in March.
Separate data on Thursday showed South Korea's trade-reliant economy, Asia's fourth-largest, shrank at its fastest pace since 2008 as self-containment measures kept shops closed and slumping global demand hurt exports.
The International Monetary Fund said last week Asia's economic growth this year will grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years as the health crisis takes an ""unprecedented"" toll on the region's service sector.
Even China, which is starting up again much earlier than other countries, will see its economy recover only slowly from its first quarterly contraction since current records began, according to a Reuters poll.
Japan will continue to suffer the economic cost of voluntary business shutdowns. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced a state of emergency on April 7 for seven prefectures including Tokyo.

He expanded the emergency nationwide on April 16 as the pandemic spread. The government is expected to decide during its Golden Week holiday between April 29 and May 6 whether to extend the emergency - a move many analysts see as a near certainty given the steady increase in the number of infections.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic pushed South Korea's economy into its biggest contraction since 2008 in the first quarter, as self-isolation hit consumption and kept businesses closed and global trade slumped.
Gross domestic product decreased by a seasonally adjusted 1.4% in the first quarter from three months earlier, the central bank said on Thursday, a slightly smaller decline than the 1.5% contraction seen in a Reuters survey and reversing 1.3% growth in the fourth quarter.
Highlighting the challenges in domestic demand, private consumption shrank 6.4% on-quarter to mark the worst reading since a 13.8% contraction in the first quarter of 1998, during the Asia Financial Crisis.
""The economy is likely to contract for at least another quarter as hard times will continue for exports,"" Moon Jung-hui, an economist at KB Bank said.
""Consumption will improve especially on increased fiscal expenditure, but exports of key items including petrochemical products will suffer.""
Since late January, the economy has been paralysed by self-isolation containment across the country, which kept businesses and shops closed and workers stuck at home.
The government on Sunday began relaxing some social distancing rules, but Asia's fourth-largest economy is spiraling toward its first technical recession since 2003, defined as two straight quarters of decline, as the pandemic stymies an export recovery.
Thursday's data showed exports declined 2% from the fourth quarter, while construction investment and capital investment rose 1.3% and 0.2%, respectively.
Exports for the first 20 days of April plunged nearly 27% on-year, and shipments are set to shrink further over the coming months as top trading partners such as Europe and the United States remain in lockdown.
From a year earlier, the economy grew 1.3% in the first quarter, slowing from 2.3% growth in the fourth quarter and compared with 0.6% seen in the poll.
Investors worry a slump in the Chinese economy could severely dent global growth and demand for key South Korean exports items including memory chips and petrochemical products.
The Chinese economy -- which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years -- suffered its first contraction since 1992.

The pressure on South Korea's economy is expected to persist over coming months, with a Reuters poll predicting gross domestic product to shrink 0.1% this year. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) sees an even bigger 1.2% contraction.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Services PMI index plunged to 22.8 on a seasonally adjusted basis, marking the lowest since the start of the services sector survey in September 2007.
Services sector activity compared with a final reading of 33.8 in the previous month.
Large parts of the world's third-largest economy have come to a standstill after the government announced a month-long state of emergency to fight the widening virus pandemic.

""Given Japan's lagged response relative to other parts of the world, one would expect this to be extended, meaning the harsh economic effects are likely to drag out further.""
The economy looks set to contract at an annual rate of more than 10% in the second quarter, Hayes added, likely marking the third straight quarter of contraction.
The PMI manufacturing survey showed the downturn in factory output gained speed from the previous month, with the sub-index hitting its lowest in nine years.
Companies overwhelmingly said that was due to the coronavirus pandemic, IHS Markit said, which triggered factory shutdowns, delayed deliveries and led to a plunge in sales. 
Other indicators in the manufacturing survey such as employment and intakes of new work also dropped.
Japan's government raised the size of its new economic stimulus package this week to a record $1.1 trillion as a demand shock from the virus threatens to push the economy into the deepest recession in at least a decade.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate tumbled to a near five-year low of 0.9% in March as the coronavirus crisis and an oil supply war slashed gasoline prices, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday. 
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a rate of 1.2% in March, down from the 2.2% in February. Excluding gasoline prices, the annual inflation rate was 1.7% in March.
""Canada's CPI saw a sharp contraction in March that was more pronounced than expected but not a shock given the severe impact on the economy of stay-at-home orders and the tumble in oil prices,"" said Ryan Brecht, a senior economist at Actions Economics.
The overall rate was the lowest since the 0.9% registered in May 2015. The Bank of Canada last week said the inflation rate was likely to drop to around 0% in the second quarter on sharply lower gas prices.
""It's quite possible we might see zero or even a negative reading in the months ahead,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at Bank of Montreal after the data release. 
""It will have been very difficult to have collected prices during the month of April. After this month, the data are going to be a little bit suspect,"" Porter added.
Officials have shuttered non-essential businesses and urged people to stay at home since mid-March as part of efforts to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Statistics Canada said on Wednesday the collection of the March data was largely unaffected by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Canadian dollar strengthened to about C$1.4130 per U.S. dollar, or 70.77 U.S. cents, as oil prices rebounded after earlier hitting a 21-year low.
Energy prices in March fell 11.6% on a year-over-year basis, driven by the largest one-month price decline since November 2008, Statscan said. Consumers paid 21.2% less for gasoline than in March 2019.
CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was at 1.7%. CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, was at 2.0%, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, was at 1.8%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Dragged down by clothing and footwear prices, Britain's inflation rate fell as expected in March when oil prices tumbled and the coronavirus crisis escalated, official data showed on Wednesday.
The consumer price index was 1.5% higher compared with March 2019, the Office for National Statistics said, as a Reuters poll of economists had predicted, following a 1.7% rise in February.
A fall in clothing and footwear prices was the biggest drag on consumer prices in March.
""Prices usually rise between February and March, and this year's fall is the first since 2015 and only the second since the start of the constructed (inflation) series in 1988,"" the ONS said.
Sales were likely to have been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, the ONS added.
Although the data for inflation were collected on March 17 -- a few days before the enactment of a full-scale lockdown -- the ONS said consumer behavior might have changed in expectation of the restrictions.
Petrol prices at the pump fell by 5.1 pence per liter between February and March, the biggest drop since December 2018.
It was a similar story for manufacturers.
Petrol prices were the biggest drag on both output and input cost prices for factories, the ONS said.

The country's number of daily flights rose only 1% in April to 6,586, amounting to just 42% of daily flights before the coronavirus struck, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said.

Preliminary sales advanced 8.2% last month, exceeding the previous record of 8.1% ahead of the introduction of a consumption tax in 2000, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in a statement in Sydney Wednesday. The figures will be subject to revision ahead of the final monthly estimate on May 6. The ABS is conducting special surveys to provide more timely data during the pandemic.
There was “unprecedented demand in March in the food retailing industry, with strong sales across supermarkets, liquor retailing and other specialized food,” the ABS said. “Additional analysis indicates monthly turnover doubled for products such as toilet and tissue paper, and rice and pasta.”
Australians swamped supermarkets in March to buy up stocks of food and other essentials on a previously unseen scale, forcing some stores to introduce product limits. This is in contrast with large tracts of the nation’s services industry that are currently shut as authorities try to stem the outbreak.
Central bank chief Philip Lowe warned Tuesday that the first half of this year was likely to produce “the biggest contraction in national output and income that we have witnessed since the 1930s.”
The bureau said gains in food and alcohol “were slightly offset by strong falls in industries including cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services, and clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing, which were impacted by new social distancing regulations introduced in March.”

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales surged by the most on record in March as a lockdown for the coronavirus spurred panic buying of food and other staples, perhaps saving the entire economy from a damaging contraction in the first quarter.
Sales will likely plunge back in April due to strict social distancing rules and the closure of many businesses, but the boost to the first quarter was still timely.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday reported its preliminary estimate of retail sales jumped 8.2% seasonally adjusted in March, from February. 
That beat the previous record rise of 8.1% from 2002 when consumers brought forward purchases ahead of a goods and services tax.
The increase was far larger than any economist had forecast and lifted sales to an all-time high of A$30 billion ($18.86 billion). Sales were up a hefty A$2.28 billion on February, implying an addition to gross domestic product (GDP) of around 0.5 percentage points.
That unexpected windfall could keep growth positive, albeit temporarily. Most analysts had thought GDP would shrink modestly in Q1, ahead of a much more savage decline this quarter as the shutdown caused massive job losses and economic dislocation.
Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe on Tuesday warned economic output could fall 10% in the first half of the year, easily the harshest contraction since the Great Depression.
Yet consumer panic may just have rescued the first quarter. The lockdown, which began in mid-March, sparked a 23.5% jump in sales for the food industry, with supermarkets and grocery stores selling an extra A$2.2 billion in goods.
Monthly turnover doubled for products such as toilet and tissue paper, flour, rice and pasta between February and March. Turnover for canned food, medicinal products and cleaning goods increased by more than 50%.
""These preliminary figures indicate unprecedented demand in March in the Food retailing industry, with strong sales across supermarkets, liquor retailing and other specialized food,"" the ABS said in a statement.
The rise in supermarket sales reached a peak in mid-March before leveling off at the end of the month, the ABS said.
Another gainer was electrical and hardware as consumers rushed to buy the equipment for home offices.
Not so fortunate were cafes and restaurants as most were shut as part of the pandemic fight, while clothing and department stores were badly hit by social distancing rules.

The final ABS estimate of retail sales is due on May 6.

Banco de Mexico reduced the benchmark rate by 50 basis points to 6% at an unscheduled meeting on Tuesday. Officials had already surprised markets with a similar, half-percentage point cut on March 20.
The decision to repeat an unscheduled rate reduction by one of the world’s most conservative central banks reflects the uncertainty surrounding the Mexican economy. Economists forecast the Latin American country will contract 5% this year, with some top banks warning that gross domestic product may fall as much as 9%.
“Considering the risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic for inflation, economic activity and financial markets, major challenges arise for monetary policy and for the economy in general,” the statement read. “The negative effects on domestic economic activity resulting from the pandemic may lead to an important contraction of economic activity.”

Banxico’s governing board also said Tuesday that it’s taking 10 additional measures to foster orderly operations in the financial markets, for a total of 750 billion pesos ($31 billion) -- or 3.3% of gross domestic product.
The announced measures included opening windows to purchase government and corporate debt, “widen” standards for collateral for liquidity facilities as well as provide funding to commercial and government banks to support small businesses.
The country has previously taken steps to increase liquidity in the currency market as the peso has depreciated more than 20% this year, including selling dollar-denominated credit financed by a swap line with the Federal Reserve twice.
Banxico Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon said in an interview after the March surprise rate cut that the board was prepared to act outside its normal calendar of set meetings again if needed.
So far, Mexico’s monetary response has yet to be followed by any meaningful fiscal response from the administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The president has rejected the idea of bailouts for Mexico’s large companies as the effects of the coronavirus continue to hammer the nation’s economic outlook.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 01:01PM ET</span>",U.S. home sales tumble as coronavirus keeps buyers indoors,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales dropped by the most in nearly 4-1/2 years in March as extraordinary measures to control the spread of the novel coronavirus brought buyer traffic to a virtual standstill, with realtors and economists expecting a further deterioration in housing market activity through the second quarter.
The slump in home resales reported by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) on Tuesday added to a pile of dismal March reports in illustrating the economic havoc from the coronavirus outbreak, which has thrown millions out of work. 
""The virus could have prevented some transactions from being completed late in the month,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""Given a range of indicators showing that activity in the housing market fell as the virus spread intensified, we think the existing home sales data likely will deteriorate further in upcoming reports.""
Existing home sales tumbled 8.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.27 million units last month. The percentage decline was the largest since November 2015. The data reflected contracts signed in February or even January, before measures to curb the spread of the virus paralyzed the economy. 
The NAR said it expected a steeper decline in sales in April and in the few months thereafter, derailing the normally busy spring selling season. Sales fell in all four regions last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would tumble 8.1% to a rate of 5.30 million units in March. Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, rose 0.8% on a year-on-year basis in March.
States and local governments have issued ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders affecting more than 90% of Americans to control the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus, and abruptly halting economic activity. At least 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since March 21. 
The housing market was back on the recovery path, thanks to low mortgage rates, before the lockdown measures. It had hit a soft patch starting in the first quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019. 
While extraordinary steps by the Federal Reserve to cushion the economy's free fall, including aggressively cutting interest rates to near zero, will keep mortgage rates low, that is unlikely to boost the housing market because of record unemployment and faltering consumer confidence.
U.S. stocks were trading lower following a historic crash in U.S. crude prices to below zero on Monday and gloomy quarterly forecasts from some companies. The dollar (DXY) rose slightly against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mostly trading higher. 
TIGHT INVENTORY
Retail sales suffered a record drop in March and output at factories declined by the most since 1946. Homebuilding crumbled in March at a speed not seen in 36 years. Despite the plunge in home sales and homebuilding last month, economists expect the housing market contributed to gross domestic product in the first quarter because of robust gains at the start of the year.
But housing accounts for less than 3% of GDP. Economists believe the economy contracted at its sharpest pace since World War Two in the first quarter. The government will publish its snapshot for first-quarter GDP next Wednesday. 
Economists say the economy slipped into recession in March. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
While economists expect home sales to rebound in the second half of the year as the economy reopens, they cautioned the gains would probably not be enough to recoup the coronavirus-related losses. They also said a persistent shortage of homes would constrain sales.
""With unemployment still rising and some social distancing measures likely to remain in place once the economy re-opens, home buyer demand is unlikely to return to pre-Covid-19 levels quickly."" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Credit availability may further constrain the housing market should rising defaults result in more wariness from lenders.""
There were 1.50 million previously owned homes on the market in March, the lowest on record and down 10.2% from a year ago. The median existing house price increased 8.0% from a year ago to $280,600 in March. The NAR said there was no indication the house price inflation would slow given tight inventory. 
But economists expect slow house price growth or even a decline in home values. 
""It's early yet, but it is a recession and in a recession, home prices drop as jobless homeowners who can't pay their mortgages are forced to sell,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
At March's sales pace, it would take 3.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.8 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 29 days, down from 36 days both in February and a year ago. Fifty-two percent of homes sold in March were on the market for less than a month. First-time buyers accounted for 34% of sales last month, up from 32% in February and 33% a year ago.

""Since Monday April 13, there has been a net job creation trend, although very weak, in that sector,"" she told lawmakers, adding that almost 12,000 new workers registered with the social security on April 13-16.

Some 900,000 people lost their job during the last two weeks of March when the country went into lockdown due to the coronavirus epidemic and most hotels, restaurants and shops closed down.

German carmakers have restarted production at some factories this week after the country eased restrictions designed to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Certain shops are now allowed to open, but strict social distancing rules remain in place.
The ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors rose to 28.2 from -49.5 in March. Economists had expected a much smaller improvement to -42.3.
""The financial market experts are beginning to see light at the end of a very long tunnel,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
A separate gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions fell to -91.5 from -43.1 in the previous month. Analysts had forecast a smaller drop to -77.5.
The survey, which was conducted among more than 200 analysts between April 7-20, showed that investors did not expect economic growth to turn positive until the third quarter.
""Economic output is not expected to return to pre-corona levels before 2022,"" Wambach said.
Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen said one should not read too much into the surprisingly strong improvement of economic sentiment as the indicator only showed that, given the current catastrophic situation, many analysts expected a certain improvement or at least no deterioration in the next six months.
""The index says nothing about the speed and extent of the recent slump or the extent of a recovery,"" Solveen added.
Thomas Gitzel from VP Bank said the survey showed a certain form of calculated optimism among investors as things could barely get any worse. ""After the huge drop in the previous month, the motto now is: It can only get better,"" Gitzel said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports plunged nearly 27% in the first 20 days of April as the coronavirus health crisis paralyzed global manufacturing activity and crushed consumer demand.
The worst may be yet to come with many of the country's top trading partners still in lockdowns to contain the virus' spread. Monthly trade data from Asia's fourth-largest economy is considered a bellwether for world trade as it is the first to be released among major exporting nations. 
Shipments fell 26.9% from a year earlier, sharply reversing 9.3% growth in the March 1-20 period, the Korea Customs Service data showed on Tuesday.
Imports sank 18.6%, compared with a 4.0% rise in the previous month.
""Today's data come as the global economy is in a bad shape, while shutdowns in car component factories abroad and a price plunge in petrochemical products have had a negative impact,"" a customs agency official told Reuters.
A breakdown of the trade data showed overseas sales of semiconductors, the nation's top-selling item, tumbled 14.9%, while those of petrochemical products, car components and wireless devices plummeted 53.5%, 49.8% and 30.7%, respectively.
By destination, shipments to the biggest trading partner China fell 17.0%, even as factories there resumed operations, while those to the United States and the European Union slumped 17.5% and 32.6%, respectively.
""The trend in exports slump could continue through June ... It will take a while for the United States and Europe to resume economic activities, while not only the volume of exports but a significant price drop of the goods are a great concern,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
""Uncertainties for an export rebound in the third quarter remain high,"" Park added.
The spread of the coronavirus has been slowing in major economies, prompting debate over whether to ease tough virus containment measures, but the peak of the outbreak still lays ahead as reported cases surpassed 2.41 million globally, according to a Reuters tally.
Businesses have been paralyzed as lockdowns across the globe knocked demand and disrupted manufacturing and global supply chains.
During the global financial crisis of 2008, South Korea still managed 0.8% growth but it contracted 5.1% in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis.
Preliminary first quarter GDP data on Thursday is expected show the economy suffered its sharpest contraction since 2008 in sequential terms, a Reuters survey found on Tuesday. From a year earlier, the economy was seen growing 0.6% in the first quarter, slowing from 2.0% growth seen three months earlier.
A growing number of economists now expect the South Korean economy to contract this year along with the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund seeing a 1.2% drop.

The trade ministry is expected to release the data for full month at 0000 GMT on May 1.

About 5.95% of mortgage loans were in forbearance during the survey week of April 6-12, up from 3.74% a week earlier and from just 0.25% the week of March 2, the industry lobbying group said on Monday. 
That increase helps builds the case for a rescue for the mortgage services industry, suggested Mike Fratantoni, MBA's senior vice president and chief economist.
""To ensure market stability during these challenging times for consumers and the entire industry, servicers need access to interim financing so that they can continue to play this critical role,"" Fratantoni said.
Congress did not include any such relief in its recent $2.3 trillion stimulus package, though some top Democrats have called for it and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan has said he is open-minded about potentially coming to the sector's aid. 
The survey covered 38.3 million loans serviced by independent mortgage companies and banks, representing about 77% of the first mortgage-servicing industry. Extrapolating the figures from the survey to the entire universe of loans suggests nearly 3 million U.S. homeowners are getting some type of forbearance on their loans.

LISBON (Reuters) - Unemployment in Portugal rose almost 9% in March from the previous month, official data showed, as lockdown measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic brought key economic sectors to a halt. 
In the southern Algarve region, usually packed with tourists but now deserted due to the outbreak, the number of people registered as unemployed soared 41% in March compared to the same period last year, according to new data released by the Institute for Employment and Vocational Training on Monday.
Portugal has reported 20,863 coronavirus cases, with 735 deaths - a much smaller toll than in neighbouring Spain where more than 20,000 have now died of COVID-19.
Around 71% worked in the services sector, including in restaurants and retail stores, which have been largely shut since Portugal declared a state of emergency on March 18, since renewed until May 2.
According to the new data, 28,000 people in Portugal registered as unemployed in March, bringing the total of those registered without jobs to around 343,000. Year-on-year, unemployment rose 3% in March, the data showed. 
The rate had been falling for several years as Portugal slowly recovered from a severe debt crisis. In 2008, during the economic recession, around 391,000 people were registered as unemployed. 
The unemployment rate, currently at 6.5%, is expected to more than double to 13.9% this year due to the impact of the novel coronavirus, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Labour Minister Ana Mendes Godinho said on Monday that most companies have taken the government up on a short-term work subsidy scheme which allows them to suspend jobs or reduce working hours instead of firing workers.
""We are trying to ensure that even during a very difficult period in which companies are out of business, jobs are maintained,"" Godinho said.
One million people have been temporarily laid off under the scheme, she said. 
Other government measures to bolster the finances of businesses during the outbreak include credit lines for hard-hit industries like tourism, textiles and agriculture.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Chicago Federal Reserve measure of the national economy plunged to recessionary levels in March as the country responded to the coronavirus pandemic, a broad and swift turnaround from growth that had been well above trend just weeks before.
The drop crossed sectors, and in a single month pushed the Chicago Fed's National Activity Index near the bottom it hit over 19 months during the 2007 to 2009 Great Recession (for a graphic see https://reut.rs/2KjvdvJ).
The Chicago Fed combines 85 measures of economic activity into one index. In March 65 of them made ""negative contributions,"" the bank said in an understated press release headlined ""Index suggests economic growth decreased substantially in March."" 
The overall index fell to -4.19 for the month compared to 0.06 in February in a month where factory output dropped and employment cratered in the face of widespread shut downs to keep people home and stem the spread of the COVID-19 disease.
An index value of 0 means the economy is growing at about its estimated trend rate. 
More notably, the drop in March was enough to pull the 3-month moving average of the index down to -1.47 from -0.2 in February. 
Values below -0.7 are ""associated"" with ""an increasing likelihood of a recession,"" the Chicago Fed said.
There is little disagreement among economists or Fed officials that the U.S.'s recordbreaking, decade long economic expansion ended in March, when an unprecedented public health emergency forced local and eventually national officials to encourage or order ""social distancing.""

The issue now is how long the downturn might last, and how fast households and businesses will feel comfortable returning to normal economic life after the virus is controlled.

The figures in IHS Markit's Household Finance Index were collected from April 2-5, two weeks after Britain went into lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19, and they added to signs that Britain's economy is shrinking fast.
Preliminary official data last week showed that one in four businesses had shut down temporarily since the lockdown started on March 23, and the remainder had put a fifth of their staff on temporary leave, on average.
Britain's government has said it will pay 80% of the wages of staff who are temporarily laid off due to the coronavirus until at least the end of June, and will also help most self-employed people who have been in business for more than a year.
Nonetheless, even those who are eligible will suffer a loss in income unless their employer makes up the difference.
""Around one-in-three UK households reported a decline in income from employment during April, which was by far the largest number since the survey began in 2009,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
The headline Household Finance Index - which also includes households' assessment of their general financial situation and job security - plummeted to 34.9 in April from 42.5 in March. This was the lowest reading since November 2011, and the biggest single-month fall since the survey began in 2009.
Last week the government's budget forecasters said the economy could shrink by an unprecedented 35% in the second quarter of 2020 if it was on lockdown for the next three months.

Data earlier on Monday from Britain's main retail trade body showed the number of people making shopping trips had plummeted by over 80%, while the country's biggest property website said it could no longer provide accurate house price data due to a dearth of new listings.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports slumped the most in nearly four years in March as U.S.-bound shipments, including cars, fell at the fastest rate since 2011, highlighting the damage the coronavirus pandemic has inflicted on global trade.
Monday's bleak data underscored the challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government faces in dealing with a collapse in activity that is expected to send the global economy into its deepest slump since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
After a jump in virus cases, Abe expanded a state of emergency last week to include the entire country, which gave authorities more power to push people to stay home and businesses to close. Japan has reported more than 10,000 infections and over 200 deaths.
Adding to worries the world's third-largest economy is sliding into recession, Ministry of Finance data showed Japanese exports fell 11.7% in the year to March, compared with a 10.1% decrease expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
That followed a 1% fall in February and marked the biggest decline since July 2016, as shipments to Japan's major export destinations from China, the United States to Europe were all battered.
""The impact is likely to continue in April and onwards, which will prevent economic activity from normalizing,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""That will keep trade volume constricted globally.""
Imports fell 5.0% in the year to March, versus the median estimate for a 9.8% decline, after the prior month's 13.9% drop, bringing the trade balance to a surplus of 4.9 billion yen ($45.47 million).
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, fell 8.7% in the year to March, reflecting a slump in items such as car parts, organic compounds and chip-making machinery.
China's economy shrank for the first time on record in the first quarter as the virus hit production and spending hard.
But while China is restarting its economic engines after bringing the outbreak under control, demand has plunged in many other countries after they imposed lockdowns to contain the pandemic. 
U.S.-bound shipments, another key market for Japanese goods such as cars and electronics, fell 16.5% year-on-year in March, the biggest decline since April 2011, weighed by drops in demand for cars, airplane motors and construction and mining machinery.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese exports, declined 9.4%, and exports to the European Union fell 11.1%, due to the globally spreading new virus.
The global economy is expected to shrink 3.0% in 2020 in a collapse of activity that would mark the steepest downturn since the 1930s, the International Monetary Fund said last week.
The pandemic has now infected more than 2.33 million and killed about 160,000 people globally.

The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 20 basis points (bps) to 3.85% from 4.05% previously, while the five-year LPR was cut by 10 bps to 4.65% from 4.75%.
The move was the second cut to the lending benchmark rate this year, and the latest reduction in one of China's key lending rates. Most new and outstanding loans are based on the LPR, while the five-year rate influences the pricing of mortgages.
All 52 participants in a Reuters survey had expected a reduction in the LPR at its monthly fixing. Most had forecast a 20 bps cut in the one-year rate but a more modest 5-10 bps in the five-year as Beijing tries to keep a lid on property prices.
Data on Friday showed the Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter from a year earlier as the virus and tough containment measures shut down factories and shops and put millions out of work. That was the first contraction since at least 1992, when quarterly records were first published.
While the country is restarting its economic engines, analysts say activity could take months to return to pre-crisis levels, with the likelihood of a global recession adding to the pressure.
The LPR is a lending reference rate set monthly by 18 banks. The People's Bank of China revamped the mechanism to price LPR in August 2019, loosely pegging it to the medium-term lending facility rate (MLF)

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of British people leaving their homes to go shopping has slumped by 83% since the government closed non-essential retail outlets last month to slow the spread of COVID-19, the British Retail Consortium trade body said on Monday.
Separately, property website Rightmove said it was unable to provide meaningful house price data due to a collapse in the number of new homes being listed for sale. 
Last week the BRC said retail spending had fallen by more than a quarter in the same period compared with a year ago, and Monday's figures show the decline in the number of people going out has been even sharper.
""Footfall dropped in early March, as many people chose to stay at home and reduce the risk of catching coronavirus,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
""This downwards trajectory was accelerated by the government's decision to put the UK on lockdown.""
Last week Britain's budget forecasters said the economy could shrink by an unprecedented 35% in the second quarter of 2020 if it was on lockdown for the next three months.
Supermarkets and other retailers of food and essential goods are still open, and the BRC said convenience stores had recorded increased traffic since the lockdown started on March 23.
Rightmove - which typically advertises more than 90% of houses for sale on behalf of British estate agents - said there had been an ""abrupt turnaround"" from the best start to a year since 2016 to new sales now being almost impossible.
""You do not have a functioning market when buyers can't buy and sellers can't sell, and so the focus needs to be on what is required to help the market recover once the lockdown can safely be eased,"" the company said.
Visits to Rightmove's website fell by around 40% at the time of the lockdown announcement but had started to recover slowly over the past week, it said.
For the ""daily dwindling number"" of properties put up for sale between March 8, before the lockdown began, and April 11, average asking prices were 2.1% higher than the same period in 2019, it added.

The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators (LEI) tumbled 6.7% last month, the largest decrease in the series' 60-year history. Data for February was revised down to show the index falling 0.2% instead of gaining 0.1% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dropping 7.0% in March.
""The sharp drop in the LEI reflects the sudden halting in business activity as a result of the global pandemic and suggests the U.S. economy will be facing a very deep contraction,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economic research at The Conference Board in Washington.
States and local governments have issued ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders affecting more than 90% of Americans to control the spread of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus, and abruptly halting economic activity. 
The slump in the LEI added to a raft of dismal data published this week. At least 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the last four weeks. Retail sales suffered a record drop in March and output at factories declined by the most since 1946. 
Homebuilding crumbled in March at a speed not seen in 36 years. Economists believe the economy contracted at its steepest pace since World War Two in the first quarter.

The Conference Board's coincident index, a measure of current economic conditions, fell 0.9% in March after increasing 0.3% in February. But the lagging index increased 1.2% last month after gaining 0.3% in February.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 02:51AM ET</span>","Hobbled by coronavirus, China's first-quarter GDP shrinks for first time on record","By Gabriel Crossley and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy shrank in the March quarter for the first time since current records began almost three decades ago, as the coronavirus shut down factories and shopping malls and put millions out of work.
Gross domestic product (GDP) fell 6.8% in January-March year-on-year, official data showed on Friday, a slightly larger decline than the 6.5% forecast by analysts and reversing a 6% expansion in the fourth quarter of 2019.
It was the first contraction in the world's second-largest economy since at least 1992 when official quarterly GDP records started.
Providing a silver lining was a much smaller-than-expected fall in factory production in March, suggesting tax and credit relief for virus-hit firms was helping restart parts of the economy shut down since February.
However, analysts say Beijing faces an uphill battle to revive growth and stop massive job losses as the global spread of the virus devastates demand from major trading partners and as local consumption slumps.
""First-quarter GDP data is still largely within expectations, reflecting the toll from the economic standstill when the whole society was on lockdown,"" said Lu Zhengwei, Shanghai-based chief economist at Industrial Bank.
""Over the next phase, the lack of overall demand is of concern. Domestic demand has not fully recovered as consumption related to social gatherings is still banned while external demand is likely to be hammered as pandemic spreads.""
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP fell 9.8% in the first three months of the year, the National Bureau of Statistics said, just off expectations for a 9.9% contraction, and compared with 1.5% growth in the previous quarter.
Statistics bureau spokesman Mao Shengyong told a press briefing after the data that China's economic performance in the second-quarter is expected to be much better than in the first.
However, weaker domestic consumption, which has been the biggest growth driver, remains a concern, as incomes slow and the rest of the world falls into recession.
Per capita disposable income, after adjusting for inflation, fell 3.9% from a year earlier in the first quarter, the data showed.
""We are hesitant to think that this is just a one quarter event, Q2 will also likely be lower than expectation,"" said Ben Luk, senior multi asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets in Hong Kong.
""To offset weakness in external demand, we will see some policy support later this month or early May.""
Industrial output fell by a less-than-expected 1.1% in March from a year earlier. Highlighting the challenges in consumption, however, was a 15.8% fall in retail sales, which was larger than expected.
PANDEMIC IMPACT
Economists' forecasts for first-quarter GDP ranged widely given the many uncertainties around the pandemic's economic and social impact in China.
The virus has infected more than 2 million globally and killed more than 140,000. China, where the virus first emerged, has reported more than 3,000 deaths although new infections have dropped significantly from their peak.
Of major concern for policymakers is social stability among its 1.4 billion citizens, millions of whom migrate from rural areas to cities to find work each year.
The urban jobless rate fell to 5.9% in March from 6.2% in February, suggesting the pain in the labour market is yet to be reflected in official numbers.
However, analysts warn of nearly 30 million job losses this year due to stuttering work resumptions and plunging global demand, outpacing the more than 20 million layoffs seen during the 2008-09 financial crisis.
RESCUE PACKAGE
China's stability-obsessed leaders have pledged more steps to combat the slump but are mindful of the lessons learned in 2008-09 when massive stimulus saddled the economy with mountains of debt.
Last month, the ruling Communist Party's Politburo said it was considering measures such as more local government special bonds and special treasury bonds.
""We expect Beijing to deliver a large stimulus package soon to combat the worst recession in decades, with most of the financing to be provided by the PBOC (People's Bank of China),"" Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a note.
The PBOC has already loosened monetary policy to help free up credit to the economy, but its easing so far has been less aggressive than during the global financial crisis.
The government will also lean on fiscal stimulus to spur infrastructure investment and consumption, which could push the 2020 budget deficit to a record high.
For 2020, China's economic growth is expected to stumble to 2.5%, its slowest annual pace in nearly half a century, a Reuters poll showed this week.

Housing starts plunged 22.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.216 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was the largest monthly decline in starts since March 1984. Data for February was revised down to show homebuilding decreasing to a pace of 1.564 million units instead of dropping to 1.599 million units as previously reported.
Homebuilding declined in all four regions last month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a pace of 1.300 million units in March. 
Housing starts rose 1.4% on a year-on-year basis in March.
The Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which compiles the housing starts data said though ""many governments and businesses are operating on a limited capacity or have ceased operations completely,"" it ""has monitored response and data quality and determined estimates in this release meet publication standards.""
Permits for future home construction dropped 6.8% to a rate of 1.353 million units in March.
The housing market was back on the recovery path, thanks to low mortgage rates, before states and local governments issued ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders affecting more than 90% of Americans to curb the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, and abruptly stopping economic activity in the country. It had hit a soft patch starting the first quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019.
The report followed in the wake of dismal data on Wednesday showing a record fall in retail sales in March and the biggest drop in factory output since 1946. Economists are predicting the economy, which they believe is already in recession, contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since World War II. 
While the economy's troubles have pushed mortgage rates to near historic lows, economists say this would probably not be enough to support the housing market amid a surge in unemployment. 
A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders dropped a record 42 points in April to 30, the lowest reading since June 2012. It is also the first time that builder confidence was below a reading of 50 since June 2014.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, tumbled 17.5% to a rate of 856,000 units in March. Single-family housing building permits dropped 12.0% to a rate of 884,000 units in March. 

In the volatile multi-family housing segment, starts declined 31.7% to a rate of 360,000 units last month. Permits for multi-family units increased 4.9% to 469,000.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian factory sales rose by a surprise 0.5% in February, following five months of declines, even as rail blockades and the global coronavirus outbreak affected supply chains, Statistics Canada data showed on Thursday.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a decrease of 0.1%. Statscan said the growth was largely due to higher sales in the transportation equipment industry, which jumped 4.0%. Of the 21 industries monitored by the statistical agency, 11 reported sales increases.
Protesters blocked rail lines and roads across Canada for weeks in February to show solidarity with an indigenous group in the Pacific province of British Columbia who were opposed to a pipeline being built across their land. A tentative deal to end the dispute was reached in early March.
On Thursday, Statscan said the rail blockades and disruptions because of COVID-19 in February lowered total manufacturing sales by an estimated C$465 million ($331 million), or 0.8%. 
Statscan said 11.9% of establishments in the manufacturing sector reported their operations were affected by the rail blockades. 

Meanwhile, 9.2% of firms said the coronavirus outbreak had an impact on their business activities, in part, because of delays in raw material shipments from China.

The consensus forecast had been for an increase of 5.105 million.
The number of people already receiving benefits increased to 11.98 million, the report said, up from 7.46 million a week earlier.
The record-breaking jump in unemployment has seen the last decade's worth of jobs growth being completely erased in a month.
The dismal figures came a day after data showing a record drop in U.S. retail sales in March and the biggest decline in factory output since 1946.

China has in recent weeks lifted transport curbs and city lockdowns which had crippled business operations for developers and reduced customer visits to property showrooms, as the authorities gradually brought the pandemic under control.
The coronavirus crisis has killed more than 3,300 people and infected over 82,000 in mainland China. 
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities edged up 0.1% in March from the previous month, having been unchanged in Feburary, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data published on Thursday.
On a year-on-year basis, home prices grew 5.3% in March, the slowest pace since June 2018, easing from a 5.8% uptick in February.
The majority of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes, with the number rising to 38 from 21 in February.
Prices were unchanged in Wuhan，the epicentre of the outbreak, as it did not sell any properties in March due to the pandemic, NBS said in a statement alongside the data. 
China's major property developers, such as  Evergrande  (HK:3333), have been launching discounts and promotions to spur sales. Latest data from researcher CRIC shows sales of the top 100 developers surged 136.2% last month from February. https:// Developers said they expected sales to normalise in April, following an 80%-90% recovery in March, but analysts noted that consumers remain cautious amid lingering fears of the pandemic and potential job losses.

The data showed employment actually rose by 5,900 in March, when analysts had expected a drop of 40,000, while the jobless rate ticked up only slightly to 5.2%.
However, the ABS emphasised the survey covered only the period of March 1-14 before entire sectors of the economy were shut to head off the virus.

""Today's data shows some small early impact from COVID-19 on the Australian labour market in early March, but any impact from the major COVID-19 related actions will be evident in the April data,"" said ABS Chief Economist Bruce Hockman.

930,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","Australia Unexpectedly Adds Jobs, Unemployment Edges Up to 5.2%","(Bloomberg) -- Australian employers unexpectedly added jobs, likely bolstered by hiring at supermarkets and associated supply chains to assist with the spending surge ahead of the lockdown and confounding the expectations of most economists.
The jobless rate edged up to 5.2% from 5.1% in February vs economists median estimate of 5.4%, data from the statistics bureau showed in Sydney Thursday. The participation rate held at 66%.
“Today’s data shows some small early impact from COVID-19 on the Australian labor market in March, but any impact from the major COVID-19 related actions will be evident in the April data,” said Bruce Hockman, chief economist at the bureau.
The result comes as a surprise given companies ranging from Australia’s two major airlines to casino operator Star Entertainment Group Ltd. to department store chain Myer Holdings Ltd. furloughed or stood down tens of thousands of workers as demand collapsed amid forced shut downs.
The government and central bank responded with a massive fiscal-monetary injection worth 16.4% of gross domestic product to support an economy spiraling toward its first recession in almost 30 years.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",Japan business mood slumps to decade low on coronavirus hit: Reuters Tankan,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business confidence plunged to fresh decade lows in April as firms reported widespread damage from the coronavirus pandemic which is threatening to throw the world economy into recession, the Reuters Tankan survey showed on Thursday.
The global spread of the highly contagious virus has caused entire regions to be placed on lockdown, upended supply chains and halted services and production around the world.
The poll showed both manufacturers and service-sector firms in Japan expected to see a further sharp deterioration in business sentiment in the three months ahead. 
The weak business confidence could deal a hard blow to capital spending, one of the few bright spots in the world's third-largest economy, likely raising calls on the government to roll out more supportive measures.
Last week, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency to fight coronavirus infections in major population centres and unveiled a nearly $1 trillion stimulus package to soften the economic blow.
Sources told Reuters the Bank of Japan will discuss further steps to ease corporate funding strains at this month's rate review after it eased monetary policy last month to help firms grappling with the coronavirus crisis.
All manufacturing industry categories were pessimistic about business conditions, according to the Reuters poll of 499 large- and mid-sized non-financial companies, of which 239 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
Among the service sector, no industry categories were optimistic about the business mood except the real estate/construction and information/communications sectors.
A manager at a real estate firm said business conditions didn't see any impact from the coronavirus yet, while adding that some cancellations had started to come in.
""Due to the impact from the virus, orders are decreasing across almost all industries, focused on those for the automobile industry,"" a manager at an electrical parts maker wrote in the survey.
A manager at a transportation equipment maker said: ""Because of the COVID-19 impact, sales are dropping to an extent never seen before.""
Ninety-three percent of companies said they expected the impact of the virus on supply and demand their business has experienced to last at least for a number of months or could not say when the impact would end.
""As there is no precedent, we can't predict what things will be like,"" said a manager at a retailer. 
The sentiment index at manufacturers slumped to minus 30 in April from minus 20 in the previous month, hitting the lowest since October 2009, when the world economy was still on shaky ground from the global financial crisis.
The service-sector gauge dropped to minus 23 from minus 10, the Reuters Tankan poll showed, the worst reading since Feb 2010. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.
Both manufacturers and service-sector firms forecast the mood to be even more downbeat in three months' time. Manufacturers' sentiment was seen dropping to minus 47 in July, while the service-sector mood was seen slumping to minus 44, the survey showed.

The economy is expected to have already slipped into recession - two straight quarters of contraction - in the March quarter due to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic, following a slump in the final quarter of 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies have been battered by the fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak as economic activity ""contracted sharply and abruptly across all regions,"" a report by the Federal Reserve released on Wednesday showed.
The Fed's latest temperature check of businesses around the country was completed mostly over the month of March, during which time the United States went from worrying about risks posed by the novel coronavirus outbreak to most of the country being under some form of stay-at-home order and millions losing their jobs.
""The hardest-hit industries - because of social distancing measures and mandated closures - were leisure and hospitality, and retail aside from essential goods,"" the Fed said in the report in which the virus or COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, were mentioned 93 times.
""All Districts reported highly uncertain outlooks among business contacts, with most expecting conditions to worsen in the next several months,"" the central bank said in its Beige Book report, which surveys firms around the country. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve has taken unprecedented action since early March to try and keep credit flowing to businesses and households by shoring up liquidity in financial markets. Numerous crisis-fighting programs have been launched and it has slashed interest rates to near zero as well as resuming large-scale asset purchases.
Last week it announced a ""Main Street"" program that would make up to $600 billion in loans available to mostly mid-sized companies but it would be another two to three weeks until it is up and running, Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles said on Friday.
The U.S. government also has a $349 billion forgivable loan program for small businesses, but it has been hampered by a slow disbursement of funds since it was launched almost two weeks ago. Data released on Tuesday showed that so far construction, professional services and manufacturing are among those topping the list of recipients. 
NO SECTOR SPARED
Districts across the country reported a severe and broad impact, according to the Fed's report. The San Francisco Fed said there was a freeze on television and film production resulting in widespread layoffs in the entertainment sector, and noted that one Southern (NYSE:SO) California hotel chain furloughed 80% of staff and reduced hours for the rest.
In the Cleveland Fed District, multiple firms in professional and business services said clients had delayed the implementation of new projects and canceled some already underway.
""No sector was spared,"" said the Philadelphia Fed. ""Rapidly rising joblessness has not made hiring easier, as contagion fears and child care needs keep workers at home. Prices tend to be falling, but the wage path is muddled, and firm outlooks are clouded by uncertainty.""
The increasing pain felt by U.S. firms is being closely watched by Fed policymakers and economists as they try to forecast how quick the economic rebound will be once social distancing controls are lifted and businesses can re-open.
Chief among their concerns is if there is a prolonged period during which firms scale back investment and hiring to deal with debt burdens, as well as worries that consumer demand will remain punctured due to fears there will be a resurgence in cases once restrictions are eased.
Economists believe the U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace in decades and the global economy is expected to shrink by 3.0% during 2020, the steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.

U.S. retail sales suffered a record drop in March and output at factories declined by the most since 1946, data released earlier on Wednesday showed. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output dropped by the most in just over 74 years in March as the novel coronavirus pandemic fractured supply chains, suggesting business investment contracted further in the first quarter.
The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday manufacturing production plummeted 6.3% last month, the biggest decrease since February 1946. Data for February was revised down to show output at factories slipping 0.1% instead of edging up 0.1% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output dropping 3.2% in March.
The Fed said ""the estimates in this release incorporated data on stay-at-home orders as well as other information on
industrial activity for late in the month.""
Production at factories dropped at a 7.1% annualized rate in the first quarter, the sharpest since the first quarter of 2009, after decreasing at a 0.5% pace in the October-December period. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy, was already struggling from the fallout of the Trump administration's trade war with China well before the before the coronavirus hit U.S. shores. 
In addition to disrupting global supply chains, the highly contagious virus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has depressed demand for crude oil, undercutting spending by oil producers on drilling and shaft exploration equipment. Business investment has contracted for three straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession. That downturn appears to have deepened in the first quarter. 
Motor vehicles and parts production tumbled 28.0% last month. Business equipment output decreased 8.6%, held down by a 22.8% drop in transit equipment that reflected cutbacks in the output of both motor vehicles and civilian aircraft. 
Production of construction supplies fell 5.8%, while business supplies output declined 6.7%. Oil and gas well drilling fell 1.3% last month. 
The slump in manufacturing output in March, together with a 2.0% decline in mining and a 3.9% slump in utilities production, resulted in industrial production decreasing 5.4% last month. That was the largest decline in industrial output since January 1946 and followed a 0.5% gain in February. Industrial production contracted at a 7.5% rate in the first quarter, the steepest since the second quarter of 2009, after rising at 0.3% pace in the fourth quarter.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, fell 4.7 percentage points to 70.3% in March. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector decreased 4.3 percentage points to 72.7% in March. It is 7.1 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average. Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories fall in February,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories fell in February amid a decline in imports and further decreases are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak severely disrupts global supply chains and the flow of goods.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that business inventories decreased 0.4% in February after falling 0.3% in January. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. February's decline in business stocks was in line with economists' expectations.
Retail inventories decreased 0.3% in February as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.1% dip in January. Motor vehicle inventories dropped 0.8% in February rather than tumbling 0.9% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, were unchanged as reported last month.
Goods imports dropped to near a 2-1/2-year low in February, with merchandise from China the lowest since 2009, the government reported last month. The decline in imports could result in a drawing down of inventory, offsetting any contribution to GDP from a smaller trade deficit.
The pace of inventory accumulation accelerated from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of 2019, before shifting lower from the second through the fourth quarters.
Inventory investment sliced off almost a full percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the October-December period, matching the third quarter's pace.
The economy is believed to have contracted sharply in the first-quarter as tough measures by states and local governments to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, brought the country to a sudden stop from mid-March.
Wholesale inventories dropped 0.7% in February, while stocks at manufacturers fell 0.3%.

Business sales fell 0.5% in February after rising 0.5% in the prior month. At February's sales pace, it would take 1.37 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from January.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's merchandise exports shrank by more than one-third from a year ago, hit by a fall in global demand and shipments due to the new coronavirus, and analysts warned of a grim outlook for exports in 2020 as global economic activity collapses.
Merchandise exports fell 34.6% to $21.41 billion in March from a year earlier, while imports were down 28.7% to $31.16 billion during the same period, a trade ministry statement said on Wednesday.
Oil imports, the biggest item in the import bill, fell 15% to $10.01 billion, helped by fall in global crude oil prices and slowdown in domestic demand.
India meets nearly 80 percent of its fuel demand from imports.
Overall in March, India's trade deficit marginally declined to $9.76 billion from $9.85 billion in the previous month.
Shipments of Indian goods have been hit by the shutdown of factories and cancellation of orders as the infection spread and amid a national lockdown imposed by the government late last month to try to combat the outbreak.
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of the 21-day lockdown until May 3, while promising to allow some economic activities from next week.
The ministry does not issue separate data for trade in services. That is issued in about a month's time by the Reserve Bank of India.
However, the ministry did issue estimates for goods and services trade in the year to March 31, based on the full-year merchandise trade figures and the first 11 months of services trade.
Total exports of goods and services were estimated at $528.45 billion in the financial year, down 1.76% from a year earlier, compared with estimated imports of $598.61 billion, down 6.33%, the statement said.
Economists said a much-feared global recession and a fall in global trade will further hit Indian exports in 2020 while a slowdown in domestic demand will impact imports.

The International Monetary Fund, in a new global outlook, said the world economy is expected to contract by 3% in 2020 as the pandemic causes nations around the world to close down, compared with a contraction of 0.1% in 2009, the worst year of the previous recession.

""Overall for the quarter, this flash estimate of GDP leads to an approximate decline of 2.6% for the first quarter of 2020,"" Statscan said without specifying whether the decline was from the previous quarter or a year earlier.
Statscan said its flash estimate is not of the ""same quality"" of its official GDP estimates and was published to give a timely picture of the impact of the health crisis on the economy. 
Official February GDP figures have not yet been released.
About midway through March, government and health officials across Canada ordered non-essential businesses closed and began to urge people to stay at home in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. 
In its World Economic Outlook released on Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it now expects Canada's GDP to contract 6.2% this year.
The Bank of Canada is due to announce a decision on whether to tweak its 0.25% overnight interest rate at 10 a.m. ET (1400 GMT), and Governor Stephen Poloz will speak a half-hour later. Poloz said last month 0.25% was the ""lower bound"" to rates when it announced its first-ever quantitative easing.

The Canadian dollar was down after the GDP release and ahead of the interest rate announcement.

Investing.com -- U.S. retail sales cratered in March as state-wide lockdowns began to spread across the country in response to the Covid-19 epidemic.
Official data released Wednesday showed sales fell 8.7% from February, nearly three times as much as the sharpest monthly drop during the financial crisis in 2008. That was worse than the 8.0% drop forecast by analysts ahead of the release.
Core sales, which strip out auto sales, fell by 4.5%, marginally better than the 4.8% expected.
""Losses were broad based with the exception of grocers and pharmacies and big box discounters,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Grant Thornton, via Twitter. She noted that online sales fared ""ok but not spectacular.""
As most lockdowns occurred only after popular festivals such as Mardi Gras and St. Patrick's Day, the full impact on bars and restaurants was not reflected in the data.
""For March at least there’s likely to be a very uneven pattern to retail sales and that’s going to be very difficult to interpret,"" UBS Global Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan said in a morning note.
There was, however, clear evidence of the pandemic's especially sharp impact on the state of New York, which has lost some 9,000 to the Covid-19 virus so far.

Sales of industrial goods were down over 43% while food sales fell only 0.9%, the Bank of France said.
The March freefall meant that retail sales fell 7.2% in the first quarter from the previous free months, with small retail outlets seeing a plunge of 9.6% and large general retailers seeing an increase 1.7%. 

More specifically, supermarket sales grew by 7.4% in the quarter and hypermarkets saw an increase of 1.7%, offsetting a 19.3% drop in department store sales, the central bank said.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>","China cuts medium-term borrowing costs to record low, steps up pandemic battle","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's central bank on Wednesday stepped up policy support for its embattled economy, cutting a key rate to a record-low and reducing the amount banks must hold as reserves by around $28 billion as the coronavirus crisis slammed the brakes on growth. 
Combined the moves inject a total of $43 billion into the financial system ahead of a report on Friday that is expected to show GDP fell 6.5% in the first quarter, the first quarterly contraction in the world's second biggest economy in more than 30 years. 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it was lowering the one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans to financial institutions  to 2.95%, the lowest since the liquidity tool was introduced in September 2014, down 20 basis points from 3.15% previously.
The cut should pave the way for a similar reduction to the country's benchmark loan prime rate (LPR), which will be announced on the 20th, to lower financing costs for companies hit by the pandemic.
In a statement, the central bank said that it was injecting 100 billion yuan ($14.19 billion) through the liquidity tool. 
The cut was largely in line with market expectations, as economists believe the central bank would flatten the yield curve by lowering the MLF rate by the same margin as the cut to the 7-day reverse repo rate in late March.
""In general, the one-year MLF is still close to 3%, the highest among all major economies, which offers the PBOC space for further easing if things get worse,"" Yun Xiong, portfolio manager at Green Harmony Capital in Hong Kong.
Some market participants believe the PBOC's dual easing move on Wednesday - lowering the medium-term borrowing cost on the same day when the first phase of a targeted reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut comes into effect - is a sign the authorities are stepping up monetary support as markets brace for grim economic data.
China is due to release its first quarter GDP data and activity indicators on Friday. Besides the first quarter contraction, analysts are forecasting 2020 growth to slow sharply to 2.5%, the weakest in nearly half a century, from 6.1% last year.
""Unlike previous easing cycles, when most of the new credit went to finance spending on infrastructure, property and consumer durable goods, this time we expect most of the new credit to be used on financial relief to help enterprises, banks and households survive the COVID-19 crisis,"" Nomura analysts said in a note.
China's central bank said earlier in the month it was cutting the amount of cash that small banks must hold as reserves to shore up the economy, which has been badly jolted by the coronavirus crisis.
The first phase of the cut came into effect on Wednesday, freeing up around 200 billion yuan ($28.37 billion) of long-term funds, the PBOC said in its statement, although it did not comment on the MLF rate cut.
MORE EASING EXPECTED 
""With external headwinds mounting and domestic demand struggling to fully recover from the COVID-19 outbreak even as most firms have resumed operations, the PBOC appears to be ramping up the pace of monetary easing,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics said in a note. 
""But more will be needed to ensure the economy gets back on track,"" he said, and forecast another 100 basis points of additional rate reductions this year.
A lower MLF rate should incentivise commercial banks to reduce the lending benchmark, as the medium-term lending cost now serves as a guide for the LPR. 
""We expect an LPR cut, but the magnitude does not necessarily match these 20-basis-point cuts,"" said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy in Asia at Westpac in Singapore, predicting a 5-10 basis points cut to the LPR.
Global central banks have rolled out unprecedented stimulus measures in the past few weeks, cutting rates sharply and injecting trillions of dollars to backstop their economies as many countries have been put under tight lockdowns to contain the pandemic.
However some analysts questioned whether monetary easing may be reaching its limits and doubt if it could provide a sufficient boost to demand needed to lift the economy.
""The problem is not the level of rates at the current juncture,"" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Chief Economist Asia Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong. 
""They need to prod (people) to consume,"" she said, advocating the expansion of a consumption voucher program already begun at the local level in the city of Hangzhou.
""They are really under pressure not to cut any further, because insurance companies and banks are really worried about their margins,"" she said.
There is no MLF loans due to expire on the day, though a batch of 200 billion yuan worth of such loans is maturing on Friday. Markets are usually primed for PBOC to take action when the outstanding loans expire.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian consumer sentiment collapsed in April to a 30-year low as social distancing restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic threatened to push the country's economy into its first recession in three decades.
Wednesday's survey showed the Melbourne Institute and Westpac Bank (AX:WBC) index of consumer sentiment plunged 17.7%, its biggest monthly decline since records began 47 years ago. 
The index is now at 75.6, the lowest since 1991 during Australia's last recession.
The survey comes as the coronavirus outbreak has spread in Australia from less than 100 cases last month to around 6,500 now, killing 62.
The details of the survey reflected large shocks to jobs and spending.
Listed companies in Australia and New Zealand have already laid off or began considering laying off at least 121,520 people, temporarily or permanently.
A separate survey of businesses on Tuesday showed conditions and confidence plummeted in March. 
To support the economy, Australia's government has announced a A$320 billion ($205.3 billion) package, including a job-keeper allowance to help businesses keep staff. 
Still analysts are predicting the unemployment rate to shoot above 10%.
Wednesday's survey showed all five sub-indexes fell in April. The biggest declines were in the near-term outlook for the economy and in attitudes towards spending. 
Separately, a Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA) analysis also out on Wednesday showed total credit and debit card expenditure in the week to April 10 dropped 20% from a year ago. Spending on services plummeted 44%. 
Other bleak economic data on Wednesday showed a 90% drop in tourist arrivals from China in February from a year ago. Arrivals from Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany also slumped, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
Despite the gloomy reading, Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans expects that economic growth will resume by the fourth quarter of 2020 after three quarters of contraction. 
""Australia's pandemic experience to date has been much less debilitating than that of the hardest hit areas abroad,"" Evans noted.
""The number of cases is high but has not overwhelmed Australia’s health system, with recent evidence showing a clear slowing in new cases that indicates policy measures are working to contain the spread,"" he added.
Supporting that view, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) noted Australia's fiscal response was ""swift and sizable"".
The IMF predicted a 6.7% economic contraction this year, the deepest recession in Australia's history, followed by a 6.1% expansion in 2021. Unemployment is expected to average 7.6% in 2020 and 8.9% in 2021.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Two-thirds of small UK firms have furloughed staff: BCC,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two-thirds of small British companies have put at least some staff on temporary government-funded leave due to a drop in business caused by the coronavirus, a survey by the British Chambers of Commerce showed on Wednesday. 
Britain's government has promised to pay firms 80% of their salary costs if they put staff on leave rather than fire them - a scheme which the country's budget watchdog estimated could cost 42 billion pounds ($53 billion) over the coming months.
This estimate from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) on Tuesday assumed 30% of staff would be furloughed, and that coronavirus restrictions on business remained fully in place for three months and then were partially lifted.
Even with this help, the OBR said unemployment could still rise by around 2 million in the next few months, taking the rate to 10% of the workforce.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""deeply troubled"" by the prospect, and never promised to stop all job losses.
The BCC survey showed a small drop in the share of companies planning to furlough more than three-quarters of their staff, which fell to 31% from 37% the week before.
Businesses also have ongoing cashflow worries, with 17% reporting less than a month's worth of cash in reserve.
Sunak said on Tuesday firms could begin to apply next week for furlough funds, and that they would receive money by the end of the month. Banks were getting faster at approving government-guaranteed loans, he added. 
The BCC said just 2% of the firms it surveyed between April 8 and April 10 had received these loans, compared with 9% who were still waiting for a reply or had been rejected. 
Some 15% of firms had received other government grants - up from 7% the week before.
The BCC poll focused on businesses with fewer than 250 employees, three quarters in the services sector and a quarter in manufacturing.

944,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",U.S. import prices post biggest decline in over five years; more to come,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices dropped by the most in more than five years in March amid declines in the costs of petroleum products and a range of other goods, pointing to import deflation that could deepen amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday followed data last week showing the biggest decline in the consumer price index in more than five years as state and local governments adopted stiff measures to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, virtually grounding the country and sending the economy into a tailspin and millions out of work. Producer prices also fell in March.
""Import prices remain firmly in deflation,"" said James Watson, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""A strong dollar, low oil prices and a global recession will keep them that way.""
Import prices dropped 2.3% last month, the largest decline since January 2015, after a downwardly revised 0.7% drop in February. Import prices, which exclude tariffs, were previously reported to have decreased 0.5% in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had seen import prices tumbling 3.2% in March. In the 12 months through March, import prices plunged 4.1%. That was the biggest drop since June 2016 and followed a 1.3% decline in February.
Import price data is collected on the first day of the month. The Labor Department said while not directly related to the coronavirus pandemic, response rates for March were approximately 6.5 percentage points lower than March 2019.
Restrictions on social movements to curb the spread of COVID-19 have greatly suppressed demand, leading to slumping gasoline prices and record decreases in the costs of hotel accommodation, apparel and airline ticket prices.
At the same time, the prospects of a deep global recession and an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, which has since been resolved, have sent crude prices tumbling.
BROAD PRICE DECLINE
The dollar has gained about 7.1% against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners this year. These factors are seen offsetting price increases caused by bottlenecks in the supply chain.
""We look for the headline U.S. CPI to drop below 0.5% on a year-ago basis in the second quarter and remain there through the rest of this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's' Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""We also expect a noticeable deceleration in the core CPI this year.""
U.S. stocks were trading higher as the quarterly earnings season kicked off. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while Treasury prices rose.
In March, prices for imported fuels and lubricants dropped 26.8%, the most since November 2008, after diving 9.0% in February. Petroleum prices tumbled 27.4% last month after dropping 8.8% in February. Imported food prices fell 1.0% last month. That followed a 1.3% jump in February.
Excluding fuels and food, import prices edged up 0.1% last month, matching February's gain. The so-called core import prices fell 0.6% in the 12 months through March.
The cost of goods imported from China edged up 0.1% in March after decreasing 0.3% in the prior month. Prices declined 1.2% year-on-year in March.
Last month, prices for imported capital goods edged up 0.1%, matching February's gain.
The cost of imported motor vehicles shot up 0.4% after being unchanged in February. But prices for consumer goods excluding autos dropped 0.3% in March after being unchanged in the prior month, pointing to weak core consumer prices.

The report also showed export prices dropped 1.6% in March, the largest decline since January 2015, depressed by decreases in prices for agricultural and nonagricultural products. That followed a 1.1% drop in February. Export prices fell 3.6% on a year-on-year basis in March, the largest decrease since May 2016. Export prices dropped 1.3% year-on-year in February.

945,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 03:20AM ET</span>","China's trade slump eases in March, but pandemic set to deepen export downturn","BEIJING (Reuters) - The plunge in China's exports and imports eased in March as factories resumed production, but shipments are set to shrink sharply over coming months as the coronavirus crisis shuts down many economies and puts the brakes on a near-term recovery. 
Financial markets breathed a sigh of relief after customs data on Tuesday showed overseas shipments fell 6.6% in March year-on-year, improving from a 17.2% slide in January-February, as exporters rushed to clear a backlog of orders after forced production shutdowns.
Economists had forecast shipments to drop 14% from a year earlier.
Yet, while the trade figures were not bad as feared, analysts say the export and overall growth outlook for the world's second-biggest economy remains grim as the pandemic has brought business activity across the globe to a standstill.
""The above-expectation March trade figures do not mean that the future is carefree,"" said Zhang Yi, Beijing-based chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management.
Zhang said he expects first-quarter gross domestic product data on Friday will likely show a contraction of 8% - the first quarterly slump since at least 1992. Analysts' forecasts for China's first quarter GDP ranged widely between a contraction of 2% and 16%. 
""A decline in exports throughout the second quarter has been the market consensus now and a drop of 20% or more is a high-probability event. For policymakers, more policies should be rolled out to address the possible societal issues stemming from mass-scale unemployment,"" Zhang said.
The data showed imports slid 0.9% from a year earlier, also above market expectations of a 9.5% drop, which the customs attributed to improving domestic demand. They had fallen 4% in the first two months of the year. 
The better imports picture partly reflected shipments that were stuck in ports being cleared and catch-up demand as authorities eased restrictions. Yet, domestic consumption was far from robust with key imports such as iron ore dipping in March, underlining the broad economic strains.
""Imports should hold up better given that domestic demand looks set to stage a further recovery in the coming months,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. 
""But the quarter of China's imports that feed into China's export sector will continue to fall and hold back the recovery in imports."" 
The overall trade surplus last month stood at $19.9 billion, compared with an expected $18.55 billion surplus in the poll and a deficit of $7.096 billion in January-February.
Stock markets in Asia extended their gains after China's trade report, while risk sensitive currencies including the Australian and New Zealand dollars as well as the pound pulled ahead, mainly on relief on the less gloomy data. [MKTS/GLOB]
JOBS, INCOME, EXPORTS PRESSURED 
China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year, has reported 82,249 infections and 3,341 deaths as of April 13. Worldwide, infections have surpassed 1.8 million with over 119,000 deaths. 
The pandemic's sweeping impact on businesses and consumers has triggered an unprecedented burst of stimulus from policymakers in the past two months, with the World Trade Organization forecasting that goods trade would shrink more steeply this year than during the global financial crisis.
Beijing is trying to restart its economic engines after weeks of near paralysis to contain the pandemic that had severely restricted business activity, flow of goods and the daily life of people. 
But as the virus rapidly spread to almost all of China's trading partners, severely restraining overseas demand particularly in European and U.S. markets, Chinese factories' export orders have been scrapped. Many privately-owned exporters have been forced to fire workers and warned about factory closures in not too distant future.
UBS Economist Tao Wang predicted that exports would decline by 20% on-year in the second quarter and 12% for the whole of 2020.
Wenzhou Juna Shoe Industry Co, which used to export 90% of its leather shoes to Russia, South Korea and Australia, had 30% of its orders cancelled last month, with clients delaying the shipments of another 20%, according to a report from China Central Television (CCTV) on Sunday.
Half of its production lines were suspended overnight, said CCTV, citing the company manager Wan Jiayong.
Customs spokesman Li Kuiwen also warned about the difficulties facing foreign trade.
""Shrinking global demand is set to cause a shock to our country's exports, and issues such as declining export orders have gradually emerged. The difficulties facing our foreign trade development cannot be underestimated,"" said Li. 
Indeed, both official and private factory surveys for March showed new export orders declined even further from February when production in the country was paused, with few signs of a strong near-term recovery.
Analysts say consumer appetite would also remain depressed as many people are worried about the possibility of new infections, job security and potential cuts to wages as the economy struggles, analyst warned.
""The sharp decline in exports and trade could put another over 10 million jobs related to exports at risk in the next couple of quarters,"" UBS' Wang said.

949,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 09:54PM ET</span>",Australian Business Confidence Plummets to Lowest on Record,"(Bloomberg) --
Australian business confidence plummeted in March to the lowest level in the history of the survey as industry shutdowns designed to stem the spread of coronavirus sent the economy into a tailspin.
A gauge of sentiment slid to -66 from -2 in February, the biggest decline on record, National Australia Bank Ltd. said Tuesday. The conditions index -- which measures hiring, sales and profits -- slumped to -21 from 0.
“Recreation and personal services recorded the largest hit, unsurprising given the effective shut down of these sectors,” NAB said in a statement. “Forward orders collapsed to their lowest level on record, while capacity utilization also saw a sharp decline. Overall, the decline in forward orders and business conditions imply a large fall in GDP in the next 6 months.”
Australia’s Treasury forecasts unemployment will almost double this quarter to 10% and would’ve gone to 15% if not for fiscal stimulus measures. The government and Reserve Bank have assembled a fiscal-monetary shot worth A$320 billion ($205 billion), or about 16.4% of gross domestic product.
The survey saw a sharp decline in the employment index to -20 in March from 1, which NAB said is consistent with “a notable tick up” in unemployment. Economists forecast 30,000 roles were lost in March and the jobless rate rose to 5.4%, ahead of data Thursday.
“While it is unlikely that the unprecedented policy support targeted at the business sector will be unable to offset the near-term pain, it will be very important in supporting activity in the recovery phase,” said Alan Oster, NAB’s chief economist. “There is significant risk that a blow to confidence of this magnitude for an extended period could lead to ongoing fallout in terms of employment growth and capital expenditure by business.”

National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) index of business conditions dived to -21 in March, from 0 in February, far below the long-run average of +6.
The survey's measure of business confidence plunged to -66, from -2, the lowest in the history of the series and lower even than the recession of the early 1990s.
""Worryingly, but not surprisingly, business's outlook is the weakest ever,"" said NAB Group Chief Economist Alan Oster. ""Business has essentially told us that trading conditions, profitability and employment all went backwards in a big way in the month.
""We expect a recession of unprecedented speed and magnitude for the Australian economy over the next three quarters. This will see a sharp increase in unemployment.""
Measures of sales, profits and employment all dropped sharply, with the jobs index shedding 21 points to stand at -20 in March.
Recreation & personal services saw the largest hit to activity, while forward orders collapsed to their lowest on record and capacity utilisation shrank.
The virus has wreaked havoc on two of the country's most lucrative sectors - tourism and education - with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) warning economic output will suffer a very sharp contraction this quarter.
The central bank has reduced interest rates to an all-time low of 0.25% and launched a major campaign of bond buying to pump liquidity into the financial system.
The Australian government has pledged over A$200 billion in fiscal stimulus, including A$130 billion for an employee subsidy that could help limit job cuts in hard hit sectors.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Tuesday said unemployment was still likely to hit 10% by June, but it might have been as high as 15% without the stimulus.
""While almost everyone expects a fairly rapid bound back in activity once the spread of the coronavirus is contained and social distancing rules are relaxed, the immediate worry for the business sector is the impact on cash flows,"" said NAB's Oster.

""For now more businesses expect it to get worse before it gets better.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak on the Indian economy would depend on the depth, duration and diffusion of the crisis, the Reserve Bank of India said in the minutes of its emergency monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in March. 
The RBI in late March cut its main short-term lending rate by a larger than expected 75 basis points and took several measures to infuse liquidity in to the banking system to counter the economic fallout from the COVID-19 outbreak.
""There is an unprecedented uncertainty about the exact impact COVID-19 will have on the near-term growth outlook. Though difficult to quantify, it is clear that aggregate demand will weaken significantly in the near future, which will impact the growth prospects for the year as a whole,"" wrote RBI executive director and MPC member Janak Raj. 
""The main challenge for monetary policy at this juncture is to ensure that the adverse impact of COVID-19 on domestic demand is not amplified.""
Several analyts have cut their 2020/21 GDP growth forecasts to 1.5-2%, its lowest in decades, while the RBI has officially refrained from providing any GDP projection on account of the rapidly evolving situation.
A Reuters poll of economists showed that Asia's third-largest economy is expected to have expanded at its slowest pace in eight years in the first quarter and would slow further this quarter. [ECILT/IN] 
""The COVID-19 pandemic is an invisible assassin which needs to be contained quickly before it spreads and wreaks havoc on valuable human lives and the macro economy,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das wrote in his minutes.
""In this scenario, it is important to ensure that finance, which is the lifeline of the economy, keeps flowing seamlessly to various sectors."" 
Most members said the outlook on inflation, which is the key mandate of the committee, has changed drastically since they last met in February and provided ample room to cut rates.
Most agreed the fall in global crude oil prices resulting from the pandemic is also likely to help India, which imports about two thirds of its oil requirements.
Data due to be released later in the day is expected to show inflation dropped to a four-month low of 5.93% in March, compared with 6.58% in February.
The MPC is mandated to keep inflation between 2% and 6%, with a medium-term target of 4%. 
""Weaker overall demand outlook and lower crude oil prices should keep upside risks to inflation firmly contained, even in the face of temporary supply chain disruptions and scope for opportunistic use of pricing power,"" Das said.

""Arresting risks to the growth outlook and preserving financial stability should, accordingly, receive the highest priority.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States racked up a $744 billion budget deficit in the first half of fiscal 2020, up 8% from a year earlier, the Treasury said on Friday, ahead of an expected April spending explosion and withering of revenues amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Treasury said the budget deficit for March totaled $119 billion, down 19% on slightly higher revenues and lower outlays altered by calendar shifts, but the data did not show significant effects from virus-prompted business shutdowns. The U.S. fiscal year started in October 2019.
Outlays from a $2.2 trillion rescue package passed on March 27 are only just beginning. Tax payments due on April 15 have been delayed until July 15.
""We will certainly see a significant impact to receipts in the April results,"" a U.S. Treasury official told reporters. ""On outlays there will be a significant impact as well, as some of the stimulus programs will have begun to be paid.""
Oxford Economics said in a research note that the second-half deficit will likely double to $1.5 trillion, bringing the full year gap to a record $2.2 trillion.
""If additional stimulus measures are passed, the deficit will be larger,"" they wrote. 
About $283 billion in non-withheld individual income taxes were paid in April 2019, according to Treasury data. The filing and payment delay will likely reduce such receipts in April 2020, the Treasury official said.
Receipts for taxes withheld from worker paychecks, which totaled $114 billion in April 2019, are expected to be reduced by rising unemployment. 
The $744 billion six-month deficit fell well short of the record https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-budget/update-2-us-budget-gap-soars-in-first-half-of-fiscal-2009-idUSN1047829820090410 $957 billion first-half budget gap in 2009, a period reflecting the worst months of the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the start of a deep recession.
The full-year 2009 deficit also was a record that still stands, at $1.41 trillion, with $1-trillion plus deficits following for the next three years.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Thursday that the coronavirus pandemic had already caused a recession that will be deeper than 2009 - the worst since the 1930s Great Depression - with a partial rebound expected in 2021.
The Congressional Budget Office forecast in January, well before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak became apparent, that fiscal 2020 full year deficit would hit $1.02 trillion after reaching $984 billion in fiscal 2019. 
Receipts for the first six months of 2020 totaled $1.6 trillion, a first-half record that was up 6% from a year earlier, while outlays totaled $2.35 trillion, also a record that was 7% higher than a year ago. 
In March, receipts totaled $237 billion, up 3% from a year earlier, while outlays fell 5% to $356 billion. But significant March benefit payments were pushed into February, reducing outlays by $51 billion.

Accounting for calendar effects, March had an adjusted deficit of $170 billion, compared with an adjusted deficit of $136 billion in March 2019. For the fiscal year, the adjusted deficit was $744 billion compared with $690 billion in the same period the prior year.

955,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices post largest drop in five years amid coronavirus disruptions,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices fell by the most in more than five years in March and further decreases are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak suppresses demand for some goods and services, offsetting price increases related to shortages resulting from disruptions to the supply chain.
With the country virtually at a stand-still, the economy rapidly contracting and millions unemployed as state and local governments adopt stiff measures to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, economists are predicting the disinflationary trend will persist for a while or even a short period of outright deflation.
""The big concern right now is deflation,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""Deflation is likely to take hold over the next few months as businesses slash prices in response to much lower demand from the coronavirus outbreak and associated restrictions on movement.""
The Labor Department said on Friday its consumer price index dropped 0.4% last month amid a tumble in the cost of gasoline, and record decreases in hotel accommodation, apparel and airline ticket prices. That was the biggest drop since January 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in February. In the 12 months through March, the CPI increased 1.5%, the smallest advance since February 2019, after accelerating 2.3% in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI dropping 0.3% in March and climbing 1.6% year-on-year.
Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during an economic downturn as consumers and businesses can delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices. It can also distort monetary policy, the labor market and signals from stock and real estate prices, economists say.

Economists believe the economy entered recession in March.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
The Federal Reserve has adopted extraordinary measures to cushion the economy's free-fall. President Donald Trump last month signed a historic $2.3 trillion package to aid businesses and workers. A record 16.8 million people have applied for unemployment benefits in the last three weeks. The unemployment rate is expected to top 10% in April.
Economists said it was unlikely these massive stimulus measures would spark inflation, noting that price pressures remained low during the Great Recession and after despite the U.S. central bank pumping money into the economy through extensive bond buying programs.
""The disinflationary impulse, along with the great disruption in economic and financial market activity, is a key reason why the Fed is unleashing vast new monetary policy stimulus,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Restaurants, bars and other social venues have been shuttered. Clothing retailers have also closed shop as have some manufacturers, while transportation has been drastically scaled back. Fears of a sharp global recession and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia have led to a collapse in crude prices. This is expected to offset price increases caused by bottlenecks in the supply chain.
The widespread business closures affected March's CPI report, with in-store data collection suspended on March 16, the Labor Department said. It said data collection last month was also impacted ""by the temporary closing or limited operations of certain types of establishments,"" leading to ""an increase in the number of prices being considered temporarily unavailable and imputed.""
That resulted in many indexes being based on smaller amounts of collected prices than usual, and a small number of indexes that are normally published were not published in March. Those issues will likely persist with April's inflation data collection.
The dollar was trading marginally lower against a basket of currencies. Wall Street and the U.S. Treasury market are closed for Good Friday.

BROAD WEAKNESS
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI dipped 0.1% in March, the first drop since January 2010. The so-called core CPI had increased 0.2% for two straight months. Underlying inflation fell in March also as prices for new motor vehicles declined by the most since April 2018.
In the 12 months through March, the core CPI rose 2.1% after increasing 2.4% in February.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target.
The core PCE price index increased 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in February after rising 1.7% in January. It undershot its target in 2019. Based on Thursday's producer price index report and the CPI data, economists expect the core PCE price index was unchanged in March. The report will be released at the end of the month.
In March, gasoline prices plunged 10.5%, the most since February 2016, after dropping 3.4% in February. Food prices rose 0.3% last month after gaining 0.4% in February. Prices for food consumed at home increased 0.5%, matching February's rise.
Economists expect an acceleration in food prices in April because of stockpiling and hoarding by consumers, and would be monitoring the CPI data for shortages in specific areas.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3%. That followed a 0.2% gain in February.
The cost of hotel and motel accommodation tumbled a record 7.7% last month. Airline fares plunged 12.6%, the biggest decline on record. Apparel prices dropped a record 2.0% last month after increasing 0.4% in February.
""The sharp price declines are overwhelmingly in areas where consumption has fallen back sharply,"" said Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.

There were increases in used motor vehicles and trucks, motor vehicle insurance, education, recreation, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and personal care products prices. Healthcare costs increased 0.4%, driven by visits to doctors' offices and hospital services.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 08:50PM ET</span>",Japan's wholesale prices mark first fall in five months as pandemic hits global demand,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's wholesale prices marked the first annual decline in five months in March, suggesting that slumping global demand for oil and raw material due to the coronavirus pandemic will weigh on inflation in coming months.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, fell 0.4% in March from a year earlier, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Friday.
The drop was bigger than a median market forecast for a 0.1% decline and followed a 0.8% rise in February. It was the first year-on-year fall since last October, when prices fell 0.3%.
Prices of oil and coal prices fell 10.3% in March from a year earlier, while those of non-ferrous metal goods were down 7.6%, the data showed.
Wholesale prices, considered a leading indicator for consumer inflation, have been under pressure from slumping oil and metal costs as the pandemic paralyses global economic activity.
The data heightens the chance the BOJ will cut its consumer inflation forecasts when it conducts a quarterly review of its projections at its April 27-28 policy meeting.
Under its current forecasts made in January, the BOJ expects core consumer inflation to hit 1.0% in the fiscal year that began in April, remaining distant from its 2% target.

Sources have told Reuters the BOJ is likely to make a rare projection this month that the world's third-largest economy will shrink this year as the pandemic threatens to push the country deep into recession.

957,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",U.S. February wholesale inventories revised down,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories fell more than initially estimated in February and could shrink further as the novel coronavirus outbreak depresses imports. 
The Commerce Department said on Thursday that wholesale inventories dropped 0.7% in February instead of declining 0.5% as reported last month. Stocks at wholesalers fell 0.6% in January. They declined 1.3% on a year-on-year basis in February.
The decline in inventories was across the board, with steep falls in automobile, furniture, computer equipment, farm products and petroleum.
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product fell 0.5% in February.
Goods imports dropped to near a 2-1/2-year low in February, with merchandise from China the lowest since 2009, the government reported last week. The decline in imports could result in a drawing down of inventory, offsetting any contribution to GDP from a smaller trade deficit.
The pace of inventory accumulation accelerated from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of 2019, before shifting lower from the second through the fourth quarters. 
Inventory investment sliced off almost a full percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the October-December period, matching the third quarter's pace. 
The economy is believed to have contracted sharply in the first-quarter as tough measures by states and local governments to control the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus brought the country to a sudden top from mid-March.

Sales at wholesalers dropped 0.8% in February after increasing 1.3% in January. At February's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.31 months to clear shelves, unchanged from January.

958,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Sentiment Plummeted in April by Most on Record,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer sentiment suffered a record decline in April as coronavirus infections grew, thousands of businesses closed and millions of Americans were laid off.
The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index plummeted 18.1 points to 71, according to data Thursday. The measure stands at its lowest since 2011 and was weaker than the median projection of 75 in a Bloomberg survey of economists.
The gauge of current conditions slid by the most on record to 72.4, while a measure of expectations dropped 9.7 points to 70.
Social-distancing measures and closures of non-essential businesses across most U.S. states have resulted in an unprecedented 16.8 million applications for jobless benefits in the past three weeks. Consumer spending is projected to collapse and the economy is likely in a recession.
“Consumers need to be prepared for a longer and deeper recession rather than the now discredited message that pent-up demand will spark a quick and robust economic recovery,” said Richard Curtin, director of the survey, in a statement. “Sharp additional declines may occur when consumers adjust to a slower expected pace of the economic recovery.”
The survey was conducted March 25 through April 7, a period that includes the record surge in applications for jobless benefits and stock-market volatility. While it also included a massive relief package from government, getting funds to consumers and business has proved difficult because of the enormity of the task.
Surging unemployment was spontaneously mentioned by two-thirds of consumers, just below the nearly three-quarters of respondents in February 2009.
The share of respondents who reported improved finances dropped to 36% this month from an all-time peak of 58% in February, the university said. Consumers expected a decline of 0.6% in their incomes in the year ahead, the biggest drop ever recorded, though the survey indicated respondents felt the impact would be temporary.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices fall in March,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell in March, with the cost of goods dropping by the most since 2015, and further declines are likely as the novel coronavirus weighs on demand for energy products. 
The Labor Department said on Thursday its producer price index for final demand slipped 0.2% last month after dropping 0.6% in February, which was the biggest decline since January 2015. In the 12 months through March, the PPI gained 0.7%. 
That followed a 1.3% increase in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI decreasing 0.4% in March and gaining 0.5% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices fell 0.2%, the largest decrease since October 2015, after dipping 0.1% in February. The so-called core PPI increased 1.0% in the 12 months through March after advancing 1.4% in February.
The coronavirus pandemic is suppressing demand for services like transportation, hotel accommodation, entertainment and recreation. At the same time, the specter of a deep global recession and an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia have sent crude prices tumbling. This is expected to offset price increases caused by bottlenecks in the supply chain.
The Federal Reserve tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index increased 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in February after rising 1.7% in January. It undershot its target in 2019. March data will be released at the end of the month. 
In March, wholesale energy prices tumbled 6.7% after dropping 3.6% in February. They were weighed down by a 16.8% plunge in gasoline prices. That followed a 6.5% decline in February. Gasoline accounted for 80% of the drop in the cost of goods last month.
Goods prices dropped 1.0%, the largest decrease since September 2015, after tumbling 0.9% in the prior month. Wholesale food prices were unchanged last month after falling 1.6% in February. Core goods prices rose 0.2% in March. They edged down 0.1% in February.
The cost of services increased 0.2% in March, after dropping 0.3% in February. Services were lifted by a 1.4% jump in margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.

The cost of healthcare services was unchanged after gaining 0.2% in February. Portfolio management fees dropped 0.8% last month after February's 0.3% increase. They likely took a hit from a sharp sell-off in the stock market. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims exceed six million for second straight week,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits in the last three weeks has blown past 15 million, with weekly new claims topping 6 million for the second straight time last week amid tough measures to control the novel coronavirus outbreak that have abruptly ground the country to halt.
Thursday's weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department, the most timely data on the economy's health, strengthens economists' expectations of job losses of up to 20 million in April and their conviction that the economy is in deep recession. The government reported last Friday that the economy purged 701,000 jobs in March. That was the most job losses since the Great Recession and ended the longest employment boom in U.S. history that started in late 2010.
""In its first month alone, the coronavirus crisis is poised to exceed any comparison to the Great Recession,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. ""The new normal for unemployment insurance claims will be the canary in the coal mine for how long effects of the crisis will linger for the millions of newly unemployed Americans.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 261,000 to a seasonally adjusted 6.606 million for the week ended April 4, the government said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 219,000 more applications were received than previously reported, taking the tally for that period to 6.867 million. All told, more than 15 million people have filed claims for jobless benefits since the week ending March 21.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 5.250 million in the latest week, though estimates in the survey were as high as 9.295 million. 
The Labor Department said the coronavirus ""continues to impact the number of initial claims."" 
The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out a broad, $2.3 trillion effort to bolster local governments and small and mid-sized businesses in its latest move to keep the economy intact.
The dollar was little changed, while U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher. U.S. stock index futures reversed losses on the Fed's latest stimulus measures. 
With more than 95% of Americans under ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders, reports continue to mount of state employment offices being overwhelmed by a deluge of applications. As such, the moderation in claims last week is probably temporary. 
The breadth of businesses shuttered because of the stringent measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has expanded from bars, restaurants and other social gathering venues to transportation and factories. The United States has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the world.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED 
Businesses are also encouraging their lowest paid hourly workers to apply for unemployment benefits to take advantage of an extra $600 per week for up to four months. This enhancement is part of a historic $2.3 trillion rescue package and is on top of existing jobless benefits, which averaged $385 per person per month in January. 
It is equivalent to $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. The government-mandated minimum wage is about $7.25 per hour.
""The new $600 Federal payment alone still exceeds average earnings in leisure and hospitality by almost 50%,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. 
""This may in turn be part of the reason why jobless claims have soared so rapidly in recent weeks. Workers may be more accepting of temporary furloughs if they stand to lose little income, and several major retailers have cited the new provisions when announcing layoffs."" 
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid shot up 4.396 million to a record 7.455 million in the week ending March 28, obliterating the previous all-time high of 6.635 million set in May 2009.
The so-called continuing claims data is reported with a one-week lag and is viewed as a better gauge of unemployment and its impact on gross domestic product.
The unemployment rate rose 0.9 percentage point, the largest single-month change since January 1975, to 4.4% in March. The government said the rate could have been 5.4% if it were not for a misclassification error during the survey of households.
The economy is believed to have contracted sharply in the first quarter, with even an historic decline in GDP being forecast for the second quarter. Economists say the economy entered recession in March. 

The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.

Sentiment among store managers, barbers, taxi drivers and others who deal directly with Japanese consumers plummeted to a record low at the end of March, according to results Wednesday from a Cabinet Office survey that goes back to 2002.
The Economy Watcher’s survey is one of the first consumer-related data points released by the Japanese government each month, so it offers an early glimpse of how people on the ground are feeling about the fast-moving impact of the coronavirus.
An index in the survey measuring people’s view of their current circumstances showed more gloom than after 2011’s deadly tsunami disaster or during the global financial crisis. Another index of people’s outlook also fell to a record low.
And the situation is likely to have gotten worse since the survey. With infection numbers jumping recently, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Tuesday declared a state of emergency covering Japan’s main cities. He also unveiled a record aid package to stem the economic damage as the country hunkers down.
A separate report Wednesday from Tokyo Shoko Research showed Japanese bankruptcies jumped 12% in March from a year earlier. Business failures have increased by double-digits in each of the last four months. Some economists now see the economy shrinking more than 20% this quarter."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly rose in February, suggesting business investment remained resilient even as companies braced for a major jolt to demand from the coronavirus pandemic.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 2.3% in February from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
The rise followed a 2.9% gain in January and was better than a 2.7% decline predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
Many analysts expect the global economy to slip into recession due to the widening impact from the pandemic, which has already triggered financial market turmoil in recent weeks as investors brace for a sharp contraction.
Analysts expect the hit to consumption from the coronavirus to worsen in coming months after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency on Tuesday that is seen paralysing activity in major cities.
""Given that other activity indicators and the manufacturing surveys held up well, the resilience of machinery orders in February is not a surprise,"" said Capital Economics Japan Economist Tom Learmouth.
""A sharp downturn is in the pipeline though, which should partly be reflected in the March data. We're forecasting a 3% quarter-on-quarter fall in non-residential investment this quarter.""
Abe unveiled a stimulus package of almost $1 trillion on Tuesday that includes 39.5 trillion yen ($363 billion) in direct fiscal spending, largely to offset the immediate damage from the pandemic.
Japanese business confidence soured to a seven-year low in the quarter through March, a Bank of Japan (BOJ) survey showed last week, as the pandemic hit sectors from hotels to car makers.
By sector, manufacturers' orders edged down 1.7%, weighed by chemicals, while core orders from the service-sector rose 5.0%, led by gains in the transport and postal business.
The BOJ is set to hold its next meeting in three weeks after easing monetary policy last month by pledging to buy exchange-traded funds at double the current pace, joining global central banks in fighting the pain from the pandemic.
Analysts see Japan's economy, which shrank in the final quarter of last year, contracting over the following two quarters as the pandemic worsens.
From a year earlier, core machinery orders were down 2.4% in February, largely in line with a 2.9% decline seen by economists in a Reuters poll and after a 0.3% fall in January.

965,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings fall; coronavirus shutdowns seen causing further declines,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell in February, suggesting the labor market was losing momentum even before stringent measures to control the novel coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses, throwing millions out of work.
That was underscored by another report on Tuesday showing a sharp decline in the share of small businesses planning to increase employment in March. The reports came in the wake of data last week showing the economy shed 701,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate shot up 0.9 percentage point, the most since January 1975, to 4.4 percent in March.
With 10 million people filing for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks of March and millions more expected to have submitted claims last week, economists are expecting payrolls to sink by at least a record 20 million in April and the jobless rate to top 10%.
""The economy would be lucky to just be in a recession right now instead of what is looking more and more like the twilight zone of depression if Washington policymakers aren't careful,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 130,000 to 6.9 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. Vacancies peaked at 7.5 million in January 2019. The job openings rate slipped to 4.3% in February from 4.4% in January.
The decline in job openings was led by real estate and rental and leasing, and information industries. But there were 927,000 vacancies in the leisure and hospitality industry, with 783,000 of them at hotels, bars and restaurants. 
Retailers had 727,000 job openings in February. None of these vacancies likely exist now, with entire industries virtually closed.
Hiring was little changed at 5.9 million in February, keeping the hiring rate at 3.9% for a third straight month. JOLTS data in the coming months will be closely watched for clues on the impact of the coronavirus shutdowns on hiring.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as early signs of a slowdown in coronavirus cases in the nation's hot spots raised hopes that sweeping lockdown measures to contain the outbreak were working. The dollar (DXY) weakened against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell.
DEEP PAIN
""What we do not know yet is how much hiring has frozen in industries that have continued to operate by having the option of at-home work,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""A freeze on hiring due to the uncertainty about the duration and severity of the downturn as well as such tangible things as canceled or delayed contracts will create a secondary effect that will deepen the pain in the labor market.""
A separate report from the National Federation of Independent Business on Tuesday offered some early indications on hiring in the months ahead. According to the NFIB, the share of small businesses planning to increase hiring plummeted to 9% in March, the smallest since August 2016, from 21% in February. 
Overall, confidence among small business tumbled by the most on record to its lowest level since October 2016.
Economists say the labor market's fate will be determined by how quickly small businesses can access funding that has been put together by the government as part of a historic $2.3 trilling fiscal stimulus package. The Federal Reserve has also taken extraordinary measures to provide liquidity to businesses.
""The extraordinary stimulus efforts from the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve should support small businesses in coming months and help to keep workers on payrolls,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. 
""Still, the rollout and timing of the lending programs for small enterprises will be key to limiting the negative effects from the economic downturn."" 
The JOLTS report showed the number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs slipped to 3.5 million in February from 3.6 million in the prior month. The quits rate held at 2.3% for the sixth straight month.
The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. Layoffs rose to 1.8 million in February from 1.7 million in January. The layoffs rate increased to 1.2% from 1.1% in January. 

There were increases in layoffs in the real estate and rental and leasing sector, and the federal government.

The number of available positions eased to 6.88 million from an upwardly revised 7.01 million in January, according to the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released Tuesday. That compares with a median forecast for a decline to 6.5 million.
The figures provide insight into the extent of demand for workers before millions of Americans were laid off from their jobs as businesses closed during the national health emergency. Job openings have since likely plummeted as the pandemic eroded a vibrant labor market.

The National Federation of Independent Business optimism index slumped 8.1 points to 96.4, the group said in a report issued Tuesday, the biggest drop in monthly surveys going back to 1986. The group’s measure of business conditions six months from now declined 17 points, the most since November 2012, to 5.
Nine of the 10 components that make up the optimism gauge declined in March. Pessimism reflected the largest-ever decrease in sales expectations. The NFIB’s uncertainty index increased to a three-year high.
“Small businesses are living through the coronavirus pandemic right now and it’s hard to say what the severity of the disruption will be, but we do know they’re feeling the urgency,” William Dunkelberg, NFIB’s chief economist, said in a statement.
Beyond the disruptions from government-mandated shutdowns, small businesses are having difficulty submitting applications for loans being provided through the federal stimulus program, according to the report.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank kept rates at record lows on Tuesday and said it would do ""what is necessary"" to achieve its target of 0.25% for three-year government bond yields as it predicted a ""very large"" economic contraction next quarter.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on March 19 announced an out-of-cycle rate cut to 0.25% together with an unprecedented stimulus package, which included an unlimited bond buying programme.
On Tuesday, the board affirmed all the elements of that package and said it would not raise interest rates until it makes progress in achieving its employment and inflation goals. 
""There is considerable uncertainty about the near-term outlook for the Australian economy,"" Governor Philip Lowe said in a short post-meeting statement.
""Much will depend on the success of the efforts to contain the virus and how long the social distancing measures need to remain in place,"" Lowe added.
""A very large economic contraction is, however, expected to be recorded in the June quarter and the unemployment rate is expected to increase to its highest level for many years."" 
There is already growing evidence of a marked slowdown in activity as the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia creeps towards 6,000 with 46 deaths.
Restrictions on human movement and gatherings have forced many businesses in hospitality, retail, transport, education and even community services to shut down. Businesses that remain open face falling sales and increasing operational restrictions. 
Indeed figures out earlier in the day were ominous. 
The Australian Industry Group Australian Performance of Services Index plunged to 38.7 points in March, the lowest since March 2009 and the fourth month of contraction.
Separate figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) showed Australian job advertisements suffered their largest drop in more than a decade in March.
Another survey from ANZ and Roy Morgan also out on Tuesday showed consumer sentiment bounced last week after two months of drastic falls, as a government ""JobKeeper"" plan to subsidise some workers lightened the mood just a little.
The survey's main index rose 10.1% from the previous week, yet was still close to the lows seen in the recession of the early 1990s.
Economists fear unemployment could spike toward 10% in coming months as large chunks of the economy all but close to fight the virus. The jobless rate stood at 5.1% in February before rolling shutdowns threw many out of work.
""Prior to the JobKeeper payment announcement, we forecast that more than 1.1 million workers could lose their jobs and the unemployment rate could rise to a peak of 13%,"" said ANZ senior economist, Catherine Birch.
""However, we think the JobKeeper payment will keep more workers employed and reduce the peak in unemployment – the economic version of 'flattening the curve'.""
Australia's trade balance also narrowed a touch to A$4.36 billion ($2.67 billion) with earnings from tourism sliding 15% in February to be down A$1 billion in just two months, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Tuesday.

970,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>","Rush for masks, toilet paper slows Japan's household spending decline","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's consumer spending fell in February but at a slower-than-expected pace as households scrambled for protective masks, toilet paper and staple food amid the worsening coronavirus pandemic.
But spending on travel and entertainment slumped, government data showed on Tuesday, a sign households were cutting back on non-essential purchases even before travel bans and social distancing policies took effect in March.
Analysts expect the hit to consumption from the pandemic to deepen significantly in coming months, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declares a state of emergency on Tuesday that is likely to paralyse activity in major cities, including Tokyo, for a month.
""This pandemic is an unprecedented type of economic crisis that deals an immediate blow to consumption and jobs,"" said Yasuhide Yajima, chief economist at NLI Research Institute.
""We'll likely see a freefall in consumption in March and beyond of a scale never experienced before. In a crisis like this, Japan has little choice but to embark on helicopter money like other major economies,"" he said.
Household spending slid 0.3% in February from a year earlier, marking the fifth straight month of declines but a smaller drop than a median market forecast for a 3.9% decline and the 3.9% fall in January.
Spending on toilet paper jumped 47% in February from a year earlier, while that on domestic package tours slumped 37%.
A separate central bank survey for the March quarter showed Japanese households were the gloomiest on the economic outlook they had been since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, underscoring the toll the outbreak was taking on the world's third-largest economy.
Supply chain disruptions, travel bans and social distancing policies triggered by the pandemic have hit Japan's economy, which is already on the brink of recession, piling pressure on policymakers to take stronger steps to ease the pain.
Abe said on Tuesday the government's stimulus package to combat the pandemic would be among the world's biggest and include direct fiscal spending of $358 billion.
It was the first time the premier unveiled the size of direct spending of his package, which he said would total 108 trillion yen - equal to 20% of economic output.
The 39-trillion-yen ($358 billion) in spending would be more than double what Japan spent dealing with the hit to growth from the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
While the stimulus could ease the immediate damage from the pandemic, lawmakers are already calling for even bigger spending to prevent bankruptcies and job losses.
""Japan's economy will likely suffer a double-digit contraction in the current quarter. The damage from the outbreak could persist in July-September,"" said Takahide Kiuchi, a former Bank of Japan board member.
""The government will probably compile another supplementary budget soon to stimulate the economy with even more spending,"" said Kiuchi, now an economist at Nomura Research Institute.

The world's third-largest economy is expected to have slipped into recession - marked by two quarters of negative growth - in the March quarter as the coronavirus hit demand, led to travel bans and disrupted supply chains.
Real wages, a gauge of household purchasing power, gained 0.5% in February from a year earlier, labour ministry data showed, following a downwardly revised 0.4% rise in the previous month.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday said the government would launch a stimulus package of around 108 trillion yen. It was not immediately clear how much of that package would be new government spending.
The monthly wage data showed nominal total cash earnings rose 1.0% in the year to February after a revised 1.2% gain in January.
One-off special payments were up 21.5% in February after a downwardly revised 9.5% gain in January. Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings and determines a wage trend - grew 0.7%, the data showed.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, dropped 1.2% in February from a year earlier, down for a sixth straight month.

Revelations last year that labour ministry officials used faulty polling methods cast doubt on the accuracy of the ministry's wage data from 2004 to 2017. The flaw has made it harder to gauge the actual wage trend.

Production and demand for vehicles have been hammered across the world by lockdowns aimed at curtailing the coronavirus outbreak, which has spread from China to Europe, the United States and elsewhere. 
""The latest forecast takes the extended shutdown of auto plants in March and the supply chain disruption caused by the extended shutdown of the plants in Hubei province into consideration,"" IHS Markit said in a post on its social media wechat account.
""For Chinese automakers which purchase auto parts from Europe, the disruption of production in Europe may be a risk factor. But at this stage, we have not seen the European coronavirus epidemic directly affect Chinese auto production,"" IHS Markit added.
Last week, IHS Markit estimated China's light vehicle sales this year would drop 9.9% from last year to around 22.4 million vehicles, if China's central government does not roll out measures to boost auto demand.

China's Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), which expects China's overall auto sales to drop 5% this year, is calling on the government to help after industry-wide sales plunged a record 79% in February from a year earlier, with demand pummelled by the coronavirus pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction sector saw the sharpest fall in activity since the financial crisis last month, a survey showed on Monday, despite facing much less pressure than other industries to shut down operations due to the coronavirus.
The figures from financial data provider IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) also confirmed data last week that showed the British private sector as a whole is contracting at its fastest rate in more than 20 years.
The construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) tumbled to 39.3 in March from 52.6 in February, its lowest since April 2009 and well below economists' average forecast of 44.0.
The 13-point monthly fall was the largest since the survey began in 1997, and the index looks likely to worsen.
""The sector is stuck in quicksand and sinking further,"" Duncan Brock, group director at CIPS, said.
Britain's government has not required general construction work to stop to slow the spread of coronavirus - in contrast to its order for most shops and restaurants to close to the public, and for workers in other sectors to stay home if possible.
Nonetheless, IHS Markit said building companies reported stoppages last month as they sought to comply with guidance to keep workers 2 metres apart where safe to do so, as well as a big fall in new orders.
""Survey respondents widely commented on doubts about the feasibility of continuing with existing projects as well as starting new work,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
""Construction supply chains instead are set to largely focus on the provision of essential activities such as infrastructure maintenance, safety-critical remedial work and support for public services in the weeks ahead,"" he added.

Last week, IHS Markit's composite PMI for the manufacturing and services sectors fell to its lowest on record at 36.0 for March, and Monday's all-sector version including the construction industry was also a record low at 36.3.

Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to -42.9 from -17.1 in March. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a fall to -30.3.
The force of recession was much stronger in April than in March, said Sentix managing director Patrick Hussy.

In Germany, the sentiment index fell to -36.0 from -16.9 in March, sinking to its lowest since March, 2009.
The impact of the coronavirus crisis was being cushioned for many German workers by the social safety net, said Hussy.
""However, these only have a short-term effect and could at best postpone an adjustment reaction,"" said Hussy, adding that there was no clear turnaround in sight.

Sales totalled around 250,000 units, making it the weakest March -- typically one of the top two selling months of the year -- since 1999 when bi-annual plate changes were introduced.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a shutdown of much of the economy last month as his government sought to slow the spread of coronavirus. March accounted for nearly 20% of total registrations in 2019 as it is one of two annual occasions when a new licence plate series is issued.
Car sales in Britain have been falling since hitting a record high in 2016. The SMMT's latest forecast, published in January, predicted a drop in full-year demand of just over 2.5% to 2.25 million cars.

The figures published by the Statistics Office relate to the period before lockdown measures began to affect the German economy in earnest: domestic orders climbed by 1.7%, while orders from abroad shrank by 3.6%.
The overall fall was less than the 2.4% drop expected by analysts polled for Reuters.
But countries like China and Italy were already hard hit by the virus and some lockdown measures put in place in an attempt to suppress it in February.
""The orders data showed that the industrial recession in Germany was over before the outbreak of the pandemic,"" the Economy Ministry said as bookings for January were revised to a 4.8% increase.
""Given the global economic shock the pandemic is causing, however, we have to expect major falls in orders for March and April and sharp drops in production in the first and second quarters,"" it added.
Contracts from the euro zone were down 5% in February, while those from the rest of the world were down 2.7%. 
China is Germany's biggest trading partner. Manufacturers depend on both demand and supply chains from China.

GfK, which has conducted monthly surveys of British consumer sentiment since 1974, ran an extra poll in late March which showed the weakest sentiment since February 2009.
The drop in the index to -34 from -9 in its regular survey for March, conducted earlier in the month, was the biggest on record.
""Our COVID-19 'flash report' shows a dramatic result with consumer confidence falling off the cliff in the last two weeks of March,"" GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said.
Surveys of businesses have been similarly bleak. IHS Markit's monthly purchasing managers' index for the services and manufacturing sectors, published on Friday, pointed to the sharpest contraction on record. 
The biggest decline in the GfK survey came in households' willingness to make major purchases, despite a spike in demand for freezers, televisions and home office equipment as people prepared to spend most of their time at home.
GfK conducted the European Union-commissioned survey of 2,000 people between March 16 and March 27. Over this period Britain moved from advising people to avoid bars and restaurants to banning them from leaving their homes except to buy food, exercise or do essential work.

Economists fear Britain's economy, like many others around the world, is heading for a severe recession but say a bounce-back is possible later in the year, depending on how the coronavirus outbreak develops.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity slowed to a more than 3-1/2-year low in March, with industries reporting a moderation in new orders and decline in employment amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought the country to sudden stop. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Friday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 52.5 last month, the lowest since August 2016, from 57.3 in February. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dropping to a reading of 44.0 in March.
The smaller-than-expected decline in the non-manufacturing index reflected a jump in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 62.1 last month from 52.4 in February. A lengthening in suppliers' delivery time is normally associated with increased activity, which would be a positive contribution. In this case, however, slower supplier deliveries indicate supply shortages rather than stronger demand.
The ISM reported on Wednesday that manufacturing activity contracted in March, with new orders received by factories tumbling to an 11-year low.
Despite the vast services sector still appearing to be growing, although at a moderate pace, economists believe the economy slipped into recession in March, with 10 million Americans filing for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks of the month. The vast majority of Americans are now under some form of lockdown as authorities try to control the spread of the virus. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.

The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry fell to a reading of 52.9 in March, the lowest since August 2016, from 63.1 in February. The survey's index of services industry employment tumbled to 47.0 last month, the lowest reading since February 2010, from 55.6 in February.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy shed 701,000 jobs in the month to mid-March, the government said in a monthly labor market report that predates the worst of the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy.
The figures, normally the most eagerly-awaited data of the month in global financial markets, have already been rendered largely meaningless by the unprecedented spike in jobless claims over the subsequent two weeks. Nearly 10 million Americans – 6% of a total workforce of 164 million - have filed for unemployment benefit since the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ cut-off date of March 12.
Analysts had expected a drop of 100,000 in overall employment, according to an Investing.com poll, roughly in line with figures reported by private payrolls processor ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) earlier in the week.
According to think-tank Oxford Economics, the jobs lost are just the tip of the iceberg. Its analysts expect the U.S. economy to shed more jobs through May than it created in the whole of the expansion since 2009. Oxford's Greg Daco said he expects 24 million jobs to disappear in April.


As expected, the leisure and hospitality sector bore the brunt of the job losses, shedding 459,000 jobs.
According to the government’s data, the unemployment rate rose to 4.4% from a multi-year low of 3.5%, above forecasts for a rate of 3.8%. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told Bloomberg on Thursday that she expected the jobless rate to rise to 15% as regional lockdowns feed through into the data.
Average hourly earnings growth accelerated to 3.1%, while weekly hours worked fell to 34.2 from 34.4, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy looks set for a slump that in the short term could be deeper than during the depression of the 1930s, as a survey showed the coronavirus crisis caused a record downturn among services and manufacturing firms in March.
The composite Purchasing Managers' Index covering the two sectors fell to 36.0 from 53.0 in February and was weaker than a preliminary 'flash' reading of 37.1, data firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply said.
The survey data were collected between March 12 and March 27, covering the period after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the closure of bars, restaurants, gyms and other services businesses to slow the coronavirus outbreak on March 20.
Britain's dominant services industry suffered its sharpest fall by far since the survey began in 1996. Its index sank to 34.5 from February's 53.2, and was also weaker than the March flash reading of 35.7.
Sterling weakened almost half a cent against the dollar to its lowest since March 31 after the news, which was only a bit less bleak than the equivalent euro zone survey.
Andrew Wishart, an economist at Capital Economics, said the PMIs were probably underestimating the hit.
""We are forecasting a 15% fall in GDP in Q2, a larger fall in output than in the financial crisis or the Great Depression,"" he said.
""Our base case is that the recession won't be as protracted as either of those episodes. But evidence that unemployment is shooting up despite the government response raises the risk that the recovery takes longer than we expect.""
Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said job losses had been mitigated by firms' use of a government scheme to temporarily put staff on leave, rather than fire them.
Britain's government has said it will pay 80% of the wages of workers who are furloughed by companies.
""However, employment levels across the service sector still dropped at the fastest pace for more than a decade, reflecting some forced redundancies and the non-replacement of departing staff amid widespread hiring freezes,"" Moore said.
British Airways (L:ICAG) said on Thursday it had struck a deal with its unions to suspend more than 30,000 cabin crew and ground staff. Data on Wednesday showed around 950,000 people in the United Kingdom have applied for welfare benefits in the two weeks since Johnson shut down swathes of the economy.
The PMI survey showed the biggest drop in new work among services firms and the bleakest business expectations in more than 20 years of data collection.
Technology services were the only area to signal a rise in business activity - possibly reflecting the stay-at-home order for many people - but new workloads for tech firms dropped more quickly than at any time since 2011.

A final PMI for Britain's manufacturing sector, published on Wednesday, showed factory output shrank at the fastest pace since the euro zone debt crisis in March.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending likely fell for the fifth straight month in February, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, adding to growing signs of the pain the coronavirus pandemic is inflicting on an economy already on the cusp of recession.
Machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital expenditure, are also expected to have slumped in February, suggesting the world's third-largest economy is losing support from domestic demand before exports recover from the hit from last year's U.S.-China trade war.
Household spending is expected to have fallen 3.9% in February from a year earlier, a Reuters poll showed, matching January's decline as unusually warm weather hurt demand for winter clothing.
The impact from the coronavirus added to woes for consumption, which continued to suffer the fallout from a sales tax hike rolled out in October, analysts say.
""Food demand grew somewhat, but spending on most other goods were weak. Spending on services will likely slump ahead due to government requests for households to stay home,"" analysts at SMBC Nikko Securities wrote in a note.
Machinery orders likely fell 2.7% in March from the previous month, the poll showed, suggesting companies will scale back capital spending on prospects of slumping demand at home and overseas.
The government releases household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on April 7 (2350 GMT on April 6).
It will release machinery orders data at 8:50 a.m. on April 8 (2350 GMT on April 7).
Supply chain disruptions, travel bans and social distancing policies triggered by the pandemic have hit Japan's economy, which is already on the brink of recession.
Analysts expect Japan's economy, which shrank in the final quarter of last year, to suffer two more quarters of contraction as the pain from the pandemic deepens.

The world's third-largest economy is on the brink of recession after the coronavirus squashed hopes of a domestic-led recovery, ramping up pressure on policymakers to take major steps to support the economy.
The final seasonally adjusted au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slumped to 33.8 in March from 46.8 in the previous month.
The headline figure marked the lowest reading since February 2009 during the global financial crisis but was slightly above a preliminary 32.7 released last week.
The survey showed business expectations shrank at their fastest pace in a decade, while new business was at its lowest level in nearly eight years, suggesting firms are struggling with the virus outbreak.
Companies also reported business closures at key clients and event cancellations, IHS Markit said.
""The latest combined manufacturing and services PMI data already point to GDP contracting at an annual rate of around 8%,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""If the outbreak were to escalate in Japan such that widespread lockdowns are imposed, GDP in the second quarter could be poised for an annual decline in excess of 10%.""
The virus crisis led to a severe fall in client demand, forcing some firms to cut staffing numbers, with the data showing employment conditions turned negative for the first time since late 2016.
The economy shrank a more than initially estimated annualised 7.1% in the fourth quarter, revised data last month showed, raising fears of a deepening slowdown even before the pandemic.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday ordered his cabinet to compile an unprecedented package of steps to support the economy as the coronavirus threatened widespread disruption across the nation.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell to 36.2 in March from the previous month's final 47.0, coming in at the lowest level since March 2009.

While the adjusted IHS Markit headline Hong Kong Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) edged up to 34.9 in March, from 33.1 in February, it still signaled the second-sharpest deterioration of private sector conditions in the city since July 1998, when the survey began.
The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
""Key sectors of the economy such as retail, travel and tourism were decimated by the global coronavirus outbreak. Business activity across Hong Kong continued to contract at a severe pace in March, as new sales plummeted further,"" said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS Markit.
Hong Kong's small, open economy, which was already in recession, has been hit from all sides by the health crisis, particularly in the retail and tourism sectors. Retail sales fell by a record 44% in February from a year earlier. [nL4N2BM07S]
The trade outlook is also grim for the bustling port as increasing health lockdowns in many parts of the world crush global demand. While China's factories are gradually returning to work, growth is still well below usual levels and new orders from the mainland remain close to the record low seen in February.
With orders drying up, companies continued to cut back production, though the survey's output gauge ticked up to 26.0 after plummeting to 22.5 in February. New orders also showed another severe contraction.
""The average PMI for the first quarter suggests that the Hong Kong SAR economy had fallen deeper into recession. There are also concerns that the downturn will worsen in the second quarter as more drastic anti-virus measures may be taken worldwide,"" said Aw.

Business confidence, a forward-looking subcomponent in the survey, fell to its second-lowest since the data were first available in April 2012, with 59 percent of the survey respondents predicting lower output over the next 12 months due to uncertainties over the economic impact of the virus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits shot to a record high of more than 6 million last week as more jurisdictions enforced stay-at-home measures to curb the coronavirus pandemic, which economists say has pushed the economy into recession.
Thursday's weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department, the most timely data on the economy's health, reinforced economists' views that the longest employment boom in U.S. history probably ended in March. With a majority of Americans now under some form of lockdown, claims are expected to rise further. 
Economists said worsening job losses underscored the need for additional fiscal and monetary stimulus. President Donald Trump last week signed a historic $2.3 trillion package, with provisions for companies and unemployed workers. The Federal Reserve has also undertaken extraordinary measures to help companies weather the highly contagious virus, which has brought the country to a halt.
""These data underscore the magnitude of the stop-work order that has been imposed on the economy,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""The scale of the increase should also focus policymakers on getting the cash into the economy with possibly a fourth fiscal package and additional Fed lending programs.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 3.341 million to a seasonally adjusted 6.648 million for the week ended March 28, the government said. That was double the previous all-time high of 3.307 million set in the prior week.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would jump to 3.50 million in the latest week, though estimates were as high as 5.25 million. The number of people on unemployment rolls shot up 1.245 million to 3.029 million in the week ended March 21, the highest since July 6, 2013.
The United States has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, with more than 214,000 people infected. Nearly 5,000 people in the country have died from the illness, according to a Reuters tally. 
The Labor Department said states continued to identify layoffs related to COVID-19 across a broad array of industries, including accommodation and food services, health care and social assistance, manufacturing industries, retail, wholesale trade and construction industries.
""Similar to last week's unemployment claims numbers, today's report reflects the sacrifices American workers are making for their families, neighbors, and country in order to slow the spread,"" U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said in a statement.
The dollar (DXY) was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street gained as a recovery in oil prices outweighed the shock of the jobless claims data.

VIRUS DEPRESSES IMPORTS
The coronavirus pandemic's disruptive impact was highlighted by a separate report from the U.S. Commerce Department on Thursday showing a collapse in Chinese imports, resulting in the U.S. trade deficit narrowing 12.2% to $39.9 billion in February, the lowest level since September 2016.
While the shrinking trade gap is a positive in the calculation of gross domestic product, declining imports mean less inventory accumulation, which could offset the contribution to GDP. The shortages stemming from meager imports are weighing on consumer spending and production at factories, which could lead to further job losses.
Economists believe the economy slipped into recession in March. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
""The U.S. economy is now in recession,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""Enormous job losses could do tremendous long-lasting damage to the economy that would weaken any eventual recovery.""
Applications for unemployment benefits peaked at 665,000 during the 2007-2009 recession, when 8.7 million jobs were lost. Unadjusted claims in California soared 692,394 last week. New York, another COVID-19 hot spot, reported an increase of 286,404.
Economists say the country should brace for jobless claims to continue escalating, partly citing generous provisions of the fiscal package and the federal government's easing of requirements for workers to seek benefits. 
As a result, self-employed and gig workers who previously were unable to claim unemployment benefits are now eligible. In addition, the unemployed will get an additional $600 per week for up to four months. This is on top of existing jobless benefits, which averaged $385 per person per month in January, and is equivalent to $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. 
By comparison, the government-mandated minimum wage is about $7.25 per hour. Last week's claims data has no bearing on the closely watched employment report for March, which is scheduled for release on Friday. The government surveyed businesses and households in the middle of the month for the employment report, when just a handful of states were enforcing ""stay-at-home"" or ""shelter-in-place"" orders.
It is, however, a preview of the carnage that awaits. Retailers, including Macy's (N:M), Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) and Gap Inc (N:GPS), said on Monday they would furlough tens of thousands of employees, as they prepare to keep stores shut for longer.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government report on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls dropped by 100,000 jobs last month after a robust increase of 273,000 in February. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise three-tenths of a percentage point to 3.8% in March.
""The broader stimulus package contains many weaknesses that reduce its effectiveness, which is regrettable because the job loss we have seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Heidi Shierholz, a former chief economist at the Labor Department.

""Based on new GDP forecasts, we project that nearly 20 million workers will be laid off or furloughed by July, with losses in every state,"" added Shierholz, now a policy director at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the unchanged reading in factory orders followed a 0.5% decline in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would increase 0.2% in February.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported on Wednesday that its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 49.1 in March from 50.1 in February. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. 
As well as causing disruptions in supply chains, the coronavirus pandemic has shut down demand, with the transportation industry almost crawling to a halt, and restaurants, bars and other social venues shutting. 
The government also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, fell 0.9% in February instead of declining 0.8% as reported last month.

Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, decreased 0.8 in February, rather than falling 0.7% as previously reported.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit dropped to near a 3-1/2-year low in February as the coronavirus pandemic pushed imports from China to their lowest level since 2009.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit fell 12.2% to $39.9 billion, the lowest level since September 2016. The percentage decline was the largest since March 2018.
Data for January was revised slightly to show the trade gap tightening to $45.5 billion instead of $45.3 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap would decrease to $40.0 billion in February.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit tumbled $9.0 billion to $69.0 billion in February. That was the lowest since February 2015. While the smaller so-called real trade deficit is a positive in the calculation of gross domestic product, declining imports means less inventory accumulation, which could offset the contribution to GDP.
The economy is, however, believed to have contracted in the first quarter as strict measures by states and local governments to control the spread of the coronavirus from mid-March brought the country to a sudden halt, triggering a wave of layoffs. That would be the first quarterly contraction since early 2014.
Economists believe the economy is already in recession. 
The National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research institute regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions, does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. 
Instead, it looks for a drop in activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months. 
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China dropped to $16.0 billion, the lowest since March 2009. Imports from China in February were the lowest since May 2009. Exports to China were the fewest since June 2010. 
In February, goods imports fell 2.4% to $198.4 billion. That was the lowest since October 2017, and reflected decreases in imports of capital goods, industrial supplies and materials, consumer goods.

Goods exports rose 0.7% to $137.2 billion in February.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits surged to a new record 6.65 million last week, the U.S. Labor Department said on Thursday, as the full impact of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic on the labor market became apparent.
The increase dwarfed the prior week’s figure of 3.28 million and eclipsed the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982.
The number of people already receiving benefits increased to 3.029 million, the report said.
Ahead of the report, Goldman Sachs had revised up its estimate for jobless claims to 6 million, adding it expected claims to remain very elevated in the coming weeks.
""Jobless claims will be the timeliest hard data point for assessing the depth of the recession and catching the start of the recovery,"" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a note to clients.
The numbers come ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for March on Friday. Due to the timing of the survey period for the government report it likely preceded the worst of the impact on the labor market.
Economists still expect the figures to show a loss of 100,000 jobs.
A report from payroll processor ADP on Wednesday showed that the U.S. private sector shed 27,000 jobs in March, but took March 12 as its cut-off date, before the worst of the impact of the pandemic on the U.S. labor market was seen. It was still the first decline in private sector hiring since September 2017.

""Over a quarter (27%) of responding businesses said they were reducing staff levels in the short term, while 5% reported recruiting staff in the short term,"" the Office for National Statistics said.
The survey of 3,642 businesses was conducted between March 9 and March 22, covering just a small part of the period after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a shutdown of much of the country's economy on March 20.
Another survey published earlier on Thursday, by the British Chamber of Commerce which was conducted between March 25 and March 27, suggested almost half British companies expected to temporarily lay off 50% or more of their workforce.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak has said the British state will pay 80% of the wages - up to 2,500 pounds a month - for workers who are temporarily laid off but remain on companies' books in an attempt to soften an expected surge in unemployment.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain has shed close to 900,000 jobs, more than half of them temporary, since it went into lockdown in mid-March to fight the coronavirus outbreak, social security data showed on Thursday.
Spain, which has the world's second-highest death toll from the disease after Italy, has banned all but essential outings since March 14. This week it further tightened the lockdown with a ban on all but essential workers leaving home to go to work.
The data showed 898,822 Spaniards have now lost their jobs since the start of the lockdown, including around 550,000 temporary workers. The tourism and construction sectors are the hardest hit.
""It is always a big problem and it is the double challenge we have: to fight the epidemic and to avoid the economic activity being swept away,"" Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos told RNE radio. ""We will have to work on relaunching the economy once we can get control of the epidemic."" 
The number of people officially registered as unemployed in Spain rose to 3.5 million in March, the highest level since April 2017. That data does not include all the new job losses as not all workers officially registered as unemployed.
""This is an absolutely unprecedented situation,"" Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz told a news conference, adding that this was the biggest monthly increase in unemployment ever recorded in Spain.
""PRACTICALLY PARALYSED""
Neither the social security nor the unemployment data include the so-called ""ERTE"" temporary layoffs, under which companies that face financial difficulties can temporarily suspend a worker's contract.
Many companies, including car plants and other major businesses, have implemented such temporary layoff measures over the past weeks.
""The country is practically paralysed as a result of the health emergency,"" Unai Sordo, the leader of Spain's biggest labour union CCOO, told TVE broadcaster.
March is usually a good month for employment in Spain because it marks the start of the holiday season, with many temporary workers finding jobs in particular in the hospitality sector.
However hotels, restaurants and bars are currently shut because of the coronavirus lockdown. Social security data shows they are the worst-hit sectors, together with construction.

""The destruction of jobs is extraordinarily heavy for women, young people and the most precarious work sectors, especially the hotel and restaurant sector and construction workers,"" Pepe Álvarez, leader of the UGT union, Spain's second-biggest union told RNE radio.

Prices grew by 3.0% compared with March 2019, Nationwide said, their biggest rise since January 2018 and stronger than a median forecast for a 2.0% increase in a Reuters poll of economists.
""It is important to note that, while we use a full month's worth of data to generate the index, the cut-off point is slightly before the end of the month,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. 
""This means that developments following the UK government's lockdown will not be reflected in these figures.""
As well ordering many companies to shut to slow the spread of coronavirus, the government has urged people to avoid moving house during the outbreak.
""A lack of transactions will make gauging house price trends difficult in the coming months,"" Gardner said. ""The medium-term outlook for the housing market is also highly uncertain, where much will depend on the performance of the wider economy.""
He said the government's emergency measures to try to companies and jobs should lead to a strong rebound in the economy once the coronavirus shock passes. 
""These same measures should also help ensure the impact on the housing market will ultimately be much less than would normally be associated with an economic shock of this magnitude,"" Gardner said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity contracted less than expected in March, but disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic pushed new orders received by factories to an 11-year low, reinforcing economists' views that the economy was in recession.
The economy's outlook was further dimmed by other data on Wednesday showing private payrolls dropped last month for the first time in 2-1/2 years as businesses shut down in compliance with strict measures to contain the highly contagious virus. 
The grim economic picture has forced the Federal Reserve to take extraordinary measures, and President Donald Trump last Friday signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package.
""Manufacturing is back in recession, joining the rest of the economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""With only a few actual data points so far, the results indicate this is looking more like a depression than a garden-variety recession.""
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 49.1 last month from 50.1 in February. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would drop to 45.0 in March.
The smaller-than-expected drop in the ISM index reflected a jump in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 65.0 this month from 57.3 in February. A lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with increased activity, which would be a positive contribution to the index. But in this case slower supplier deliveries indicate supply shortages related to the coronavirus pandemic and not stronger demand.
The ISM said comments from manufacturers ""were negative regarding the near-term outlook, with sentiment clearly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and energy market volatility.""
More than 80% of Americans are under some form of lockdown as states and local governments try to contain the spread of the virus, bringing the nation to an abrupt stop. The United States has the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, with nearly 188,000 people infected. Almost 4,000 people in the country have died from the illness, according to a Reuters tally.
As well as causing disruptions in supply chains, the pandemic has shut down demand, with the transportation industry almost crawling to a halt, and restaurants, bars and other social venues shutting. 
Those business closures resulted in private payrolls falling by 27,000 jobs last month, the first decline since September 2017, the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed separately on Wednesday. Private payrolls advanced by an unrevised 183,000 in February. The payrolls drop in March was concentrated among small businesses, while larger companies added workers.
""Looking ahead, the timing and strength of the recovery is highly uncertain so long as major parts of the domestic economy are on virtual lockdown and external demand remains in the doldrums,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Economists had forecast private payrolls would fall by 150,000 jobs in March. The smaller-than-expected decline was due to establishments being surveyed in mid-March, before many states and local governments ordered residents to stay at home unless on essential business. 
The dollar (DXY) was trading higher against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly higher. Major indexes on Wall Street tumbled on the data and Trump's warning on Tuesday that the country faced a tough two weeks ahead in its battle against the coronavirus.[

The ADP report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for March, which is scheduled for release on Friday. While it has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report because of methodology differences, economists said it could offer some clues on the size of anticipated job losses in March. 
Economists believe the longest employment boom in U.S. history, which started October 2010, came to an end in March.

The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to a reading of 42.2 in March, the lowest since March 2009, from 49.8 in February. Manufacturers also reported paying less for raw materials and other inputs. The survey's measure of factory employment decreased to a reading of 43.8 last month, the lowest since May 2009, from 46.9 in February.
The deteriorating labor market picture is likely to be underscored by the Labor Department's weekly jobless claims report on Thursday, which is expected to show the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits hit a new all-time high last week after vaulting to a record 3.28 million in the week ended March 21.

That was a downward revision from the 'flash' figure of 49.2 reported last week and lower than 50.7 reported in February.

It was the first decline in private sector hiring since September 2017. Economists had expected the report to show a much larger loss of 150,000 jobs, while February’s figure was revised to 179,000 from the 183,000 initially reported.
“It is important to note that the ADP National Employment Report is based on the total number of payroll records for employees who were active on a company’s payroll through the 12th of the month. This is the same time period the Bureau of Labor and Statistics uses for their survey,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute.
“As such, the March NER does not fully reflect the most recent impact of COVID-19 on the employment situation, including unemployment claims reported on March 26, 2020.”
The ADP numbers come ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for March on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Due to the timing of the survey period for Friday’s report it likely preceded the worst of the impact on the labor market. Economists still expect the figures to show a loss of 100,000 jobs.
Ahead of that, Thursday’s jobless claims report is expected to show another huge surge of new claims for unemployment benefits in the week to March 28, after they leaped to a record 3.28 million in the preceding week.

The Mortgage Bankers Association’s purchase index dropped 10.8% in the period ended March 27 after tumbling 14.6% -- the worst two weeks since May 2010, data from the Washington-based group showed Wednesday.
While home buying is falling victim to the pandemic-related economic stop, mortgage refinancing increased for the first time in three weeks, indicating the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cuts and massive purchases of mortgage-backed securities may be starting to bear fruit.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",Factory activity plunges as coronavirus shock deepens,"By Jonathan Cable and Leika Kihara
LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Factories fell quiet across most of Europe and Asia in March as the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed economic activity, with evidence mounting that the world is sliding into deep recession.
Manufacturing activity has tumbled, purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys showed on Wednesday, with sharp slowdowns in export powerhouses like Germany and Japan overshadowing a modest improvement in China.
The virus pandemic has infected more than 850,000 people around the globe and forced factories, shops and schools to close amid government-imposed lockdowns. 
This has upended supply chains and crushed demand for goods as consumers worried about job prospects rein in their spending and stay indoors.
In the euro zone, IHS Markit's final March manufacturing PMI sank to lowest since mid-2012, when the currency union's debt crisis was raging, and was well below the mark separating growth from contraction. [EUR/PMIM]
Data from the United States later on Wednesday is likely to show a sharp decline in factory activity there too as authorities enforce strict lockdown measures to control the spread of the virus. (reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=USPMI%3DECI poll)
U.S. consumer confidence has dropped to a near three-year low as the pandemic shakes people's lives, with a record number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. 
Output from Britain's factories shrank at the fastest pace since the debt crisis as the spread of coronavirus led to a spiraling of delays and hammered business confidence. [GB/PMIM]
""With consumers clamping down on all discretionary spending in the current uncertain environment, the manufacturing sector inevitably will struggle further,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics. 
Global fund managers polled by Reuters are convinced the world economy is already in recession, similar to economists' assessments in another Reuters poll. [ASSET/WRAP][ECILT/WRAP]
As the prospect of a deep recession grows, traders on Wednesday made a fresh dart for the safety of government bonds, the dollar <.USD=> and gold .
CHINA HEALING?
Chinese factory activity improved slightly more than expected after plunging a month earlier, its PMI showed, but growth was marginal, highlighting the intense pressure facing businesses as domestic and export demand slumps. 
While factories in China gradually restarted operations after lengthy shutdowns and a fall in virus cases allowed the country to start relaxing travel restrictions, activity in South Korea shrank at its fastest pace in 11 years as many of its trading partners imposed dramatic measures to curb the virus' spread.
""If you look at the Korean numbers, they're fairly bad ... They're likely to get worse still because Korea will be dependent on parts from Europe and the United States,"" said Rob Carnell, Asia-Pacific chief economist at ING in Singapore.
""(Policymakers) have to accept the inevitable that there is a massive global pandemic here, there is an outbreak in almost every country globally and certainly in our region, which is getting to levels that if they don't take very dramatic action, it's going to get much worse,"" he said.
Japan's factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in about a decade in March, adding to views that the world's third-largest economy is likely already in recession.
A separate ""tankan"" survey by the Bank of Japan showed business sentiment soured to a seven-year low in the three months to March, as the outbreak hit sectors from hotels to carmakers.
""The tankan clearly shows a sharp deterioration in business sentiment and confirms the economy is already in recession,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
China's Caixin/Markit PMI rose to 50.1 last month from February's record low of 40.3 and just a notch above breakeven mark, while South Korea's IHS Markit PMI plunged to its lowest since January 2009 when the economy was reeling from the global financial crisis. 
In Japan, where the PMI fell to its lowest since April 2009, the ruling coalition has called on the government to secure a stimulus package worth at least 60 trillion yen ($553 billion).
""Things are likely to get a lot worse in the months ahead,"" Alex Holmes at Capital Economics said in a note to clients, noting the survey period for the PMIs likely didn't capture more recent lockdowns such as those in Malaysia and Thailand.
The consultancy expects global gross domestic product (GDP) to fall by more than 3% this year.
Policymakers across the globe have announced massive monetary and fiscal stimulus measures to try to mitigate the economic fallout from the pandemic, keep cash-starved businesses afloat and save jobs.
But many measures have been short-gap steps to deal with the immediate damage to corporate funding and shore up banking systems amid worries of a credit crisis.

The International Monetary Fund has said the pandemic was already driving the global economy into recession, calling on countries to respond with ""very massive"" spending to avoid bankruptcies and emerging market debt defaults.

Retail group J.Front Retailing Co Ltd (T:3086) said it suffered its worst year-on-year decline on record, as sales at its Daimaru Matsuzakaya department store chain fell 43% in March from a year earlier.
Takashimaya Co Ltd (T:8233) reported a 36% fall. The year-on-year fall was particularly steep at its stores in Shinjuku and Osaka, it said.
Nationwide data for March has not yet been compiled, but the year-on-year declines at the major stores last month were far bigger than the 15 percent fall recorded in the wake of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, according to the Japan Department Stores Association.
Visitors to Japan have declined since China banned overseas group tours in January, and dwindled further as the virus outbreak spread in Japan and other countries, bringing international travel to a halt.

The jobless rate was 7.3% in the 19 countries sharing the euro zone, the lowest level since March 2008, EU statistics office Eurostat said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to be unchanged from the 7.4% of January.
In the 27-member European Union unemployment was 6.5% of the workforce, unchanged from January and so holding at the lowest rate recorded since the start of monthly data in February 2000.
Eurostat estimated that 12.047 million people in the euro area and 13.984 million people in the wider EU were unemployed in February, declines of respectively 88,000 and 62,000 respectively.
Unemployment ranged from 2.0% in the Czech Republic and 2.9% in the Netherlands and Poland to 13.6% in Spain and 16.3% in Greece.

The final version of the IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slumped to 47.8 -- its lowest since July 2012 -- from 51.7 in February, slightly weaker than a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 48.0 recorded earlier in March.
Transport delays and raw materials shortages led to the steepest increase in vendor lead times in the PMI's 28-year history and business optimism slumped to the lowest level on record. Job losses were the most severe since July 2009.
""The effects were felt across most of manufacturing, with output falling sharply in all major sectors except food production and pharmaceuticals,"" Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said.
""The transport sector, which includes already-beleaguered car-makers, suffered the steepest downturn."" 
The survey was conducted March 12-26, including the days immediately after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a shutdown of much of the country's economy on March 23.
A final version of IHS Markit's survey for Britain's dominant services sector, which has been hardest hit by the closure of bars, restaurants, gyms and other businesses, is due to be published on Friday.
Many economists have predicted Britain's economy, like others around the world, is heading for a contraction of possibly 10% or more in the second quarter, worse even than during the Depression nearly century ago.
In the hope of keeping companies alive while the shutdown lasts, Britain's government has announced ten of billions of pounds worth of stimulus and 330 billion pounds of state loan guarantees. The Bank of England has ramped up its bond-buying and cut interest rates to an all-time low of 0.1%.

Dobson said there was one slightly more positive detail in Tuesday's survey: manufacturers expected to see output higher in one year's time.

1007,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>",French manufacturing plunges into deepest slump in seven years: PMI,"PARIS (Reuters) - French manufacturing activity fell in March at the fastest pace in more than seven years as a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak hits companies and their clients, a monthly survey showed on Wednesday.
Data compiler IHS Markit said its final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 43.2 points from 49.8 in February, slightly higher than a preliminary reading of 42.9.
The plunge to its lowest point since January 2013 brought the index far away from the key 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
Meanwhile, manufacturers' output and the flow of orders for new business fell to their lowest levels since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis that unleashed one of the deepest recessions in decades in many major economies.
As the coronavirus spread in France, the government imposed a lockdown on March 17, forcing large swathes of the euro zone's second-biggest economy to shut down.
""The supply of goods is diminished, with supplier delivery times lengthening sharply and staff unable to work amid factory closures,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""Meanwhile, restricted movement of people and social distancing has acted to stifle demand, delivering a double-barrelled blow to the economy,"" he added.
The INSEE official statistics agency estimated last week that the economy was operating at two-thirds of its normal level, which was likely to knock 3 percentage points off growth for each month the country spends in lockdown.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>",Coronavirus sinks German manufacturing output in March: PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's export-dependent manufacturing sector saw the steepest decrease in output in almost 11 years in March, a survey showed on Wednesday, as the coronavirus pandemic forced plant closures in Europe's biggest economy.
IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the German economy, fell to 45.4, lower than both a flash reading of 45.7 and February's mark of 48.0. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in activity.
The sharpest drop in manufacturing output since April 2009, when the global financial crisis was raging, was led by a sharp decrease across the investment goods category, which includes carmakers and machine equipment.
""There's scope for the numbers to get even worse before they get better, as most containment measures and factory shutdowns happened either during or after the survey data were collected (between 12-24 March),"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.
German companies, including carmakers and car parts manufacturers, have been closing facilities and switching workers to shorter working hours to avoid mass layoffs.
The consumer goods sector was one bright spot in the survey. While it saw falls in output and new orders, it benefited from higher demand for food and cleaning products due to stockpiling unleashed by the crisis, as well as protective clothing.

The IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 40.3 in March from 48.7 in February.
The latest figure was the lowest since April 2009, during the global financial crisis. It was far below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, pointing to a deep manufacturing recession.
The data was broadly in line with expectations after grim PMI surveys in other European countries published last week. A Reuters poll of eight analysts had pointed to a reading of 40.5.
IHS Markit said its sub-index for output at manufacturers dived to 27.8 from 46.9, the lowest reading since the series began in June 1997. The new orders index also plummeted.
The euro zone's third-largest economy was already teetering near recession before the coronavirus hit, with gross domestic product declining by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of last year from the previous three months.
With all businesses closed bar those deemed essential to the country's supply chain, and draconian restrictions on people's freedom of movement, economists forecast a steep GDP decline this year.
Forecasts range widely, with Italian employers' lobby Confindustria forecasting a 6% annual contraction, and investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimating -11.6%.

On the year, retail sales jumped 6.4% on an adjusted basis, far outstripping the expectations of analysts, who had forecast an increase of just 1.5%. On the month, sales rose by 1.2%.
The spike in demand by households preparing for restrictions on going out and possible quarantine has already seen Germany-wide shortages of toilet roll and introduced the world to ""hamster shopping"", the German phrase for panic-buying.
Sales rose across the board, the German Statistical Office said, but growth was particularly strong in food, drinks and tobacco, where revenues were 7.8% higher than in February 2019. Supermarkets were the main beneficiaries, with revenues up 8.3%, compared to specialist retailers' growth of 3.5%.
The retail figures are a rare chink of light for Europe's largest economy, which has been hit by the coronavirus epidemic and is expected to fall into recession this year.
Non-food sales also rose sharply, up 5.6% compared to February last year in real terms. Online and delivery services saw particularly strong growth, with revenues up 11% compared to the year before.

Pharmacies and cosmetics retailers also saw sales rise by 6.6%.

Figures from consultancy CoreLogic on Wednesday showed home prices across Australia's capital cities climbed 0.7% in March, the lowest monthly rise since the property market turned around in July last year. Home values are up 8.9% from a year ago.
Sydney clocked a monthly gain of 1.1%, taking its annual rise to 13%, while Melbourne was up 0.4% for the month and 12% higher on a year-on-year basis.
CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless noted the country was moving into a period of ""unprecedented uncertainty"" which would drag the country's economy into a recession for the first time in 30 years.
The number of coronavirus cases in Australia now exceeds 4,500 with 20 deaths. Authorities, worried about the spread of infection within the community, have rolled out increasingly restrictive measures to combat the virus. 
""The housing market won't be immune to a drop in sentiment and weaker economy, however the extent of the impact of dwelling values remains highly uncertain,"" Lawless said.
He added that the number of residential property sales was expected to ""fall dramatically"" over coming months while restrictions on open home inspections and on-site auctions would compound the slowdown in activity.

However, housing values were likely to be insulated given the temporary nature of the crisis and the raft of policy stimulus measures undertaken by the government and the country's central bank, Lawless said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank was worried about the potential for a ""very material contraction"" in economic activity when it unveiled quantitative easing in an emergency meeting last month, minutes released on Wednesday showed.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held an out-of-cycle meeting on March 18 when it reduced its cash rate to a record low 0.25% and embarked on a bond buying programme to shield the economy from the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The minutes showed members agreed the cash rate was now at its effective lower bound and that policymakers had ""no appetite"" for negative interest rates, implying further cuts were not on the cards.
The RBA holds its next monthly rate review on April 7.
It noted the extraordinary measures ""would not have been under consideration in normal times."" 
Members said in discussions that it was not possible to provide an updated set of economic forecasts, given the ""fluidity of the situation"" though it was ""likely that Australia would experience a very material contraction"", the minutes showed.
The number of coronavirus cases in Australia now exceeds 4,500 with 20 deaths. Authorities, worried about the spread of infection within the community, have rolled out increasingly restrictive measures to combat the virus. 
Economists said the key for policy now was the extent of RBA's bond buying programme.
The central bank has so far been active in the market every business day since launching QE on March 20, lapping up about A$24 billion ($14.70 billion) worth of Australian sovereign and state government bonds.
SIGNIFICANT JOB LOSSES
Economists noted the sombre tone of the meeting but said the minutes failed to provide major insights into the RBA's thinking.
""While the RBA has not released an updated set of macro forecasts, the minutes hinted at substantial revisions amid much uncertainty,"" RBC economist Su-Lin Ong said.
""Coupled with a reluctance to take the cash rate into negative territory and the most recent large fiscal package, it suggests that the RBA is likely to sit on its hands for some time.""
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pledged A$320 billion in fiscal support or more than 15% of annual economic output in a bid to keep the economy running.
The RBA warned the economic contraction in Australia could potentially linger beyond the June quarter. 
""The size of the fall in economic activity would depend on the extent of the social distancing requirements, and potential lockdowns, put in place to contain the virus,"" minutes showed.

""There were likely to be significant job losses over the months ahead, although the extent of this would depend on the capacity of businesses to retain employees during this period.""

The manufacturing slowdown offers the latest evidence of the pain business and the economy are feeling from the pandemic and highlights the challenges policymakers face.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 44.8 from a final 47.8 in February, its lowest since April 2009.
""The likelihood of the manufacturing recession deepening in the coming months is high,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""Overall, the cascading impact of COVID-19 on the global economy is diminishing the chances of a V-shaped recovery.""
The PMI survey showed output and new orders fell to levels not seen since April 2011 - the month after an earthquake and tsunami ravaged Japan - with some companies reporting outright production halts.
New export orders fell sharply amid reports of severe economic distress among key trading partners in China and other parts of Asia.
Manufacturers reported the most negative outlook for output over the next 12 months since IHS Markit started tracking the future outlook in July 2012.
Big manufacturers turned pessimistic for the first time in seven years in the three months to March, a central bank survey showed earlier on Wednesday, further ramping up pressure on policymakers.
Japan's economy shrank at the fastest rate in 5-1/2 years in the December quarter due to the hit from a sales tax hike and the U.S.-China trade war. Many analysts see it slipping into recession - two straight quarters of contraction - this quarter as the virus hits the global economy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers turned pessimistic for the first time in seven years in the three months to March, the central bank's ""tankan"" survey showed, as the coronavirus pandemic pushed the economy closer to recession.
Non-manufacturers' sentiment also worsened to levels not seen in seven years as travel bans, event cancellations and social distancing policies hurt consumption, the Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" quarterly survey showed on Wednesday, clouding an already darkening outlook for the economy.
The data underscores the challenge Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces in stopping the pandemic wiping out the benefits his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies have brought to the economy.
The headline index measuring big manufacturers' sentiment worsened to minus 8 in March from zero in December, the survey showed, compared with a median market forecast of minus 10.
It was the first time in seven years the big manufacturers' index turned negative.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment index worsened to plus 8 from plus 20 in December, the survey showed, the worst reading in seven years.
Big firms expect to increase capital expenditure by 1.8% in the fiscal year that began in April, compared with a median estimate of a 1.1% decrease, the survey showed.
Both manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen further three months ahead, it showed.
The pandemic has hit an economy that had already suffered the fastest contraction in 5-1/2 years in the December quarter due to last year's sales tax hike and the U.S.-China trade war.
Many analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to contract in January-March and the current quarters, keeping pressure on policymakers to deploy huge stimulus programs.
Abe has pledged a huge spending package that would be bigger than one launched during the global financial crisis to cushion the outbreak's hit to growth.
The BOJ also stands ready to ramp up stimulus for the second straight month in April to combat the widening damage from the pandemic, sources have told Reuters.
The tankan survey will be among key data the BOJ will analyze in deciding policy at its April 27-28 rate review.

The tankan's sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.

The AIB IHS Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 45.1 from February's 51.2, its worst reading since May 2009 and well below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
The month-on-month drop, at 6.1 points, was the largest since the survey began in May 1998, surpassing the 5.7 point fall recorded in February 2009 as the global financial crisis raged, the survey's authors said.
The new orders sub-index plunged a record 14.1 points to 38.2 from 52.3 in February. The 12-month outlook for production was the worst on record.
""The PMI data confirm that there was an abrupt and steep fall in manufacturing in March,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said. ""Worse is to come, but there is also scope for a sharp rebound in activity when the coronavirus pandemic abates.""
A six-year expansion in Irish manufacturing came to an end in June as a slowdown in global trade and uncertainty over Britain's departure from the European Union finally caught up with manufacturers in the bloc's fastest-growing economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a near three-year low in March as households worried about the economy's near-term outlook amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended life for Americans.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday came in the wake of reports last week showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits racing to a record 3.28 million in the week ending March 21, and business activity hitting an all-time low in March. The country has ground to a sudden stop as authorities enforce strict measures to control the spread of the coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19.
The United States has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 163,000 people infected. At least 3,017 people in the U.S. have died from the illness, according to a Reuters tally.
The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary measures and President Donald Trump last Friday signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to ease the blow on the economy, which economists believe is already in recession.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index decreased to a reading of 120.0 this month, the lowest since July 2017, from an upwardly revised 132.6 in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 110.0 in March from the previously reported reading of 130.7 in February. The smaller-than-expected decline in confidence is likely because the cutoff date for the survey was March 19, before many states and local governments ordered residents to stay at home or shelter in place, and shuttered restaurants, bars and other social-gathering venues. 
The Conference Board said it expected further declines as the fallout from the coronavirus intensifies and viewed March's drop in confidence as being ""more in line with a severe contraction, rather than a temporary shock.""
""The consumer confidence index is likely to continue to fall as the hit to the economy is going to be even harder than it was in the Great Recession over a decade ago,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""We are starting to lose confidence ourselves that the economy can be restarted as easily as government officials are saying as the expected length of the coronavirus shutdown grows ever longer.""
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as the worst first quarter for the S&P 500 since 1938 ended.
GRIM NEWS FROM TEXAS
Other data on Tuesday showed manufacturing activity in the Midwest contracted further in March. The Chicago Purchasing Management Index, also known as the Chicago Business Barometer, dropped to a reading of 47.8 this month from 49.0 in February.
The index is jointly developed by MNI Indicators and ISM-Chicago. A reading below 50 means the Midwest manufacturing sector is contracting.
News from Texas was very grim, likely reflecting the slump in crude oil prices because of the coronavirus and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The Dallas Fed said its general business activity index fell over 85 points to a record -78.8 this month, while the company outlook index plunged 80 points to an all-time low reading of -75.3. 
The revenue index, a key measure of state service sector conditions, plummeted to a historic -67.0 this month from a reading of 14.0 in February. There were also steep declines in employment and workweek measure, which also recorded negative readings.
The deterioration in labor market sentiment was also captured in the Conference Board survey. The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to 31.0 in March from 32.6 in February. 
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. That together, with a wave of layoffs caused by the coronavirus business shutdowns, suggests the unemployment rate likely increased this month from 3.5% in February.
Labor market strength was the economy's main pillar of support, through steady wage growth and consumer spending. 
The percentage of consumers expecting an increase in income declined to 20.7% this month from 22.7% in February and the proportion anticipating a drop rose to 8.8% from 6.1%. 
A third report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index increased 3.1% from a year ago in January after rising 2.8% in December. 
House price inflation could ease as economic disruptions slow demand for homes. In addition, builders have been ramping up construction, helping to bridge an inventory gap that has kept house prices elevated.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased in February to the highest level since June 2007, government data showed this month. Completions of single-family housing last month were the highest since December 2007, and the inventory of homes under construction rose to levels last seen in December 2006.

""The world is a very different place than it was in January, but today's Case Shiller release is sure to offer some fond memories of the not-so-distant past, and some hope that the industry can continue the growing momentum it was riding to begin the year once this crisis passes,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow.

The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index decreased to a reading of 120.0 this month from an upwardly revised 132.6 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 110.0 in March from the previously reported reading of 130.7 in February.

1019,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",U.S. unemployment offices sitting on mountain of pending claims,"By Lucia Mutikani and Heather Timmons
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Last week's record-setting U.S. jobless claims number will be quickly surpassed, economists and state officials predict, as local labor offices digest a pile of pending applications, and the new stimulus bill extends benefits to the self-employed. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, initial claims for state unemployment benefits probably climbed to a seasonally adjusted 3.5 million for the week ended March 28. Estimates in the survey were as high as 5.25 million. 
That would be an increase of between 220,000 and 1.97 million from the prior week's 3.28 million, reflecting both the newly unemployed as well as states catching up on previously filed applications that had not yet been captured in the system due to overwhelming demand. More states enforced ""stay at home"" policies last week.
A historic $2.2 trillion package, or Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed by President Donald Trump last Friday is making it easier for workers to seek unemployment benefits. It raised payments for the unemployed by up to $600 per week per worker, and laid-off workers would get those payments for up to four months.
The Labor Department's easing of filing restrictions is also believed to be contributing to the surge in claims. It has given states flexibility to amend their laws, allowing them to provide benefits to workers temporarily unemployed because of the coronavirus or who need to care for a sick family member.
""These changes will allow millions more to file, and the CARES Act removes still more restrictions,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Anecdotally, we have reason to believe many companies waited for the CARES Act to pass before letting workers go.""
Some economists say the new bill would encourage unemployment filings. ""Inevitably the stimulus has created some perverse incentives, potentially inflating the unemployment numbers,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""The $600 a week additional federal unemployment insurance, equivalent to $15/hour for a 40-hour week, means there could be cases where workers will prefer to accept a temporary layoff.""

PROCESSING WOES 
Some state officials say they're struggling to process a flood of applications, and to adapt computer systems to accept new types of claims allowed under the CARES Act. That's creating a backlog of claims that aren't yet showing in the official figures. 
“We will finish the week out through tonight, midnight, with 75,000 applications submitted,” Cher Haavind, spokeswoman for the Colorado Labor Department, said in a phone interview on Friday. 
By comparison, Colorado reported less than 20,000 jobless claims to the Department of Labor last week. “Both the unofficial applications submitted and the official U.S. DOL claims will go up,” in coming weeks, Haavind predicted. 
In Minnesota, officials are asking people to stagger their unemployment insurance filings to limit the strain on their processing systems, with those whose Social Security numbers end in 0, 1 or 2 to file on Monday, 3, 4 or 5 on Tuesday, and those whose numbers end in 6, 7, 8 or 9 to file on Wednesday. Thursday and Friday are reserved for people who missed their designated day. 
""Many states reported severe backlogs. Their systems were simply not designed to process the sheer volume of claims they faced,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
U.S. unemployment benefits processing is built around a decades-old mainframe computer system, which each state has modified in different ways, making the changes described in the bill difficult to quickly adopt nationwide.

The unemployment office is one place that is hiring. Colorado has about 200 of its 500 labor department employees working on processing claims now, Haavind said, and is hiring another 90 temporary workers.

1020,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",France's annual inflation falls in March to lowest since 2016,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's annual inflation fell more than expected in March to hit its lowest level since late 2016 as a government-imposed lockdown sharply restricted economic activity, data from the INSEE official statistics agency showed on Tuesday.
Consumer prices were unchanged in March for the second month in a row, giving an annual rate for the month of only 0.7%, according to a preliminary reading of European Union-harmonized data from INSEE.
That rate, down from 1.6% in February, fell short of the 1.1% expected on average in a Reuters poll of economists and was the lowest since November 2016.
The drop was driven by a plunge in energy prices and to a lesser extent lower prices for manufactured goods, INSEE said.
INSEE estimated last week that the economy was operating at two thirds of its normal level, which was likely to knock three percentage points off growth for each month in lockdown.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>","China factory activity unexpectedly expands, but economy cannot shake off virus shock","BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China unexpectedly expanded in March from a collapse the month before, but analysts caution that a durable near-term recovery is far from assured as the global coronavirus crisis knocks foreign demand and threatens a steep economic slump.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52 in March from a plunge to a record low of 35.7 in February, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Tuesday, above the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the March PMI to come in at 45.0. 
The NBS attributed the surprise rebound in PMI to its record low base in February and cautioned that the readings do not signal a stabilization in economic activity.
That view was echoed by many analysts, who warn of a further period of struggle for China's businesses and the broader economy due to the rapid spread of the virus across the world, the unprecedented lockdowns in several countries and the almost near certainty of a global recession. 
""This does not mean that output is now back to its pre-virus trend. Instead, it simply suggests that economic activity improved modestly relative to February's dismal showing, but remains well below pre-virus levels,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients. 
The pandemic's sweeping impact on production was underlined in two of Asia's main export engines, Japan and South Korea. In Japan, industrial out rose at a slower pace in February and factories expect a plunge this month, while production in South Korea contracted the most in 11 years.
Economists are already forecasting a steep contraction in China's first quarter gross domestic product, with some expecting a year-year slump of 9% or more - the first such contraction in three decades.
Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust, said given weak export orders, rising stockpile and soft prices, the underlying issue facing Chinese manufacturers has shifted to a lack of market demand, from production shutdowns forced by Chinese authorities.
The survey's sub-index of manufacturing production picked up to 54.1 in March from February's 27.8, but new export orders received by Chinese manufacturers were still mired in contraction, after ticking up to 46.4 from 28.7 in February. 
Manufacturers are still facing big operational pressures, the survey showed, with over half of the respondents reporting a lack of market demand and 42% reporting financing issues, both up from the previous month.
""The biggest problem facing China's economy in the second quarter is the slumping foreign demand,"" said Nie, adding that authorities may roll out more policies on top of the billions of dollars pumped into the financial system since February to boost domestic consumption and tide over the shrinking overseas demand. 
Markets reacted positively to the PMI survey, with Asian stock rising as investors seemed relieved by the rare good news as the pandemic showed few signs of abating.
China's yuan, however, barely budged, reflecting analysts' views that a sustainable bounce in manufacturing looked some way off despite a slowdown in China's coronavirus infections from its peak in February.
GRIM OUTLOOK
Beijing, at great costs to the economy, had imposed draconian quarantine rules and travel restrictions to curb the pandemic that has killed more than 3,000 in the country. 
While life for millions of people has started to slowly return to normal, the pace of business resumptions has been constrained by China's efforts to guard against a second wave of infections from abroad. 
The coronavirus, which originated late last year in China, has wreaked havoc along global supply chains and severely hurt foreign demand amid tight lockdowns in Europe, the United States and a number of other key economies where daily life has ground to a halt.
Already, Chinese exporters are seeing overseas orders being scrapped as the worldwide spike in coronavirus infections and deaths has forced many of the nation's trading partners to slow or suspend production. Globally the outbreak has claimed the lives of over 37,000 people with more than 770,000 infections.
China should not set an economic growth target this year given the heightened uncertainty and avoid having to resort to ""flood-like stimulus"" to meet the goal, a central bank adviser said.
The service sector, which accounts for 60% of China's GDP, also saw an expansion in activity, with the official non-manufacturing PMI rising to 52.3 from 29.6 in February, a separate NBS survey showed.
Analysts warn the outbreak could have a lingering impact despite the government loosening restrictions in recent weeks, as many people remain worried about the possibility of new infections or fretting about job security and potential cuts to wages as the economy struggles.
China's urban jobless rate hit 6.2% in February, up one percentage point from the end of 2019, with analysts estimating about 5 million jobs lost in January-February period. 
""The situation remains volatile as the trajectory of the COVID-19 virus outbreak in several key economies is still unpredictable,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.

1022,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>","UK current account gap narrows, thanks mostly to gold swings","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain narrowed its current account deficit by more than expected in the last three months of 2019, but much of the improvement was due to volatile swings in gold trade, official data showed on Tuesday.
The deficit - a long-standing concern for investors which is back in focus as the coronavirus crisis hammers financial markets - stood at 5.6 billion pounds in the fourth quarter, down from nearly 20 billion pounds in the previous three months.
At 1.0% of gross domestic product, it was Britain's smallest current account deficit since the second quarter of 2011 and was also lower than a median forecast of 7.0 billion pounds in a Reuters poll of economists.
But excluding the often large changes in non-monetary gold and other precious metals - which reflect London's status as a global financial center - the gap stood at 17.1 billion pounds, down by less than 2 billion pounds from the third quarter. 
Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney described Britain as being reliant on the ""kindness of strangers"" in order to plug its balance of payments shortfall. 
Britain is now set for a huge increase in public spending, and its borrowing, to counter the effects of a near shutdown of its economy to slow the spread of coronavirus.
In 2019 as a whole, which smoothes out the swings in precious metal trading, the overall current account deficit narrowed to 3.8% of gross domestic product from 3.9% in 2018, the Office for National Statistics said.
It confirmed Britain's GDP flat-lined in the fourth quarter, unchanged from a previous estimate.
The household savings ratio rose to 6.2% from 5.0% in the third quarter, suggesting caution on the part of consumers in a period which included a national election. 

Economists are forecasting a steep contraction in economic growth in 2020 in Britain, and in other countries around the world, as a result of the coronavirus crisis.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 10:25PM ET</span>","Japan's factory output slows, plunge seen as virus grips economy","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose in February at a slower pace than the previous month and factories expect production to plunge in March, adding to growing signs the coronavirus pandemic is taking a toll on an economy already on the cusp of recession.
While retail sales held up, job availability fell to a near three-year low in February in a sign the economy was losing momentum even before the fallout from the virus outbreak widened in March.
Analysts say the full impact of the pandemic will start to appear in data for March and beyond, which some say could show Japan on course for a deep stagnation.
""Today's data does not take into account the impact of a global wave of lockdowns that began in mid-March,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Global economic activity is shut down, so a plunge in exports and output is inevitable,"" he said. ""Japan's economy will contract more deeply in April-June than in the first three months of this year, and may not bounce back quickly.""
Factory output rose 0.4% in February, government data showed on Tuesday, exceeding a median market forecast for a 0.1% gain but slower than the 1.0% increase in January.
Automakers and machinery manufacturers suffered output declines mainly due to factory shutdowns in China, which led to delays in procuring parts, a government official told reporters.
Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to fall 5.3% in March and increase 7.5% in April, the data showed.
The forecasts may prove too optimistic as they were taken in early March, when companies had less clarity on the extent of damage from the pandemic, a government official told a briefing.
Separate data showed retail sales rose 1.7% in February from a year earlier, as weak department store sales were offset by brisk demand for food and beverages by households staying home due to the virus.
The data underscores the challenge Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces in preventing the pandemic from wiping out the benefits his ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies have brought to the economy.
Abe has pledged a huge stimulus package that would be bigger than one launched during the global financial crisis to cushion the outbreak's hit to growth.
Behind calls for big spending are growing signs of the pain felt by retailers and households.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 1.45 in February from 1.49 in January, labor ministry data showed, marking the lowest level in nearly three years.
The new virus has infected more than 700,000 people and killed about 35,000 around the world, while disrupting global trade, tourism and supply chains and prompting city lockdowns.
In Japan, a rise in domestic coronavirus cases has stoked worries of tougher social distancing restrictions, while a decision to postpone the Tokyo Olympics Games threatens to push the fragile economy into recession.
Japanese automakers like Toyota Motor have announced factory shutdowns across the globe, including at domestic plants, due to slumping demand and supply chain disruptions.
The world's third-largest economy shrank an annualized 7.1% in the three months through December due to the hit from last year's sales tax hike and the U.S.-China trade war.

Analysts expect the economy to contract again in the first quarter, meeting the technical definition of a recession.

1024,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",China’s Factory Outlook Jumps in March as Global Threat Looms,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese manufacturing activity rebounded strongly in March, signaling that the world’s second-largest economy is restarting just as it faces a growing threat from slumping external demand.
For manufacturing, the official purchasing managers’ index rose to 52.0 this month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday. That’s up from a record low of 35.7 in February and above the 50 mark which signals improving conditions. The gauge covering services and construction was at 52.3.
While the rise indicates better sentiment at Chinese factories, output remains a long way from normal. The survey asks firms to state how business was compared to last month, so the data show that Chinese companies think things have improved from the sharpest contraction since at least 2005, when the series began.
China is still expected to have an unprecedented economic contraction this quarter, something that would have been unthinkable before the viral outbreak. The outlook for the April-June period depends both on how quickly domestic demand can rebound now the virus is contained, and the strength of demand from overseas markets like the U.S. which are facing their own spikes in infections.
“The number above 50 doesn’t mean that economic activity is fully resumed,” Zhang Liqun, a researcher at China Logistics Information Center, which helps compile the data, said in a statement on its website. “We need to fully understand the unprecedented austerity and complexity, and should pay great attention to the virus shocks on production and demand.”
The Second Virus Shockwave Is Hitting China’s Factories Already
Chinese factories, which endured weeks of work suspensions in February after travel and trade stopped nationwide, are now facing canceled export orders as the pandemic hits the rest of the world.
“While manufacturing PMI rebounded rapidly in March, the survey showed companies still face relatively big operational pressures,” the NBS said in a statement, adding that more firms are reporting funding shortages and falling demand than in February. “The global virus spread will hit the world economy and trade seriously and bring new, severe challenges to the Chinese economy.”
A sub-index of new export orders rose to 46.4 in March, up from 28.7. A manufacturing employment indicator stood at 50.9, compared with 31.8 in February.
Bloomberg Economics estimated that the back-to-work rate for the economy was around 90% at the end of last week, noting that “tertiary sectors and smaller companies are making further progress in getting back to business.”

The manufacturing PMI came in at 52.0, defying expectations of a contraction as global economic growth is hit by the coronavirus outbreak. That compared with the record low of 35.7 in February. 
Analysts previously expected the PMI to come in at 45 for the month of March, according to data compiled by Investing.com.   
Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI rose to 52.3 from last month’s 29.6.

The business confidence index from Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank hit its joint lowest level since the depths of the global financial crisis 11 years ago in the week that started on March 9, touching -3%.
During that week, the Bank of England cut interest rates and finance minister Rishi Sunak said he would ramp up public spending. Both measures proved to be just the prelude to further emergency stimulus moves by the BoE and the government.
Over the first two weeks of March combined, confidence amongst companies sank by 17 points to 6% and hiring intentions fell 12 points to 4%, Lloyds said. 
More than 70% of businesses said they were or would be affected by coronavirus.
Separately on Tuesday, market research firm GfK said its index of consumer confidence -- which was also conducted in the first half of March -- slipped to -7 from -9 in February, which had been its strongest level since August 2018.
""While we have a long way to drop before we match the devastating numbers seen in July 2008 when the Overall Index Score crashed to -39 points, lockdown Britain can only expect further deterioration,"" Joe Staton, GfK's client strategy director, said.

Pending home contracts generally are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
But Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, noted that the data did not capture the significant fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which is likely to derail the housing market as layoffs surge and the economy falters.

""Almost three quarters expect that Britain's economy will be in depression (19%) or recession (52%) within a year,"" YouGov said in a news release.
Twenty-eight percent of respondents said the economy would be growing in a year's time and 1% said it would be booming, according to the poll which was based on responses between March 1 and 18, before the government toughened its shutdown measures last week to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Economists have predicted a severe hit to the economy in the coming months and say the chance of a recovery later in 2020 depends on the duration of the pandemic and the shutdown.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak has sought to slow an expected jump in unemployment with a string of emergency measures including a pledge for the British state to pay 80% of the wages of workers who are temporarily laid off but remain on companies' books.
The Bank of England has cut interest rates to a record low 0.1%, ramped up its bond-buying program and is seeking to ensure firms can borrow money to see them through the crisis.
YouGov said its monthly measure of how households feel about their finances showed its biggest ever monthly drop and consumer confidence fell by most since immediately after the Brexit referendum in 2016. 
A separate survey published on Monday also showed a fall in consumer confidence in Britain in March although by less than in some other countries where governments were quicker to order lockdowns.
The European Commission said its monthly survey showed consumer confidence in Britain fell by 3.5 points to 92.0, compared with a fall of nearly nine points across the euro zone.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the almost seven-year low touched by Italy's economic sentiment index -- a broader measure of confidence, which includes businesses -- was probably a better guide to sentiment in Britain now.

""Accordingly, we feel under no pressure to alter our forecast that GDP is on course for a 1.5% quarter-on-quarter drop in Q1, followed by a huge decline of about 13% in Q2,"" he wrote in a note to clients.

Economic sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to 94.5 points in March from 103.4 in February, sharply breaking an upward trend in place from November, European Commission survey data showed on Monday.
The decline was the steepest monthly drop since records began in 1985. The overall figure, the lowest since September 2013, was slightly above the average 93.0 average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
However, the Commission said that its data might be less accurate and comparable than usual because its fieldwork effectively stalled due to containment measures designed to stem the spread of the virus.
Survey responses were collected between Feb 26 and March 23, but in practice the vast majority were from before national measures were enacted, such as the closure of schools, non-food shops, restaurants, cafes and sports facilities.
For Germany and Italy, between 71 and 85% of responses were collected before significant containment measures. For France, it was more than 95%.
Dramatic falls in expectations concerning future production and demand and the general economic situation were behind the record slump. Future employment expectations also worsened.
Selling prices expectations fell markedly in all business sectors, led by services and retail, although consumer price expectations increased.
Among the larger euro area economies, sentiment fell sharpest in Italy, the European country worst hit by the health crisis, and in Germany, the zone's largest economy.
In Britain, which has now left the EU, the decline was less marked, by just 3.5 points to 92.0.
The average levels for all figures since 2000 is 100.

Analysts have warned that any recovery would be shallow as the coronavirus has rapidly spread to many countries, leaving the global economy vulnerable to a deep recession.
China's official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is forecast to rise to 45 in March, from a record low of 35.7 a month earlier, according to the median forecast of 18 economists polled by Reuters.
Despite the partial improvement, the reading is still below the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction, with the pace of contraction equaling that during the depth of the global financial crisis. 
Beijing, at great costs to the economy, had imposed draconian quarantine rules and travel restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus that has killed more than 3,000 in the country. But as locally transmitted infections dwindle, most businesses have reopened and life for millions of people has started to slowly return to normal. 
Yet, the pace of business resumptions has been constrained by Beijing efforts to guard against a second wave of infections from abroad. Production levels at China's small and medium-sized companies, a major employment sector, were at 76% by Saturday, with the rate of workers returning to their posts in the textile, auto, machinery industries varying from 70% to 90%, the vice industry minister Xin Guobin told a press conference on Monday.
""Because of the relatively slow business resumption rate and slumping external demand, we expect deeply negative growth for almost all activity data in March,"" said Nomura analysts in a note to clients on Friday, adding that they expect first-quarter gross domestic product to shrink by 9% from a year earlier.
They now predict China's second-quarter GDP growth to have stalled. 
A survey last week from U.S.-based consultancy China Beige Book showed that China's economy suffered through an ""eye-popping"" first quarter as a coronavirus epidemic hammered business activity even as firms were supposed to be going back to work.
EXPORT ORDERS DRY UP
Early in the outbreak, factory suspensions forced by Beijing to curb the spread of the virus had squeezed labor supplies and sent exporters scrambling to fulfill orders. Now, the reverse is happening - overseas orders are being scrapped as the pandemic ravages the economies of China's trading partners and some factories have started to let people go.
China's foreign trade could further worsen from January-February period, the vice industry minister Xin Guobin told a press conference on Monday, warning that the pandemic is set to cause a shock to the country's supply chains and exports. 
The country's overseas shipments fell 17.2% in January-February from the same period a year earlier, marking the steepest fall since February 2019.
Profits at China's industrial firms slumped in the first two months of the year to their lowest in at least a decade, official data showed on Friday, with the mining, manufacturing and power sectors all seeing sharp falls.
Faced with uncertain economic prospects, the ruling Communist Party's Politburo said on Friday it would step up macroeconomic policy adjustments and pursue more proactive fiscal policy to revive activity. Beijing is implementing $344 billion of mainly fiscal measures.
The People's Bank of China unexpectedly cut the rate on reverse repurchase agreements by 20 basis points on Monday, the largest in nearly five years, to shore up the economy. 
The private-sector Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) due on Wednesday - which analysts say focuses more on smaller export-driven firms - is also expected to show a similar contraction at 45.8, compared with February's sharpest contraction on record at 40.3.

The official PMI and its sister survey on the services sector will be released on Tuesday.

Surveys conducted in the first half of March showed consumer services firms, such as restaurants, bars and cinemas, were the most pessimistic, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Sunday.
A measure of their expectations for business volumes in the next three months showed a balance of -47%. 
The balance for manufacturers stood at -20% while the retail sector's sales expectations fell to -31%, it said.
""Expectations of a sharp fall in activity give some sign of what is to come,"" Alpesh Paleja, the CBI's lead economist, said.
""With strict social distancing measures still to be reflected in our data, the picture is only likely to deteriorate from here.""
On the other hand, business and professional services firms expected growth in the coming quarter.
The CBI data is compiled from surveys of manufacturing and retail sectors, which it publishes separately, and a gauge of the services sector. 

The balances represent the difference in percentage points between the share of firms answering that output is, or is likely to be, up or down.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 11:51AM ET</span>","U.S. consumer sentiment near three-and-a-half-year low, spending tepid","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to near a 3-1/2-year low in March as the coronavirus epidemic upended life for Americans, and consumer spending was sluggish in February, strengthening economists' expectations of a deep recession.
The reports on Friday followed on the heels of data on Thursday that showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rocketed to a record 3.28 million last week, eclipsing the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. 
The highly contagious virus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, is wreaking havoc on the economy, prompting the Federal Reserve to take extraordinary measures and the U.S. Congress to assemble a record $2 trillion stimulus. Economists say the economy is already in recession.
""People are struggling to understand the magnitude and duration of the economic shock from COVID-19,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Job losses are the most vivid demonstration of the new reality. As the reality sinks in, confidence is likely to fall into the mid-50s by May."" 
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to a reading of 89.1 this month, the lowest level since October 2016, from a final reading of 101.0 in February. It was the largest monthly drop in the index since October 2008, during the height of the financial crisis.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sentiment would drop to a final reading of 90.0 this month.
A measure of consumers' perceptions of current economic conditions dropped to 103.7 this month from a reading of 114.8 in February. The survey's gauge of consumer expectations tumbled to reading of 79.7 from 92.1 in February.
""Stabilizing confidence at its month's-end level will be difficult given surging unemployment and falling household incomes,"" Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Surveys of Consumers. ""The extent of additional declines in April will depend on the success in curtailing the spread of the virus and how quickly households receive funds to relieve their financial hardships.""
In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting decreases in outlays on motor vehicles and parts as well as recreational goods. Last month's increase matched the gain in January and was in line with economists' expectations. 
The United States now has the most coronavirus cases in the world, with more than 85,000. Governors in more than half of the nation's 50 states have ordered residents to stay mostly indoors, affecting over 100 million people.
Restaurants and bars have been shuttered, and airline travel severely curtailed, which economists say will greatly offset any boost to consumer spending from grocery purchases following a wave of panic buying as Americans prepared to hunker down. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending edged up 0.1% for a third straight month in February.
U.S. stocks were trading lower as investors' focus shifted from the stimulus efforts to the damaging toll the coronavirus is inflicting on the economy. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading mostly higher.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
With ""social distancing"" measures to contain the virus throwing millions out of work and severely curtailing discretionary spending, economists are predicting a moderate decline in consumer spending in the first quarter, which would give way to a sharper contraction in the second quarter.
""Social distancing measures taken in response to the fast-spreading coronavirus along with extreme financial market volatility will take a severe toll on the main engine of economic growth,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Consumer spending grew at an annualized rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter, slowing from the brisk 3.2% pace logged in the July-September period.
Labor market strength, which was driving a steady pace of wage growth, was the economy's main pillar of support. In February, personal income increased 0.6%, matching January's rise. Income was boosted by higher wages and government payments to farmers caught in the 20-month long U.S.-China trade war.
Wages advanced 0.5% last month. Income, excluding government subsidies, will be closely watched for clues on the magnitude of the anticipated economic downturn.
Income is one of the four monthly indicators tracked by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the prestigious private research institute that is regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions. The NBER does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. 
Instead, it looks for a decline in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
""The current crisis means change is afoot,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""A record-shattering increase in jobless claims suggests that transfer payments will likely be the only facet of income rising in the months ahead."" 
With income growth outpacing spending, savings increased to $1.38 trillion in February, the highest in a year, from $1.32 trillion in January. 
Inflation remained moderate in February. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2% for a third straight month in February. That lifted the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.8% in February, the biggest gain since August, from 1.7% in January.

The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It missed the central bank's 2% target in 2019.

1035,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",Consumer Sentiment in U.S. Slumps by Most Since October 2008,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer sentiment plummeted in March by the most since October 2008 as mounting Covid-19 cases nationwide and business closures elevated concerns about the economy.
The University of Michigan’s final sentiment index for the month slumped 11.9 points to a three-year low of 89.1, data Friday showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a decline to 90 after a preliminary March reading of 95.9.
Ratings for current conditions also decreased by the most since 2008, and a measure of the economic outlook dropped to the lowest level in more than three years. Stocks fell and Treasuries advanced as investors assessed the pandemic’s impact on the economy.
“The outlook for the national economy for the year ahead changed dramatically in March, with the majority now expecting bad times financially in the entire country,” Richard Curtin, director of the Michigan sentiment survey, said in a statement. “Perhaps the most important takeaway is that the largest proportion of consumers in nearly 10 years anticipated that the national unemployment rate will increase in the year ahead.”
The report provides one of the more-sobering pictures yet of how the widespread economic halt, amid efforts to help contain the virus, is impacting consumers’ attitudes. The March figures represent a drastic departure from just a month earlier, when a strong job market and cheap fuel contributed to the second-highest sentiment reading since 2004.
The university’s final survey for the month included responses through March 24, a stretch that includes significant upheaval and uncertainty in day-to-day living and the labor market, as well as in financial markets. A report yesterday showed initial claims for unemployment benefits soared to a record 3.28 million last week.
“Stabilizing confidence at its month’s end level will be difficult given surging unemployment and falling household incomes,” Curtin said. “Mitigating the negative impacts on health and finances may curb rising pessimism, but it will not produce optimism.”
April consumer sentiment data will reflect the surge in dismissals and growing Covid-19 cases, as well as progress on Capitol Hill toward a $2 trillion economic-relief package that includes direct payments to many Americans.
Most notably, the number of confirmed cases nationwide continues to rise. There are currently more than 85,000 with the disease in the U.S., the most in the world, compared with 62 people at the end of February.
The Michigan data showed an index of buying conditions for durable goods dropped in March to the lowest level since 2014.
Year-ahead financial prospects declined across all age and income subgroups, though modestly as respondents anticipated the negative effects from the pandemic would be short-lived.
The impact of the virus on consumer sentiment are likely to become more evident as monthly reports capture the tectonic shift in economic and market conditions seen over the last month. The Conference Board will publish its March confidence reading on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s weekly index fell to a four-month low.

1036,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Cuts Rates to 0.25%, Plans Asset Purchases","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates for a third time in a matter of weeks, and announced what appears to be a large scale asset purchase program to help shield the nation’s economy from coronavirus fallout.
The Ottawa-based central bank lowered its policy rate Friday by another half a percentage point to 0.25%, adding in a statement that the unscheduled rate decision brings the rate down to its effective lower bound. The Bank of Canada also announced plans a new commercial paper purchase program as well as a minimum of C$5 billion ($3.5 billion) a week in government securities.
The move was necessitated by quickly deteriorating conditions, including a flood of new jobless claims last week, that suggest the economy is poised to produce one of the sharpest drops in economic activity in history. The energy-heavy Canadian economy is also having to contend with the crash in oil prices.
The Bank of Canada last cut rates to these levels in 2009, during the global financial crisis. A move toward large scale asset purchases would also be its first foray ever into so-called quantitative easing.
The move by the central bank is part of a wave of policy rate cuts and brings Canada’s benchmark rate closer to most other advanced industrialized economies.
The Bank of Canada has now lowered interest rates three times this month, with a cumulative easing of 1.5 percentage points. The Federal Reserve has also cut by 150 basis points this month. In addition to lowering borrowing costs, the central bank has also announced in recent days a slew of new liquidity measures to inject cash into the banking system and money markets and to ensure it can handle any market-wide stresses in the financial system.

Japan has recorded 2,113 cases of the virus and 57 deaths so far as the disease races across the world, prompting the Bank of Japan to expand stimulus while the government works to nail down a support package that sources say will total at least $137 billion.
While the stimulus likely won't prevent the world's third-largest economy from sliding into recession, analysts say it could keep businesses afloat until global demand begins to recover.
Industrial output is expected to have inched up 0.1% in February from the previous month, the poll of 15 analysts showed, after a revised 1.0% gain in January.
""Domestic production activities probably didn't go as planned due to supply chain disruptions triggered by the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""We expect factory output will fall 5% in March from the previous month and 2.0% in April on worries that declines in global demand will last longer due to the virus impact.""
Next week's data also include retail sales, which are expected to fall 1.2% fall in February from a year earlier, following a 0.4% slip in January.
""Retail sales for March will likely drop further not only in the service industry but also consumptions on other goods as the government called for people to refrain from going out to prevent the spread of the coronavirus,"" said Kenta Maruyama, economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting.
The trade ministry will publish both factory output and retail sales at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Tuesday, March 31 (2350 GMT Monday).
Analysts also expected the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 2.4% in February while the jobs-to-applicants ratio would dip to 1.47, slightly down from 1.49 in January.
The sharp slump in domestic and export demand has raised fears that the jobless rate could rise, analysts said.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 12:05AM ET</span>",China's industrial firms post steepest fall in profits in a decade,"By Gabriel Crossley and Roxanne Liu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms slumped in the first two months of the year to their lowest in at least a decade, with the mining, manufacturing and power sectors all seeing sharp falls, as a virus epidemic battered China's economy.
Profits earned by Chinese industrial firms in the first two months dropped 38.3% from a year earlier to 410.7 billion yuan ($58.15 billion), worsening from a 6.3% fall seen in December last year, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed. It marked the steepest decline in data going back to 2010.
The reading combines the results for January and February to exclude distortions caused by the week-long Lunar New Year.
The outbreak escalated just as many businesses were closing for the long holiday break in late January, and widespread restrictions on transportation and personal travel, as well as mass quarantine, delayed their reopening for weeks.
The decline in profits points to lingering trouble for the manufacturing sector, which is wrestling with fallout from the health crisis that has severely hurt output. Most analysts now expect a contraction in gross domestic product in the first quarter.
Industrial production and sales fell sharply amid epidemic control efforts, while the costs of labor and depreciation continued to put pressure on companies, a statistics bureau official said in a statement published alongside the data. 
Profits for the automobiles, electrical equipment, chemicals and electronics industries saw some of the steepest declines, with those for the latter falling 87%. 
Only four of the 41 industries surveyed saw profit increases: tobacco products, non-ferrous metals, oil and gas exploitation, and processing of non-staple agricultural goods.
The weakness in profits was in line with broader pressures on Chinese factories.
Manufacturing output plummeted at the sharpest pace in three decades in the first two months as the virus outbreak interrupted normal production, while factory gate prices fell more than expected in February.
Industrial profits are expected to improve as the shock of the epidemic impact wanes and firms get back to work, but rising risk of a global recession will hurt the recovery.
""The profit outlook will remain bleak before new stimulus to aggregate demand,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, markets economist at ANZ in Shanghai. ""The worldwide lockdowns will continue to weigh on the economy.""
Louis Kuijs, economist at Oxford Economics, expects a recovery in profits to lag that in industrial output.
""With many companies operating below capacity and facing constraints because of remaining restrictions on the movement of people, profit margins will remain under pressure.""
For the first two months, profits at state-owned industrial firms dropped 32.9% on year, while private-sector profits fell 36.6%.
Liabilities at industrial firms grew 5.3% on year at end-February, versus a 5.4% increase as of end-2019.

Citing a survey by a major Chinese recruitment website, Capital Economics said findings suggest that close to a quarter of firms had stopped paying wages by last week. A further half of firms had cut or delayed pay.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims soar to record 3.28 million,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to a record of more than 3 million last week as strict measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic brought the country to a sudden halt, unleashing a wave of layoffs that likely ended the longest employment boom in U.S. history.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday offered the clearest evidence yet of the coronavirus' devastating impact on the economy, which has forced the Federal Reserve to take extraordinary steps and the U.S. Congress to assemble a record $2 trillion stimulus package. 
Economists say the economy is already in recession. Weekly claims are the most timely labor market indicator. With nearly half the country's population under some form of a lockdown and reports of state employment websites overwhelmed, economists are bracing for further increases in jobless claims. 
""With partial lockdowns across the country leading to a sudden stop in economic activity, the U.S. economy will experience the largest economic contraction on record with the most severe surge in unemployment ever,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""We expect jobless claims will continue to climb as more economic activity shuts down.""
Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose 3.00 million to a seasonally adjusted 3.28 million in the week ending March 21, eclipsing the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982, the Labor Department said. That also dwarfed the peak of 665,000 in applications during the 2007-2009 recession, during which 8.7 million jobs were lost. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 1 million, though estimates were as high as 4 million.
The Labor Department attributed the surge to COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus. A running tally kept by Johns Hopkins University showed that at least 1,046 people in the country have died from COVID-19.
""This large increase in unemployment claims was not unexpected, and results from the recognition by Americans across the country that we have had to temporarily halt certain activities in order to defeat the coronavirus,"" U.S. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said in a statement. 
Layoffs were concentrated in the accommodation and food service, health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment and recreation, transportation and warehousing, and manufacturing industries.
Mounting job cuts and a sinking economy have prompted President Donald Trump, who is running for re-election in November, to push for businesses to reopen by Easter, which is April 12. With infections and the death toll rising, many health experts, economists and politicians have argued against such a move.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show that the economy ""may well be in recession"" but progress in controlling the spread of the coronavirus will dictate when the economy can fully reopen.
Recessions in the United States are called by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The NBER does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Instead, it looks for a drop in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months. 
The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department confirmed in another report on Thursday. The department also reported a 9.1% plunge in the goods trade deficit to $59.9 billion in February, as well as declines in wholesale and retail inventories, as the coronavirus helped to depressed imports.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with expectations rising that the record jump in unemployment benefits would spur additional fiscal relief. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
(Graphic: Unemployment benefits claims hit all-time high, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3979/3935/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
PAYROLLS SEEN DECLINING
The pandemic has prompted governors in at least 18 states to order residents to stay mostly indoors. ""Non-essential"" businesses have also been ordered closed. According to economists, a fifth of the workforce is on some form of lockdown. 
The historic fiscal stimulus package, which is now before the U.S. House of Representatives, would increase payments for the unemployed by up to $600 per week per worker, and laid-off workers would get those payments for up to four months. Regular benefits, which typically run out after six months in most states, would be extended for an additional 13 weeks.
Unadjusted claims for California and Washington state, Ohio, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas and Massachusetts increased by more than 100,000 last week. Pennsylvania reported unadjusted claims increased more than 300,000.
Last week's claims data likely will have no impact on March's employment report as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed employers for nonfarm payrolls, which was the week ended March 14. 
Still, the unprecedented surge in jobless claims likely signals a record streak of 113 months of U.S. employment growth, dating to October 2010, came to an end this month.
""Jobs will decline in March,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""There are numerous reports of laid-off workers unable to file for unemployment insurance because so many people are trying to file at the same time. Millions of job losses are likely in coming weeks.""
(Graphic: End of a historic jobs boom, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3982/3938/Pasted%20Image.jpg) 
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 101,000 to 1.80 million for the week ended March 14, the highest since April 2018. 
The so-called continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for March's unemployment rate. Continuing claims increased 110,000 between the February and March survey week, suggesting the unemployment rate will probably rise this month from the current 3.5%.

""We would be amazed if it didn't exceed 10% by May, if not April,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""The unemployment rate could remain elevated for years.""

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits surged to a record 3.28 million last week, the U.S. Labor Department said on Thursday, as widespread measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic stalled the economy, unleashing a wave of layoffs.
The increase dwarfed the prior week’s figure of 282,000.
The report also showed the number of people already receiving benefits increased to 1.803 million.
The release has had a limited reaction on Wall Street, with many expecting a very large figure. At 8:35 AM ET (1235 GMT), futures for the S&P 500 traded 28 points, or 1.1%, lower, futures for the Nasdaq down 67 points, or 0.9%, while theDow futures contract fell 149 points, or 0.7%. 
The report offers the clearest picture yet of the coronavirus' devastating impact on the economy, which has prompted the Federal Reserve to implement what is essentially unlimited quantitative easing and set the U.S. Congress in motion to approve an unprecedented $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill.
""Containment efforts in response to the coronavirus resulted in a very sudden and very dramatic change over just a few days,"" said Stephen Gallagher, U.S. chief economist at Societe Generale in New York. ""Layoffs were part of that change and applicants appear to have flooded state unemployment insurance offices within a very short time-span.""
Governors in at least 18 states, accounting for nearly half the country's population, have ordered residents to stay mostly indoors. ""Non-essential"" businesses have also been ordered closed. According to economists, a fifth of the workforce is on some form of lockdown.
Last week's claims data likely will have no impact on March's employment report as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed employers for nonfarm payrolls, which was the week to March 14. Economists, however, say the rush for benefits in that survey week suggests payrolls declined this month, which would end nearly nine-and-a-half years of job growth.
""Jobs will decline in March,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""There are numerous reports of laid-off workers unable to file for unemployment insurance because so many people are trying to file at the same time.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>","UK retail sales stagnate in February, before virus hit","LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales stagnated last month in their weakest performance in nearly seven years, official data showed on Thursday, even before what shops expect to be the biggest fall in sales for over a decade due to coronavirus-imposed shutdowns.
Sales volumes were flat in February compared with the same month in 2019 after growth of 0.9% in January, the Office for National Statistics said. 
This was the first time sales have not grown since March 2013, when Britain was hit by the heaviest snowfall in 30 years, and below economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for annual growth to hold broadly steady at 0.8%.
The outlook for retailers appears bleak, especially outside the food sector which has seen a temporary surge in demand as Britons stockpiled supplies in case they are trapped at home by illness or growing restrictions on movement.
On Monday the government ordered all non-essential stores to close to the public, though supermarkets remain open and some online retail is continuing for now.
""People should brace for a eye-watering fall in retail sales in the region of 30% month-on-month in April,"" said Thomas Pugh, economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
""Retail sales may be flat in March as exceptionally strong food sales offset weakness elsewhere,"" he added.
The Confederation of British Industry reported on Wednesday that retailers expected the biggest fall in sales since April 2009 next month, according to a survey the CBI conducted before the latest shutdowns.
The ONS said that in February alone, sales dropped by 0.3% after a 1.1% jump in January, due to unusually bad weather and flooding in parts of Britain.

The Munich-based economic institute said export expectations in March fell to -19.8 from -1.1 in February, hitting the lowest level since May 2009 and marking the steepest fall since German reunification three decades ago.
""The Coronavirus pandemic is putting the brakes on world trade,"" Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""Transnational logistics will become more difficult. As an export-nation, Germany is particularly affected.""
Ifo said on Wednesday that the German economy could shrink by as much as 20% this year, a devastating forecast whose impact Chancellor Angela Merkel's government wants to cushion with a 750-billion-euro ($820 billion) stimulus package.
The survey showed that the outlook had darkened for all manufacturing sectors, particularly the automotive sector which is expecting a significant fall in exports.

Manufacturers of electrical equipment and the chemicals industry expect a moderate fall in exports, Ifo said.

The Nuremberg-based GfK institute said its survey of around 2,000 Germans showed consumer sentiment falling to 2.7 points from a revised reading of 8.3 points a month earlier.
This was the lowest reading since May 2009 and undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had expected a much less pronounced drop to 7.1 points.
""In light of the current development, we are withdrawing our consumer forecast of 1 percent growth for 2020,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said.
""Retailers, manufacturers and service providers must prepare for a recession,"" Buerkl said, adding that GfK could only give a new forecast once there is clarity how long measures to contain the spread of the virus will remain in place.
Consumers' expectations regarding their personal income as well as the overall economic development decreased sharply, the GfK survey showed. The propensity to buy also deteriorated.
""Retail as a whole is facing tough times ahead,"" Buerkl said, though the pandemic was also providing drug and grocery stores with a jump in sales of 14 percent on the month.

This growth was primarily driven by stock-piling purchases which led to an increase in sales of up to 200 percent in some categories, he added.

“We have suspended work from March 18,” Chief Statistician Pravin Srivastava said in an interview. “We will have to take stock of data that has been collected. It’s premature” to say whether inflation numbers would be released next month, he said.
India has already deferred work on a population register as well as surveys related to its once-in-a-decade census exercise. While that may hinder framing of broader economic policies based on population and demographics, the delay of high-frequency indicators such as inflation and industrial production may cloud the near-term assessment of economic trends.
Consumer price inflation eased to 6.6% in February from 7.6% in January and numbers for March are due April 13. But even if the data is released it’s unlikely to capture comprehensive trends for the entire period, including whether or not prices spiked due to panic buying of essential goods ahead of the lock down.
The Reserve Bank of India, which targets inflation in a range of 2%-6%, is due to announce its interest rate decision April 3 amid the nationwide shutdown that started Wednesday. It may have to rely on fractured data for its next policy decision in June.
Factory output data scheduled for April 9 will be released as planned as the numbers are for the month of February, Srivastava said.

1047,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 08:27PM ET</span>",U.K. House Sales Set to Plunge 60% on Coronavirus Lockdown Impact,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. house sales are set to plunge by 60% in the next three months as the coronavirus outbreak batters the economy.
The slump in the second quarter, which is usually among the most active sales periods, will be followed by a further decline in the three months through September, according to a report on Thursday from real estate portal Zoopla. The hit to prices should feed through more slowly and will depend on the extent of the economic slowdown.
“Covid-19 presents a major new challenge,” Richard Donnell, director of research and insight at Zoopla, said in an emailed statement. “The initial impact of external shocks is to reduce consumer confidence and put a brake on housing demand and the number of people moving home, which we can see in our latest figures.”
The partial lockdown of the country ordered by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has restricted people’s movements and closed all but essential businesses. That has made it nearly impossible for sellers to market homes, with potential buyers unable to view properties. And the government has warned that stricter rules could be imposed if necessary.
While the logistics of the lockdown impede deals, the economic fallout from the pandemic will dictate the impact on house prices, according to Zoopla. “The greater the economic shock and rise in unemployment, the greater the potential impact on house prices over the spring and into the summer months,” according to the report.
The U.K. economy will contract by at least 10% in the first half of the year, according to Bloomberg Economics’ estimates. Senior U.K. economist Dan Hanson said support provided by the Bank of England and the Treasury should prompt a turnaround in the second half of the year if the outbreak is contained by the summer.
The virus is already weighing on deals, with the number of homes placed under offer in the seven days through March 22 down 15% from the previous week, Zoopla data show.
Prior to the outbreak, the U.K. housing market was off to its best start in four years, with price growth of 1.6% in February, up from 1.2% a year earlier, according to Zoopla’s U.K. cities index.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders point to worsening business investment downturn,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods fell sharply in February as demand for machinery and other products slumped, suggesting a deepening contraction in business investment that analysts said signaled the economy was already in recession.
The coronavirus pandemic has further darkened the outlook for business investment as measures to contain the highly contagious virus have brought the country to a sudden stop. The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps to soften the hit on the economy. U.S. senators were set to vote on Wednesday on a record $2 trillion fiscal stimulus package.
""Business investment is the key swing factor in every recession, and right now the pendulum is swinging the wrong way with declining orders likely to drag the economy over the cliff and down into recession in March,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.8% in February after rising by a slightly downwardly revised 1.0% in January, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. 
These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have increased 1.1% in January. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders would drop 0.4% in February. There were decreases in orders for machinery, primary metals and computers and electronics products last month. But demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components increased 1.3% last month.
Shipments of core capital goods fell 0.7% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They increased 1.1% in January. 
Business investment has contracted for three straight quarters, the longest such stretch since 2009. Economists have blamed the business investment rot on the Trump administration's 20-month-old trade war with China. The weakness in business investment comes at a time when corporate profits are weakening.
""Given that profits are likely now declining, financial market conditions have tightened and the economy is contracting, business investment will take it on the chin,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Business investment in equipment will drop sharply in the second quarter.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher, with investors comforted by the huge stimulus package. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly trading higher.
ABRUPT HALT
The coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has brought the economy to a abrupt halt, with governors in at least 18 states, accounting for nearly half the country's population, ordering residents to stay mostly indoors. 
""Non-essential"" businesses have also been ordered closed, leading to massive unemployment and a rush to apply for jobless benefits. A survey by data firm IHS Markit on Tuesday showed its gauge of U.S. business activity dropped to a record low in March. Some analysts say the economy slipped into recession in March.
Recessions in the United States are called by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The NBER's business cycle dating committee does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. 
Instead, it looks for a drop in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months. Measures taken by the U.S. central bank to stem the slide include slashing interest rates to zero, promising bottomless dollar funding and implementing an array of programs to help keep companies afloat. 
Business investment is taking a hit from a collapse in crude prices, thanks to the coronavirus and an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. A survey from the Dallas Fed on Wednesday showed a significant decline in activity in the oil and gas sector in the first quarter. 
The survey's measure of capital expenditures among exploration and production firms dropped to a reading of -49.0 in the first quarter from 9.1 in the October-December period. Its measure of the expected level of capital expenditures next year plummeted to -61.9 from 0.9 in the fourth quarter, as firms also cut expectations for capital spending in 2021.
""Prior to the global COVID-19 outbreak, the combination of muted global growth, persistent trade policy uncertainty and tariffs, the strong dollar and weak corporate profitability made for a very challenging backdrop for U.S. businesses,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We now believe the additional headwind posed by the coronavirus will lead to one of the largest pullbacks in capital spending in history.""
Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, accelerated 1.2% last month after gaining 0.1% in January. They were boosted by a 4.6% rebound in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.9% decline in January.
Orders for civilian aircraft slipped 0.3% last month after soaring 356.7% in January. Motor vehicles and parts orders accelerated 1.8% in February after falling 0.5%.

But orders for transportation equipment are set to weaken. Boeing (N:BA) has temporarily closed some its plants in Washington state, one of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus, and auto makers have shuttered factories to protect their workers from COVID-19.

The Mortgage Bankers Association’s index of applications fell 29.4% in the week ended March 20, the biggest decline since early 2009. Home-purchase applications dropped by 14.6% while refinancing applications plummeted 33.8%.
The average contract rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage increased 8 basis points to a two-month high of 3.82%, despite the Federal Reserve cutting the benchmark interest rate to near zero.
The decline in applications is an early sign suggesting home sales will slow and that refinancings are coming off a spike. That follows other data indicating a precipitous dropoff in business activity this month as stores and schools shutter to prevent the spread of the virus.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 07:11AM ET</span>","UK inflation falls from six-month high, coronavirus to trigger slide","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation fell in February, before the coronavirus crisis hit the country, and economists predict a further sharp fall in the next couple of months due to the collapse in global oil prices caused by the pandemic.
Consumer price inflation fell to 1.7% in February from a six-month high of 1.8% in January, the Office for National Statistics said, in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll.
The decline reflected falls in the cost of fuel and often-volatile video game prices.
Since last month, the price of oil has halved in U.S. dollar terms to below $28 a barrel, and economists expect the downward impact of this on British inflation will comfortably outweigh a sharp fall in sterling to near a 35-year low against the dollar.
""CPI inflation looks set to decline sharply over the coming months and to fall comfortably below 1% in the summer,"" Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
Further downward pressure would come from a cap on household energy bills, a slump in demand for travel and the recent closure of non-essential shops, restaurants and recreation venues, he said.
""Prices in these sectors will remain frozen at their pre-virus levels for as long as the government's shutdown lasts.""
Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said on Tuesday the British economy would contract by about 10% in the April-June period due to the government's shutdown, which it ordered to slow the spread of coronavirus, which has so far killed 422 people in Britain.
Inflation is already well below the Bank of England's 2% target, after striking its lowest in more than three years in December at 1.3%, and there was little immediate market reaction to the data on Wednesday.
The BoE has cut interest rates to a record low of 0.1% and ramped up its bond-buying program to help cushion the hit to the economy from coronavirus.
Retail price inflation, an older, less accurate measure still used for inflation-linked government bonds and some commercial contracts, fell to 2.5% from 2.7% in January.

Producer output price inflation - a measure which can give a guide to incoming inflation pressures - slowed more than expected to 0.4% in February from 1.0% in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell in February after surging in the prior month, and could decline further because of the coronavirus pandemic which is boosting unemployment and severely disrupting economic activity.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new home sales dropped 4.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 765,000 units last month. January's sales pace was revised sharply higher to 800,000 units, which was the highest level since May 2007, from the previously reported 764,000 units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for more than 10% of housing market sales, declining 2.0% to a pace of 750,000 units in February.
""We expect new home sales to fall more sharply in March and decline nearly 10% in the second quarter,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Low mortgage rates and pent-up demand will be supportive of housing when a recovery is underway, but severe job losses and damage to household confidence may make a quick bounceback difficult.""
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis because of a small sample. Sales jumped 14.3% from a year ago. 
The coronavirus has brought much of the United States to a halt as state and local governments enforce ""social distancing"" policies aimed at containing the highly contagious virus, virtually closing all restaurants, bars, cinemas and theaters.
The government reported last week that the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits jumped 70,000, the most since 2012 to a two-and-a-half year high of 281,000 during the week ended March 14. Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when last week's data is published on Thursday.
The Federal Reserve on Monday rolled out an extraordinary new array of programs aimed at blunting the ""severe disruptions"" to the economy caused by the coronavirus outbreak, backstopping an unprecedented range of credit for households, small businesses and employers. The U.S. Congress was on Tuesday close to reaching a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus for the economy.
Last month, new home sales fell 7.3% in the Midwest and tumbled 17.2% in the West. They soared 38.9% in the Northeast and rose 1.0% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions.
The housing market has regained its footing as mortgage rates have declined after hitting a soft patch beginning in the first quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019.
Reports last week showed existing home sales hit a 13-year high in February. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased in February to the highest level since June 2007. 
Completions of single-family housing last month were the highest since December 2007, and the inventory of homes under construction rose to levels last seen in December 2006. 
That could help to ease a shortage of homes that has constrained sales. The median new house price increased 7.8% to $320,000 in February from a year ago. 
Sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. New homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for 11% of sales.

There were 319,000 new homes on the market in February, down from 322,000 in January. At February's sales pace it would take 5.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.8 months in January.

The IHS Markit composite index of purchasing managers tumbled 9.1 points to 40.5, marking the steepest drop in data back to October 2009, the group reported Tuesday. The plunge mirrors the rapid deceleration in other nations as the coronavirus tightens its grip on the global economy and financial markets.
“The survey underscores how the U.S. is likely already in a recession that will inevitably deepen further,” Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. “The March PMI is roughly indicative of GDP falling at an annualized rate approaching 5%, but the increasing number of virus-fighting lockdowns and closures mean the second quarter will likely see a far steeper rate of decline.”
The IHS Markit gauge of services slid 10.3 points to 39.1 in March. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a decline to 42.
With services comprising almost 90% of the U.S. economy, the slump in the index highlights the extent of the hit to the nation’s output as retailers, restaurants and other service providers shut down in an effort to contain the outbreak. Similar measures for Japan, Germany, the U.K., France and Australia were also at all-time lows.
The economic stoppage and social distancing is also starting to put U.S. manufacturing on its heels and threatens to become an even bigger drag in coming months.
While registering a smaller setback than the services gauge, the IHS Markit index of U.S. manufacturing dropped in March to 49.2, the weakest since August 2009. Readings below 50 indicate contraction. Factory orders shrank at the fastest pace since then as well.
As businesses close their doors and the economy grinds to a halt, millions of Americans are being dismissed and filing for unemployment insurance. The IHS Markit employment gauges for both services and manufacturing contracted in March.
“Jobs are already being slashed at a pace not witnessed since the global financial crisis in 2009 as firms either close or reduce capacity amid widespread cost-cutting,” Williamson said.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Tuesday its flash U.S. Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to a reading of 40.5 this month. That was an all-time low and followed 49.6 in February. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
The survey was conducted between March 12-23. Since last week, governors in at least 18 U.S. states accounting for nearly half the country's population have issued directives requiring residents to stay mostly indoors, except for necessary trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and doctors' offices. ""Non-essential"" businesses have also been ordered closed.
The IHS survey follows a government report last week showing the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits jumped 70,000, the most since 2012, to a two-and-a-half year high of 281,000 during the week ended March 14.
Economists are predicting claims will accelerate to a record 1.5 million or more when last week's data is published on Thursday.
The virus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, has crippled the services sector due to the stay-at-home directives in many parts of the country. Manufacturing has also taken a hit from disruptions to the supply chains and ""social distancing."" According to economists, the coronavirus disruptions tipped the economy into recession in March.
The Federal Reserve on Monday rolled out an extraordinary new array of programs aimed at softening the drag on the economy from COVID-19, backstopping an unprecedented range of credit for households, small businesses and major employers.
ECONOMY ALREADY IN RECESSION?
""The survey underscores how the U.S. is likely already in a recession that will inevitably deepen further,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
The survey's services sector flash Purchasing Managers Index dropped to an all-time low reading of 39.1 from 49.4 in February, the biggest monthly decline since October 2009 in the sector accounting for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 42.0 in March, down from February's final reading of 49.4.
Though manufacturing activity contracted this month, the size of the decline was modest. The flash manufacturing PMI dipped to a reading of 49.2 in March, a 127-month low, from 50.7 in February. A measure of new orders received by factories dropped below the 50 threshold.
Some manufacturers reported shutting down and issuing refunds where orders could not be fulfilled in time.
Overall, companies reported the first contraction of new business since data collection began, IHS Markit said.
The data firm attributed the overall drop in orders to declining demand following the coronavirus outbreak. With orders falling, companies also cut their workforce numbers at the fastest pace since December 2009 in March.

Though companies were optimistic that business activity would increase over the coming year, the degree of business confidence was by far the lowest ever in the survey's history amid concerns over the duration of the shutdowns and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, IHS Markit said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French business activity plunged to its lowest level on record in March as a nationwide coronavirus lockdown shuttered vast swathes of the euro zone's second-biggest economy, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 30.2 from 52.0 in February, far below economists' average forecast of 39.8 and even the lowest individual estimate of 36.0 in a Reuters poll.
The freefall took the index deeper below the 50-point line dividing expansions from contractions than it has ever been in its 22-year history.
The survey offers a first glance of just how badly business leaders expect the outbreak to hit their activity since the government ordered the lockdown earlier this month.
As a result, companies ranging from carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) to airline Air France KLM have had to abruptly suspend ordinary operations, halting production lines and leaving airplanes on the tarmac.
The survey showed that France's dominant service sector bore the brunt of the storm battering the economy, while manufacturing retreated less dramatically.
The service sector PMI nosedived to a record low of 29.0 from 52.5 in February, far below not only the average forecast of 42.0 in Reuters poll of economists' expectations, but also well below the lowest estimate of 32.0.
Meanwhile, in the manufacturing sector, the index fell to 42.9 from 49.8, which was not as bad as the 40.0 expected on average in Reuters' poll.
""March saw a record rate of declines for services activity, while the manufacturing sector suffered to the greatest extent since the global financial crisis,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""Taken together, these declines suggest GDP is collapsing at an annualized rate approaching double digits,"" he added.
As many companies' activity grinds to a halt, the government has tentatively estimated that the economy will contract by 1% this year with the caveat that was less of a forecast than a best guess given the unprecedented nature of the crisis.
The government launched a package of crisis measures last week worth 45 billion euros ($48.5 billion) - 2% of economic output - consisting mainly of deferred tax and payroll payments and cash for companies to put staff on leave rather than shedding them for good. 

It has also pledged to guarantee 300 billion euros in business loans from commercial banks to keep credit flowing to the broader economy.

The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said its measure of manufacturing expectations for the next three months sank to -20 from +8 in February.
The balance of order books for March also fell to -29 from -18 but that was slightly less of fall than expected in a Reuters poll of economists which had a median forecast of -35.
""With expectations for output set to fall in the coming months, it’s now more important than ever manufacturers get the support they need,"" Anna Leach, the CBI's deputy chief economist, said.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak announced sweeping measures to help companies, including support for paying wages of workers, last week.
""But all measures must be constantly assessed to ensure the UK’s manufacturing sector emerges from this crisis with the minimum possible damage,"" Leach said.

The survey of 288 manufacturers was conducted between Feb. 25 and March 14, since when the government has shut down much of Britain's economy in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.

The euro zone is sinking into the biggest economic crisis in its history as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic bring much of the business world to a standstill.
IHS Markit’s measure of private-sector activity plunged to the lowest since the index was started -- and the currency bloc was formed -- more than two decades ago.
The meltdown was across the region, according to the report published Tuesday. Services fared worse than manufacturing, particularly consumer-facing industries such as travel, tourism and restaurants. The composite reading fell to 31.4 in March from 51.6.
“Business activity across the euro zone collapsed in March to an extent far exceeding that seen even at the height of the global financial crisis,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “Business sentiment about the year ahead has plunged to the gloomiest on record, suggesting policy makers’ efforts to date have failed to brighten the darkening picture.”
The European Central Bank has scrambled to limit the damage with massive injections into the financial system, including a 750 billion-euro ($811 billion) emergency bond-buying program, and measures to direct liquidity toward struggling small and medium-sized enterprises.
Governments have started stepping up pledges of fiscal spending and loan guarantees in an attempt to shelter the economy until the worst of the pandemic has passed.
Bloomberg Economics estimates that the euro zone is on track for its biggest contraction in GDP since the currency union was founded.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy is shrinking at a record pace, faster than during the 2008-09 financial crisis, as businesses across the services sector shut up shop in face of the coronavirus, a survey showed on Tuesday.
Conducted last week before the government ordered the closure of all pubs, restaurants and other businesses open to the public late on Friday, the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index points to the economy shrinking at a quarterly rate of 1.5-2.0%.
""This decline will likely be the tip of the iceberg and dwarfed by what we will see in the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which runs the survey.
At the worst point of the 2008-09 recession, Britain's economy shrank 2.1% in a single quarter.
The flash composite PMI - which includes about 85% of firms in the full survey - sank to 37.1 from 53.0, its lowest since the survey started in January 1998 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. The services component sank to 35.7 from 53.2, also a record low.
""Any growth was confined to small pockets of the economy such as food manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and healthcare. Demand elsewhere has collapsed ... as increasing numbers of households and businesses at home and abroad close their doors.""
The manufacturing activity PMI fell by less, to 48.0 from 51.7. IHS Markit said this reflected an upward distortion, due to the positive impact on the index of lengthening delays from suppliers - usually a sign of a sharp rise in demand, but in this case caused by the coronavirus.
Looking at the manufacturing PMI's output component alone, production was falling at its fastest since July 2012, during the euro zone debt crisis.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak last week promised businesses 330 billion pounds ($380 billion) in loan guarantees and offered to pay 80% of their wage bills if they put staff on leave rather than sack them.
The PMI data showed employment was already falling at the fastest rate since July 2009. 
The Bank of England, in turn, has said it will buy a record 200 billion pounds of extra assets, mostly government debt, and cut its main interest rate to a record-low 0.1%.
Former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said the economic challenge facing Britain was tougher than during the 2008-09 financial crisis and that public borrowing was likely to rise significantly.
But he warned against viewing the coming economic downturn like a conventional recession or depression.
""In order to deal with a health crisis, the government is deliberately pressing down on economic activity ... and at some point there will be a rebound,"" he said.

1062,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 05:13AM ET</span>",German Economy Heads for Steep Recession on Coronavirus Impact,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany’s economy is heading for a steep recession as attempts to slow the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic send services sector into an unprecedented slump.
IHS Markit’s gauge of manufacturing and services activity plunged in March. It signals that GDP in the euro area’s biggest economy could drop by around 2% in the first quarter -- with worse to come.
“The escalation of measures to contain the virus outbreak mean we should be braced for the downturn to further intensify in the second quarter,” said IHS economist Phil Smith. Services in particular have deteriorated “at a rate that already far surpasses anything seen even during the depths of the global financial crisis.”
Chancellor Angela Merkel has tightened restrictions on public gatherings and ordered stores and restaurants to close. To cushion the blow, the government is abandoning its long-standing commitment to balanced budgets and will go on a borrowing binge to finance a stimulus package of more than 750 billion euros ($800 billion).
Markit’s composite purchasing managers index fell to 37.2 in March from 50.7 a month earlier, though it said the situation is far worse than the headline figure suggests because the crisis is distorting the data.
Figures for France earlier showed that country in a record economic downturn.

1063,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 24, 2020 04:37AM ET</span>",French Economic Activity Collapses on Coronavirus Containment,"(Bloomberg) -- France’s economy is in a record downturn as sweeping measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic shut down businesses and force consumers to stay home.
IHS Markit’s monthly gauge of manufacturing and services activity plummeted to the lowest since the series began in 1998, it said on Tuesday.
GDP in the euro area’s second-largest economy is “collapsing at an annualized rate approaching double digits,” according to IHS economist Eliot Kerr.
France has largely been on lockdown for more than a week, and President Emmanuel Macron has warned that the country is only at the start of its crisis. He has urged people to strike a balance between staying home and keeping the country as the government plans huge spending to cushion the blow from the outbreak.
Markit’s composite purchasing managers index fell to 30.2 in March from 51.9 a month earlier, with the services sector hit hardest. Companies cut staffing for the first time in almost three-and-a-half years.

1064,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 11:14PM ET</span>",Australia Unemployment to Soar to 11.1% by June: Westpac’s Evans,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s jobless rate is set to soar in the next three months to levels just shy of a recession-era peak in 1992 as the economy is set to contract severely, according to Bill Evans of Westpac Banking Corp.
“Economic disruptions are set to be larger as the government moves to address the enormous health challenge which the nation now faces,” the chief economist said in a research note Tuesday. “Despite releasing new forecasts only last week we are now revising those forecasts in light of the current extraordinary circumstances.” He had previously forecast a 7% peak.
Evans expects 814,000 job losses in the second quarter will lift unemployment to 11.1% and the economy will contract 3.5% in the period. Australia’s gross domestic product rose 2.2% in the final three months of 2019 from a year earlier -- the most recent data -- and the jobless rate fell to 5.1% in February.
Australia is battening down the hatches to halt the spread of the coronavirus: the government shut the border to non-nationals and ordered non-essential services like pubs and gyms closed. It has rolled out two fiscal stimulus packages and the Reserve Bank cut its cash rate to 0.25% and initiated a yield target on government bonds to lower risk free rates across the economy.
Evans said the recovery in the third quarter is set to be “slow” and sees the jobless rate remaining at 11% and GDP still shrinking 0.3%.
The turnaround will come in the final three months of 2020, he said, as shutdowns and travel restrictions are eased. Westpac forecasts a bounce back of 350,000 jobs with unemployment falling to 8.8% and GDP lifting to 1.6% in the fourth quarter.
“This is a more rapid recovery than we have seen in previous recessions but we recognize that the circumstances are quite different,” he said.
“Historically, recessions have tended to emanate from investment cycles, particularly those centered on property and building with the initial shock centered on construction,” Evans said. “As this recession will hit services much harder, the loss in jobs will be much quicker, but so too can the rebound be much faster, all dependent on how many firms remain solvent.”
Australia’s economy hasn’t recorded two consecutive quarters of contraction since the first half of 1991 as strong population growth has kept it ticking over. The unemployment rate peaked at 11.2% in December 1992 during that down cycle.
Overall, through the year, Westpac expects 2020 GDP to contract 3%.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",Virus had 'eye-popping' impact on China's economy: Beige Book,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy suffered through an ""eye-popping"" first quarter as a coronavirus epidemic hammered business activity, with deterioration even as firms were supposed to be going back to work, a private survey showed on Tuesday. 
After surveying thousands of Chinese firms, China Beige Book International (CBB) suggested that ""a 10-11% GDP contraction in the first quarter is not unreasonable.""
Indicators in the survey ""continued to deteriorate even into mid-March when most firms were re-opening and supposedly 'back to work,'"" a statement from the U.S.-based consultancy said.
Private-sector analysts are slashing their growth forecasts for China to lows not seen since the Cultural Revolution ended in 1976 as the coronavirus epidemic led to widespread travel curbs and halted production in the world's second-largest economy. The respiratory disease has killed more than 3,200 people and infected over 81,000 on the Chinese mainland.
New local infections in China have fallen sharply but China's recovery now depends on other factors, CBB said.
""A few weeks ago, a V-shaped recovery in China wasn't outlandish. With the COVID-19 virus spreading quickly, return-to-normalcy is looking more implausible by the day,"" the statement said.
""Even if China can, its partners can't - one by one, they are shutting down, for weeks or perhaps months. The China recovery story is no longer just about domestic resilience, but also factors beyond Beijing's control.""
CBB warned that global markets do not seem prepared for the full extent of China's first quarter weakness.
In addition, Beijing may be unwilling to admit through official statistics just how bad the economic impact of the virus was, the statement said. 
""Investors may therefore be severely overestimating the extent of China's recovery and hence the extent to which China can cushion a global downturn.""
Almost three quarters of executives interviewed said earnings had decreased in the first quarter, with the service sector hardest hit. Almost half of business-to-business firms reported a fall of more than 10% in sales volume in the first quarter.

Most analysts now expect China's first quarter to contract, with estimates revised after dismal activity data for the first two months of the quarter.

""The costs will probably exceed everything known from economic crises or natural disasters in Germany in recent decades,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. 

If the economy comes to a partial standstill for two months, the costs will be between 255 billion and 495 billion euros, Fuest said. With three months of partial closure, the costs would reach 354 billion to 729 billion euros, he added.

Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a 0.1% year- on-year rise in core inflation - the central bank's favored price measure.
But the downturn in prices in the services sector due to the outbreak led to a fall of 0.1% from a year earlier - the first deflationary print since January 2010. 
Singapore's headline consumer price index rose 0.3% from a year earlier, slightly below poll expectations of 0.35%.
On a month-on-month basis, headline inflation rose 0.1%, while core prices were down 0.1%.
Inflationary pressures are expected to remain subdued in the near term, Singapore's trade ministry and central bank said in a joint statement, citing sharp falls in oil prices, weak labor market conditions and the coronavirus-driven global economic slowdown.

The city-state - which has banned entry to travelers to try to limit imported virus cases which have risen sharply in recent days - said similar containment measures abroad could lead to upward price pressures on imported food.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>",South Korea's March exports rise as virus drives teleconference demand,"By Joori Roh and Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports rose 10.0% in the first 20 days of March year-on-year as lockdowns across the world to prevent the coronavirus fueled demand for teleconferencing technology and components.
Outbound shipments of semiconductors, the nation's major export, jumped 20.3% on-year, the Korea Customs Service data showed on Monday, better than a 15.4% rise seen a month earlier.
""Demand from cloud computing firms have boosted sales of server chips, while an increase in telecommuting in the United States and China has also been a main drive to huge server demand,"" a trade ministry official told Reuters.
""But exports in April and May will worsen,"" the official added, reflecting the significant fall in exporting contracts seen from February.
Chip giant Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) said last week the pandemic would hurt sales of smartphones and consumer electronics this year, although the chip market - which makes up about half of Samsung's operating profit - would see demand growth.
Average exports per working day slid 0.4% during the period when eliminating the calendar effect, slower than a 9.3% decrease in Feb. 1-20 period. There were 1.5 more working days in the first 20 days of this month compared with the same period last year.
The fast-spreading virus has triggered a shutdown in factories across the globe, disrupting manufacturing and global supply chains.
Separately, a survey of 915 exporters on Monday showed Korean firms overwhelmingly expect shipments to fall in the second quarter as lockdowns and quarantines across the world hit global demand.
The Korea International Trade Association index of the outlook for exports for the April-June period plunged to a seven-year low, as demand from trading partners declined and raw material costs soared.
A growing number of analysts expect Asia's fourth largest economy to contract this year, with S&P Global Ratings now seeing a 0.6% fall.
More than 305,000 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus across the world and more than 13,000 have died, with deaths in Italy surpassing the toll in China, where the outbreak began, according to a Reuters tally.
South Korea on Monday reported 64 new infections, the lowest since the peak on Feb. 29, and brought the national tally to 8,961.
A breakdown of the trade data also showed overseas sales of cars and smartphones rose 13.7% and 26.6%, respectively. Exports of vessels have tumbled 49.6%.
Exports to China, South Korea's largest trading partner which takes in a quarter of total overseas sales, rose 4.9% on-year in the 20-day period, while those to the United States and the European Union jumped 27.2% and 13.5%, respectively.

Last week, the Bank of Korea slashed interest rates by 50 basis points to a record-low of 0.75% and parliament approved a 11.7 trillion won ($9.15 billion) extra budget.

The National Association of Realtors said on Friday existing home sales jumped 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.77 million units last month, the highest level since February 2007. The data reflected contracts signed in January and early February, before the highly contagious virus swept through the country, severely disrupting economic activity. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would rise 0.7% to a rate of 5.50 million units in February.
Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, accelerated 7.2% on a year-on-year basis in February.
The report was released a day after data showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits surged to a 2-1/2-year high last week amid layoffs in the entertainment, leisure and hospitality, and transportation industries.
Economists are expecting a recession by the second quarter, though some believe a downturn is already underway. The housing market has regained its footing as mortgage rates have declined after hitting a soft patch beginning in the first quarter of 2018 through the second quarter of 2019.
Home sales last month rose in the Midwest, the populous South and the West, which is the most expensive region. They, however, fell in the Northeast.
There were 1.47 million previously owned homes on the market in February, down 9.8% from a year ago. The median existing house price increased 8.0% from a year ago to $270,100 in February.

At February's sales pace, it would take 3.1 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.6 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A wave of layoffs at restaurants, bars and hotels, as efforts to contain the coronavirus pandemic bring much of everyday American life to a halt, could drive new applications for U.S. unemployment benefits to a record 1.5 million or more next week, economists warned on Thursday.
New jobless claims already hit a two-and-a-half year high of 281,000 last week, jumping by 70,000 from the week before, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the biggest weekly increase since 2012 and officials laid the blame on the coronavirus, which a Reuters tally shows has infected nearly 9,500 across the country, killing at least 115.
And the worst is yet to come.
Economists said their own tracking of data from individual states suggests claims could shoot up to at least 1.5 million this week. Data for the week ending March 21 will be published next Thursday.
""State filings offices for Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut report claims filings this week are running six to 14 times higher than the same week last year,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
""A quarter of all claims filings are in two states, New York and California. Given the preliminary reports for a few states, next Thursday's unemployment claims report could show an initial claims reading north of 1.5 million.""
(GRAPHIC - Unemployment benefits claims will soon surge: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3677/3638/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
This estimate, which other economists agreed with, would far outpace the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. During the week ended March 14, unadjusted initial claims soared 14,000 in California and jumped 9,000 in Washington state, which has been hardest hit by the coronavirus. They increased 7,000 in Nevada.
""Last week's jump in claims is likely to look minor in comparison to what lies ahead,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
According to Well Fargo Securities' tracking, Ohio reported 36,645 unemployment claims were filed on Monday. This was in addition to 11,995 filed on Sunday. Ohio received only 562 applications the previous Sunday.
""Massachusetts reported 19,884 claims filed on Monday alone, more than the total received in February, while Pennsylvania reported 50,000 claims on Monday and even more than that on Tuesday,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 

""Many states reported that their employment websites crashed due to a surge in traffic, suggesting demand for unemployment benefits is even higher than the reported figures.""

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, dropped 12.4% to $109.8 billion last quarter. Data for the July-September quarter was revised to show the deficit falling to $125.4 billion, instead of $124.1 billion as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account gap shrinking to $109.0 billion in the fourth quarter.
The current account gap represented 2.0% of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter. That was the smallest share since the fourth quarter of 2013, and was down from 2.3 percent in the third quarter.
The 20-month U.S.-China trade war limited Chinese imports last quarter. At the same time, the United States became a net exporter of crude oil, dramatically reducing its dependence on foreign oil. 
Goods imports goods dropped $20.6 billion, the largest decrease since the first quarter of 2009, to $612.5 billion. There were decreases in consumer goods imports such as 
apparel, footwear and household goods. Imports of motor vehicles parts, and engines also fell.
Exports of goods decreased $2.5 billion to $409.7 billion. That largely reflected a decline in exports of soybeans. 

For all of 2019, the current account, however widened 1.5% to $498.4 billion as the small goods imports bill was offset by rise in the secondary income shortfall and shrinking services surplus. The deficit was 2.3% of GDP, down from 2.4% in 2018.

""The risk of funds imposing liquidity fees or gates has risen over the last week and will remain elevated based on our expectation that stress in money markets is likely to persist,"" Moody's said in a research report.
Moody's also said heavy withdrawals from U.S. prime money-market funds is putting downward pressure on their net asset values.
Moody's said its global money market funds outlook has been revised to negative from stable, owing to unprecedented market volatility and economic uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Over the last few days, the U.S. prime institutional money market fund segment has lost more than 10% of total portfolio assets. This sharp rise in daily outflow rates has reduced funds’ liquidity levels and placed downward pressure on funds’ net asset values, Moody's said.
Despite the pressures on fund liquidity, U.S. institutional prime money market fund duration and credit profiles remain solid, Moody's said.

Investing.com - The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits rose more than expected to 281,000 in the latest week from a revised 211,000 the previous week, the U.S. Labor Department said on Thursday, indicating that the coronavirus pandemic is starting to disrupt the U.S. labor market.
According to Investing.com, the consensus forecast had been for an increase to 220,000.

The Swiss National Bank is stepping up currency interventions to stem the franc's advance, choosing that measure over an interest-rate cut to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
It said the virus poses “exceptionally large challenges” and that the currency is “even more highly valued.” That change to its wording on the franc is a warning to markets that it will more aggressively push back against unwarranted appreciation.
It kept its deposit rate at -0.75% and said its exceptionally loose policy is now even more necessary. Although the Swiss financial system has “sufficient liquidity,” the SNB nevertheless reduced the negative interest rate burden for banks.
As of April 1, the exemption threshold factor will be increased to 30 from 25.
The franc weakened slightly after the SNB’s announcement, but then reversed and stood at 1.05502 per euro by 10:26 a.m. in Zurich. It’s strengthened almost 3% this year.
Investors had speculated that SNB policy makers would avoid cutting interest rates, given that they’re already at a record low. The European Central Bank also refrained from lowering rates last week, though it surprised markets with a 750 billion euro bond buying program late on Wednesday. SNB President Thomas Jordan told reporters on a conference call that fiscal policy was central to combat the crisis.The SNB isn’t only battling a weaker economic backdrop, but also a currency that’s strengthened to a five-year high.
That’s creating an additional deflationary risk amid a hit to the economy from shutdowns to try to control the spread of the virus.
President Thomas Jordan and fellow policy makers have been trying to stem the currency’s moves with interventions. The central bank spent more than 13 billion francs on that last year, and data suggest it’s been active again recently.
With business and air travel disrupted, companies shuttered and entire countries in lockdown, the global economy could be heading for a recession. The SNB sees the Swiss economy shrinking this year, having previously forecast growth of as much as 2%.
Central banks around the world have unleashed stimulus in response to the virus outbreak, and governments are pledging to spend billions to help their economies through the upheaval.
The SNB, infamous for roiling global markets in 2015 with a surprise policy switch, is one of the few central banks not to make an emergency announcement this year. It is however, taking part in operations to make sure dollar funding is easily available to banks, a program aimed at easing funding stress from the pandemic.

The Ifo institute said preliminary results from its March survey showed its business climate index slumped to 87.7 from 96.0 in February.
""This marks the biggest drop since 1991 and brings the index to its lowest level since August 2009,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said, adding that business expectations in particular had darkened as never before.
""The German economy is speeding into recession,"" Fuest added.
The preliminary Ifo figures are based on roughly 90 percent of the usual number of responses. The institute will publish the final survey figures on March 25. The survey was conducted between March 2-18.
Separately, the DIW institute said on Thursday that the coronavirus outbreak would massively impact the German economy at least in the next two quarters and that it expected gross domestic product to shrink by 0.1% this year.
The forecast is based on an optimistic V-shaped scenario in which a sharp drop of business activity would be followed by a quick rebound later this year, the institute added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports slipped for a 15th straight month in February as U.S. and China-bound shipments declined, suggesting a cooling of business activity in the world's third-largest economy due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Imports from China fell at their fastest pace since 1986 after the virus, which has killed more than 7,000 people worldwide, led to a widespread shutdown of production in the region's largest economy.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Wednesday showed Japan's exports fell 1.0% from a year earlier in February, dragged by U.S.-bound shipments of cars and metal processing machinery to China.
It was the 15th straight month of contraction, marking the longest such run since a 23-month stretch to July 1987 when the height of the country's stock market and real estate bubble was not yet reached, Refinitiv data showed.
The fall was also smaller than a 4.3% decline expected by economists, and followed a 2.6% decrease in January.
The data offers the strongest evidence yet of the growing economic impact coronavirus crisis. Many companies complained about the closing of factories in China and declining trade with Asia's largest economy in a Reuters survey published on Wednesday.
That followed a survey the previous day that showed Japanese business confidence slumped to decade lows in march as the spreading coronavirus outbreak is dealing a heavy blow to Japan's economy.
By region, Japan's exports to China fell 0.4% year-on-year in February, dragged down by falling shipments of integrated circuit chip manufacturing parts and ground products for chemicals.
U.S.-bound exports, a key destination for Japanese cars and electronics, dropped 2.6% in February, posting a seventh straight month of declines due to falling exports of 3,000-cc cars and semiconductor production equipment.
Reflecting weak domestic demand, Japan's total imports shed 14.0%, in line with the median estimate for a 14.4% decrease, dragged down by the sharp drop in imports from China.
Imports from China slumped 47.1% from the previous year, seeing their biggest drop since August 1986, ministry officials said, as the country went into lockdown due to the spreading coronavirus epidemic.
As a result, Japan's trade balance recorded a surplus of 1.110 trillion yen ($10.34 billion), its largest since September 2007, versus the median estimate for a 917.2 billion yen surplus."
1078,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 10:34AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories slip in January,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories fell as expected in January, suggesting that any lift to gross domestic product in the first quarter from a shrinking trade deficit was likely to be offset by a slow pace of inventory accumulation.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that business inventories slipped 0.1% in January after being unchanged in December. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories would dip 0.1% in January.
Retail inventories were unchanged in January as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.1% fall in December. Motor vehicle inventories dropped 0.6% in January, rather than decreasing 0.5% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.3% as reported last month.
The pace of inventory accumulation accelerated from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of 2019, before shifting lower from the second through the fourth quarters. Some of the slowdown in inventory accumulation has been blamed on a strike at General Motors (N:GM) from September to late October.
Inventory investment sliced off almost a full percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the October-December period, matching the third quarter's pace.

While figures last week showed that Britain's overall economy showed zero growth in the three months to January, Tuesday's official data extended a run of hefty increases in employment.
The number of people in work rose by 184,000 to 32.985 million, the Office for National Statistics said, driven by record quarterly increases in full-time and female employment.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a 143,000 increase.
But the figures also showed unemployment rose by 63,000 in the three months to January, the biggest increase since late 2011.
""Today's figures show continuing record employment but also a slight rise in unemployment on the year... This is because we also see a record low rate for people neither working nor looking for work,"" ONS statistician David Freeman said.
Sentiment among businesses and households picked up after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's landslide election victory in December, although -- jobs aside -- this has yet to be reflected in hard data before the coronavirus outbreak shook major global economies like Britain.
Businesses in sectors like travel and hospitality worry that they will need to make workers redundant unless they receive more help from the government as they try to weather the collapse in demand caused by the outbreak.
Last week, the Bank of England launched emergency credit measures to prevent a wave of corporate bankruptcies, and cut its key interest rate to 0.25% from 0.75%.
A few hours later, new finance minister Rishi Sunak announced a surge in public spending and is set to announce further measures on Tuesday.
For now, the data show wages have been growing steadily. The ONS said total earnings growth, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.1% in the three months to January from 2.9% in the three months to December.
Excluding bonuses, which smooths out some volatility, pay growth slowed to 3.1% in the period to January from 3.2%.
Economists had expected total pay to grow by 3.0% and regular pay to grow by 3.2%."

The board reduced the cash rate to 0.5% “to provide additional support” to employment and the economy, the Reserve Bank said in the minutes released Tuesday in Sydney. Members also agreed on “the importance of monitoring the rapidly changing developments closely in subsequent weeks and maintaining contact to assess the implications” of the outbreak for the economy.
The central bank is due to announce further policy steps Thursday, when it is expected to cut rates again to 0.25%, the effective lower bound, opening the door to unorthodox measures. On Monday, it said it would boost liquidity and stood ready to buy government bonds to help ease stresses in funding markets.
The Australian dollar was little changed after the release and was trading at 61.40 U.S. cents at 12:35 p.m. Australian government bonds held losses, with the 10-year yield up 12 basis points to 1.03%.
The RBA’s easing two weeks ago heralded a global policy push to support markets and economies reeling from the spread of the coronavirus. Just hours after Australia lowered its cash rate, the Federal Reserve cut half a percentage point and then moved by another full percentage point on Sunday together with the announcement of a bond buying program.
“With the benefit of hindsight, the RBA’s 25 basis point rate cut in March now looks rather meek,” said Sally Auld, a senior strategist for interest rates at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. in Sydney.
She expects the following beyond a 25 basis-point cut from the meeting Thursday:
enhanced forward guidance, possibly tying the outlook for the cash rate to outcomes-based guidance;unconventional monetary policy in the form of yield curve control, or interest rate targets;purchases of Australian Commonwealth Government Bonds; and the possibility offlattening the inter-bank rate on excessive reserves spread (from the cash rate target less 25 basis points to a flat spread on the policy rate target). Were the RBA to announce this, then it opens up the possibility of a 50 basis point easing‘Increasingly Clear’
“It was becoming increasingly clear that COVID-19 would cause major disruption to economic activity around the world,” the bank said in the minutes. “Growth in output in China and other economies was expected to be significantly lower in the first half of the year.”
The RBA said the outbreaks beyond China and intensified efforts to contain its spread “raised the prospect of a broader and more extended disruption to the global economy.”
Latest data out of China, Australia’s top trading partner, showed an even deeper slump than analysts feared, underscoring the fallout facing the global economy. Industrial output plunged 13.5% in January and February from a year earlier, retail sales fell 20.5%, and fixed-asset investment dropped 24.5%.
Central banks from Stockholm to Tokyo have increased monetary policy support to assist economic activity as the global economy hurtles toward its first recession since 2009. New Zealand cut its benchmark rate by 75 basis points Monday and its government announced a fiscal stimulus program today of around 4% of GDP.
Australia’s government is considering additional stimulus to follow up last week’s A$17.6 billion package that together with the RBA’s moves has fiscal and monetary policy moving in concert. State governments have also announced stimulus packages.
The RBA cut three times last year, moves that helped revive property prices. It said in the minutes that members discussed the risk of a further reduction encouraging additional borrowing when there is already “a strong upswing” in housing. It discounted that risk as not “particularly high” when weighed against the current heightened uncertainty and the benefits from lower rates.
Data from the statistics bureau Tuesday showed house prices advanced 3.9% in the final three months of last year from the prior quarter and 2.5% from a year earlier.
The Australian dollar has fallen almost 13% this year as the currency takes on its traditional role as a shock absorber for the domestic economy in times of crisis.

1082,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 07:11PM ET</span>",Japan business mood plunges to decade lows on coronavirus woes: Reuters Tankan,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business confidence plunged to decade lows in March as the spreading coronavirus outbreak stoked fears of a global recession and sent stock markets tumbling, the Reuters Tankan survey showed on Tuesday.
The monthly poll suggested that the Bank of Japan's tankan quarterly survey due April 1 will show a sharp deterioration in business sentiment both at manufacturers and non-manufacturers.
The global spread of the virus has hammered world trade, supply chains and tourism, dealing a heavy blow to Japan's fragile economy, which is teetering on the edge of a recession.
The souring business mood could derail capital spending, one of the few bright spots in the Japanese economy. That will heap pressure on the government and the central bank to deploy more stimulus measures.
The BOJ eased monetary policy on Monday by pledging to buy riskier assets such as exchange-traded funds (ETF) at double the current pace, joining global central banks in combating the widening economic fallout from the epidemic.
All manufacturers across industries were pessimistic about business conditions, according to the Reuters poll of 501 large- and mid-sized nonfinancial companies, of which 242 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
Among service sector firms, no firms except those in real estate/construction and information/communications were optimistic.
Most of the companies expressed fears of the virus' impact on their business, on top of already weak consumer spending due to an October sales tax hike and sluggish global demand aggravated by the U.S.-China trade war.
""We cannot see how much impact the virus may have on our business in March. We fear sharp drops in sales,"" a manager at a chemicals firm wrote in the survey.
A machinery maker manager said: ""Just as the U.S.-China trade friction seems to be settled for the time being, the new virus is causing worry about downward revision to our profits.""
The sentiment index at manufacturers fell to minus 20 in March from minus 5 in the previous month, while the service-sector gauge dropped 25 points to minus 10, the Reuters Tankan poll showed. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.
The manufacturers' index hit the lowest since December 2009, the depths of the global financial crisis.
Non-manufacturers' were the most pessimistic since June 2011 in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
Manufacturers expected to be even more glum in three months' time, with the index seen falling further to minus-25 in June, while service-sector morale was seen unchanged in June.
The BOJ's December tankan showed big manufacturers' mood hit a near seven-year low in the fourth quarter as the Sino-U.S. trade war curbed external demand and the October national sales tax hike to 10% from 8% dealt a blow to consumer demand.
Japan's economy, the world's third largest, shrank at a 7.1% annualized rate in October-December, and many economists see another contraction in the current period, which would spell a technical recession - or two straight quarters of negative growth."

INSEE said that data on hand before the government stepped up precautionary measures last week had suggested the economy contracted slightly in the first quarter and was on course to decline more sharply in the second quarter. It added however those estimates were now out of date since the measures had been tightened.
""Despite the favorable economic indicators in January and February, the pre-collection of business survey responses in early March signaled a deterioration of the business climate at least of the same order as in late 2008,"" INSEE said in statement."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's central bank cut rates and the level of capital buffers it requires financial institutions to hold to 1% from 2% of their risk-weighted assets on Monday, to help companies and lenders weather the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
The authority said it could cut the buffer requirement to zero if needed. The countercyclical capital buffer is part of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and aims to build up additional capital during periods of excessive credit growth.
This capital can then be released when the credit cycle turns to absorb losses and enable the banking system to continue lending in the subsequent downturn.
The central bank's chief executive Eddie Yue told reporters the move was expected to release HK$500 billion ($64.3 billion) into the market and hoped this would support small and medium-sized firms.
He said local markets were functioning smoothly despite a large correction in stocks. The Hang Seng Index (HSI) was down 4% on the day.
""The financial system in Hong Kong is highly resilient with strong buffers. The banking system is robust and well capitalised with ample liquidity,"" Yue said.
""We expect that the financial market will remain highly volatile.""
Retailers and tourism firms are battling for survival as economic activity and visitor arrivals have come to a virtual standstill in recent weeks as the coronavirus outbeak hits an economy already struggling with its worst recession in a decade.
Earlier on Monday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority cut its base rate charged through the overnight discount window to 0.86%, after the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered a rate cut. Hong Kong's monetary policy moves in lock-step with the United States as the city's currency is pegged to the greenback at a tight range of 7.75-7.85 per dollar.
Rules stipulate that the base rate is set at either 50 basis points above the Fed's or the average of the five-day moving averages of the overnight and one-month Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR), whichever is higher.
Yue said domestic money market rates were elevated because of recent bourse listing activity.
""When this funding demand eases, we expect the Hong Kong dollar interest rate will likely follow the downward trend of the U.S. interest rate,"" Yue said.
Commercial banks were yet to follow the central bank's signal, with HSBC (HK:0005) (L:HSBA) leaving its best lending rate at 5% and   Standard Chartered   Bank (HK:2888) (L:STAN) also staying unchanged at 5.25% on Monday."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory production plunged at the sharpest pace in three decades in the first two months of the year as the fast-spreading coronavirus and strict containment severely disrupted the world's second-largest economy.
Urban investment and retail sales also fell sharply and for the first time on record, fanning views China's economy probably stalled or even shrank in the first quarter and that authorities would need to do more to resuscitate activity.
""Judging by the data, the shock to China's economic activity from the coronavirus epidemic is greater than the global financial crisis,"" said Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management. 
""These data suggest a small contraction in the first-quarter economy is a high probability event. Government policies would need to be focused on preventing large-scale bankruptcies and unemployment.""
Industrial output fell by a much larger-than-expected 13.5% in January-February from the same period a year earlier, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday.
That was the weakest reading since January 1990 when Reuters records started, and a sharp reversal of the 6.9% growth in December. The median forecast of analysts polled by Reuters was for a rise of 1.5%, though estimates varied widely.
The dire numbers also showed shocking weakness in the property sector and have prompted some analysts to further cut their forecasts on first-quarter economic performance, which were already pointing to a dramatic slowdown.
They may also mean Beijing needs to rethink its economic growth target for 2020.
China has yet to publicly issue its target, which would ordinarily be announced at the start of the annual parliament meeting. That meeting was originally scheduled for March 5 but was postponed due to the outbreak. Sources have said policymakers are debating whether to lower the planned annual growth target of around 6%, which was tentatively agreed late last year.
The Global Times on Monday quoted Wei Jianguo, vice head of the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges, a think-tank, as saying that China's 6% growth goal for 2020 remained intact.
However, many private-sector economists see that as already well beyond China's reach.
""Don't even think about it,"" said Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International.
""Even though China goes all in with stimulating policies in the property sector and infrastructure, that's still mission impossible.""
QUESTIONABLE PROGNOSIS
The NBS in a statement on Monday said the impact from the coronavirus epidemic is controllable and short-term and that authorities would strengthen pro-growth policies.
Mainland China has seen an overall drop in new coronavirus infections, but major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai continued to wrestle with cases involving infected travelers arriving from abroad, which could undermine China's virus fighting efforts.
However, analysts warn it could take months before the economy returns to normal.
""While domestic conditions should improve slowly in the coming months, the mounting global disruption from the coronavirus will hold back the pace of recovery,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist at Capital Economics.
Prior to a significant deterioration in the virus, analysts had predicted a rapid V-shaped recovery for China's economy, similar to that seen after the SARS epidemic in 2003-2004.
But the outbreak escalated just as many businesses were closing for the long Lunar New Year holidays in late January, and widespread restrictions on transportation and personal travel, as well as mass quarantine, delayed their reopening for weeks.
Factories may not be back to full output until April, some analysts estimate, and consumer confidence may take even longer to recover.
MORE SUPPORT NEEDED
The declines in industrial production, urban investment and retail sales indicators contrasted with gains in December and expectations in a Reuters poll for very modest growth.
Investment slumped 24.5% in January-February year-on-year while private sector investment dived 26.4%.
Retail sales shrank 20.5% as consumers shunned crowded places like shopping malls, restaurants and movie theaters.
China's jobless rate rose to 6.2% in February, up from 5.2% in December and hitting the highest since official records were published.
Pain was also seen in China's real estate market with property investment falling at its fastest pace on record while home prices stalled for the first time in nearly five years. Analysts expect March figures to be even worse.
Despite those numbers, NBS spokesman Mao Shengyong said short-term policies to support the property market were not among the government's broad suite of stimulus options.
Authorities have been ramping up economic support since the outbreak escalated, with most aimed at helping cash-starved companies stay afloat until conditions improve.
Other major global economies have more recently unleashed a wave of stimulus to prop up growth and ensure financial stability.
China's central bank said on Friday it would cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves (RRR), releasing another 550 billion yuan ($78.82 billion) to push down borrowing costs.
Mao from the NBS told reporters there was room for to raise budget deficit ratio this year, following recent fiscal stimulus including tax waivers, subsidies and cuts in social insurance fees.
China's central bank cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves on Friday for the second time this year. The central bank has cut several key interest rates since late January, and some analysts are expecting another reduction in its benchmark lending rate this week. 
""I'm worried about the small firms. The pressure of rent remains a problem and tax waivers don't mean much, as there's no revenues,"" said Hua Changchun, chief economist at Guotai Junan Securities.
""If Q1 GDP growth turns negative, there would be huge pressure to achieve the full year target, unless we can have a 8%-10% of GDP growth in the second quarter.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly rose in January, in a positive sign for business investment though worries remain about the economic outlook in light of the widening fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 2.9% in January from the previous month, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
The uptick followed a large revised 11.9% tumble in December and was better than a 1.6% decline predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
The outlook for the world's third-largest economy has darkened over the past month or so as the rapid spread of the coronavirus around the world has led to huge disruptions in supply chains and businesses, especially in China.
Many analysts expect the global economy will slip into recession, and financial markets have been thrown into turmoil in the past few weeks as investors fear the worst.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Saturday Japan will consider various options, including a proposal to temporarily cut the country's sales tax rate, to support an economy suffering ""quite a big blow"" from the virus outbreak.
""The slight rise in machinery orders in January suggests that business investment was recovering – albeit slowly – before the coronavirus began to dent economic activity from all angles,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""But given that orders in January predate the global panic around the spread of the coronavirus, we are focusing our attention on more timely indicators. Those point to a broad-based collapse in economic activity,"" he said.
The Bank of Japan on Monday said it would hold an emergency policy meeting from 12 p.m. (0300 GMT) to discuss monetary policy in light of recent economic and financial developments which will replace the scheduled rate review on March 18-19.
The meeting comes hours after emergency rate cuts in the United States and New Zealand to fight the epidemic's impact.
The BOJ earlier joined the central banks of the United States, the euro zone, Canada, Britain and Switzerland to offer three-month credit in U.S. dollars on a regular basis and at a rate cheaper than usual.

Make UK cut its forecast for British manufacturing output in 2020 as a whole, saying it now predicted a drop of 2.1% compared with previous forecast for a rise of 0.3%. It warned that the coronavirus outbreak could mean a further cut.
""Even before the current situation, the shocking drop in exports could not have come at a worse time ahead of potentially difficult trade talks where the clock is running down fast,"" said Seamus Nevin, chief economist at Make UK.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank slashed interest rates by 75 basis points to a record low on Monday following an emergency meeting, sinking the country's currency, as it prepared for a ""significant"" hit to the economy from the coronavirus.
The unprecedented move follows rate cuts by central banks around the world, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates to near zero on Sunday in another emergency move to help shore up the U.S. economy as the COVID-19 outbreak continues to disrupt trade, tourism and domestic production.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) cut the official cash rate (OCR) to 0.25%, and its monetary policy committee agreed unanimously to keep the OCR at this level for at least 12 months, RBNZ said in its statement.
RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr told a media conference the virus was expected to have a severe impact on New Zealand's people and economy over the coming year.
The bank was not contemplating negative interest rates at this point, and the most effective tool at this time would be large scale asset purchases, Orr said.
""Not all banks are ready for negative interest rates,"" he said, adding that banks were not asking for more liquidity.
The New Zealand dollar fell over 2% at one stage after the surprise cut, but later recovered slightly, settling at $0.5985
""The negative economic implications of the COVID-19 virus continue to rise, warranting further monetary stimulus,"" the bank said.
""Demand for New Zealand's goods and services will be constrained, as will domestic production. Spending and investment will be subdued for an extended period while the responses to the COVID-19 virus evolve,"" the statement said.
The committee also agreed that should further stimulus be required, it would prefer large-scale asset purchases of government bonds rather than cut the OCR further.
The bank however said New Zealand's financial system remains sound and major financial institutions are well capitalized and liquid.
RBNZ said it would delay the start date of increased capital requirements for banks by 12 months to July 1, 2021.
""Immediate and sizeable action was needed, and it brings the RBNZ into the line with the actions of central banks overseas,"" ANZ Bank Chief Economist Sharon Zollner said in a note.
ANZ said RBNZ was likely to move to unconventional policy as soon as was practicable.
The scheduled OCR review on March 25 has now been canceled, the bank said.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced tough new measures on Saturday to protect the country against the virus by declaring everyone entering the country must self-isolate.
There are so far eight confirmed cases of coronavirus in New Zealand.
The government plans to announce a significant business continuity plan on Tuesday with a fiscal package to provide both targeted and broad-based economic stimulus."

“A lower policy rate cannot prevent the coronavirus outbreak from having a substantial impact on the Norwegian economy, but it could dampen the downturn and mitigate the risk of more persistent effects on output and employment,” the bank said on Friday.
The krone, which had suffered a dramatic sell-off earlier in the week, rebounded after the central bank announced its support measures, gaining as much as 1.6% against the euro. But the exchange rate remains historically weak.
Policy makers in Norway are the latest to join a global wave of stimulus efforts. The Federal Reserve slashed its main rate by a half point on March 3, and was soon followed by others including the Bank of England. The European Central Bank opted not to cut its main rate, choosing instead to add liquidity, leaving markets somewhat underwhelmed.
Cutting the benchmark rate to 1% from 1.5%, Norges Bank said it “is monitoring developments closely and is prepared to make further rate cuts.” Norges Bank signaled a further reduction of 25 basis points during the third quarter in a new rate outlook that accompanied Friday’s decision.
In measures specifically targeting banks, Norway will also cut the so-called countercyclical capital buffer to 1% from 2.5%, to encourage the industry to keep lending to businesses.
Policy makers in Norway are racing to protect their oil and trade-reliant economy from the ravages of the coronavirus pandemic and a crash in crude prices. Some economists warn that a recession is coming, and investors have dumped the Norwegian krone as the panic spreads.
The number of coronavirus cases in Norway has soared to above 600, prompting school shutdowns and the closure of borders to travelers from the hardest hit countries.
“In the near term, activity in the Norwegian economy will decline considerably owing to the coronavirus outbreak,” Norges Bank said. “Unemployment is expected to rise. Economic prospects have also weakened on the back of the sharp fall in oil prices.”
The Norwegian government is set to present a stimulus package later on Friday, with measures expected to range from new layoff-rules to efforts to help the struggling airline industry.
Some of Norway’s biggest companies have been devastated by the latest developments, given the nation’s exposure to oil and trade. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA on Thursday extended its plunge so far this year to 80% after the U.S. imposed a partial travel ban targeting Europe. DNB ASA, Norway’s biggest bank and a major provider of loans to the offshore industry, has plunged by a third this year. Equinor ASA, the country’s biggest oil and gas producer, also slumped with crude prices.
As recently as the second half of last year, Norway’s central bank was raising rates to help steer the economy’s growth. The nation’s vast oil wealth, which has helped build a $1 trillion wealth fund, has generally helped Norway weather most storms, but policy makers say it remains unclear what effect the current crisis will have."

The Ottawa-based central bank lowered it’s policy rate to 0.75% and said it “stands ready” to move again if needed. Governor Stephen Poloz, in a joint press conference with Finance Minister Bill Morneau, announced a new facility to support funding markets for small- and medium-size businesses “at a time when they may have increased funding needs and credit conditions are tightening.”
“It is clear that the spread of the coronavirus is having serious consequences for Canadian families, and for Canada’s economy,” the Bank of Canada said in a statement. “In addition, lower prices for oil, even since our last scheduled rate decision on March 4, will weigh heavily on the economy, particularly in energy intensive regions.”
This marks the first emergency rate cut by the country’s central bank since the last global recession and it’s part of a global response in order to prevent the world economy from going into a recession. The growing number of coronavirus cases globally, the shock to oil prices and volatility in financial markets have prompted fears that Canada will undergo an economic contraction in the second and third quarters of 2020.
The emergency rate cut was not entirely unexpected following the Bank of Canada’s March meeting, where it lowered interest rates by half a percentage point for the first time in more than four years. Still, the response represents a dramatic move in an effort to keep the economy running amid rapidly deteriorating financial conditions.
“The Bank of Canada is taking concerted action to support the Canadian economy during this period of economic stress,” Poloz said in a statement. “The Bank’s Governing Council stands ready to do what is required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target, and we will continue to ensure that the Canadian financial system has sufficient liquidity.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment fell less than expected in early March as households responded to the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp stock market sell-off, but also hoped that any disruptions to economic activity would be temporary.
While the survey on Friday from the University of Michigan suggested consumers were not panicking over the highly contagious virus, which causes an illness called COVID-19, a more timely survey signaled Americans shared financial market dread that the coronavirus could tip the economy into recession. Wall Street tanked on Thursday, slamming the book on the longest-ever U.S. bull market.
""The modest decline in the University of Michigan consumer confidence index includes the early impact of the collapse in stock markets, but is probably already a little out-of-date given the more extreme weakness in recent days and the exponential growth in domestic COVID-19 cases,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell 5.0% to a reading of 95.9. Economists polled by Reuters had forecasting sentiment dropping to 95.0 early this month.
The University of Michigan said ""perhaps the most important factor limiting consumers' initial reactions is that the pandemic is widely regarded as a temporary event."" But it also noted that ""the data suggest that additional declines in confidence are still likely to occur as the spread of the virus continues to accelerate.""
A measure of consumers' perceptions of current economic conditions slipped to 112.5 early this month from a reading of 114.8 in February. The survey's gauge of consumer expectations dropped to a reading of 85.3 from 92.1 in February.
The University of Michigan said consumers held a more favorable view of the economic outlook over the next five years than they did in February.
In contrast, the daily Morning Consult ICS U.S. consumer confidence measure had as of Friday morning dropped 0.9 to 108.99 from Thursday, marking largest single day drop in more than two years. The Refinitiv/Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index, fell 2.8 points to a reading of 60.1 in March 2020. The survey said the coronavirus pandemic and stock market panic ""have more Americans spooked about the future of the economy.""
""Loss of confidence is exactly what we see at the start of a recession and it will be a miracle if the country can avoid one as social distancing to stop the spread of the coronavirus forces many businesses and consumers to shut down and go into hibernation for the next month,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Federal Reserve implemented a 50-basis-point emergency rate cut last week in an effort to limit the hit on the economy from the coronavirus. The disease has killed at least 41 people in the United States and sickened more than 1,800, according to data from Worldometers. Overall, more than 5,000 people have died and nearly 140,000 have been infected.
WEAK IMPORT PRICES
Financial markets have fully priced in a rate cut of as much as 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's March 17-18 policy meeting. Last Tuesday's rate reduction was the Fed's first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday he expected the economic hit from the coronavirus to be short-term, and that the Trump administration was keeping its options open for any other future steps that may be needed.

The Fed could be emboldened to go big next Wednesday as inflation pressures weaken. In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said import prices slipped 0.5% last month as the cost of petroleum products tumbled after gaining 0.1% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, decreasing 0.8% in February.
In the 12 months through February, import prices declined 1.2% after rising 0.3% in January. Economists expect import prices to drop further because of the coronavirus and an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.
""Lower oil prices weighed on U.S. import prices in February but it will be an even larger weight in March,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The drop in energy prices should prompt the Fed to be even more aggressive at its March meeting.""
The coronavirus has disrupted supply chains as China, the main source of inputs used in many factories in the United States, struggles to bring manufacturing production back to full capacity. While the resulting shortages are likely to push up prices of some goods, travel restrictions and social distancing are seen depressing demand for services such as travel, hotels, entertainment and eating out at restaurants. The coronavirus' impact is expected to start showing up in March economic data.
In February, prices for imported fuels and lubricants tumbled 7.7% after falling 0.6% in January. Petroleum prices dropped 7.6% after being unchanged in January.
The report also showed export prices dropped 1.1% in February, the largest decline since December 2015, after increasing 0.6% in January. Export prices decreased 1.3% on a year-on-year basis in February after rising 0.4% in January."
1093,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",U.S. Consumer Sentiment Falls Less Than Forecast in March,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer sentiment fell slightly less than forecast in March amid stock market declines as Americans remained somewhat optimistic in their initial response to the growing coronavirus outbreak.
The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index fell to 95.9 from 101 in February, according to data released Friday that slightly exceeded estimates in Bloomberg’s survey of economists. The gauge of current conditions fell to 112.5 and the expectations index fell to 85.3.
“The initial response to the pandemic has not generated the type of economic panic among consumers that was present in the runup to the Great Recession,” Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, said in a statement. “Nonetheless, the data suggest that additional declines in confidence are still likely to occur as the spread of the virus continues to accelerate.”
Curtin said the figures suggest Americans’ early reaction to the public health crisis reflected a perception of the pandemic “as a temporary event.”
The pullback snaps a six-month streak of gains that showed Americans had grown more upbeat as trade tensions with China eased. This month’s first major sentiment report will be followed by a final reading March 27 and the Conference Board’s gauge on March 31. Bloomberg’s Consumer Comfort Index this week posted a sixth-straight drop, the longest such stretch since 2015.
The survey conducted from Feb. 26 through late Wednesday evening captures a period that started with the virus beginning to spread across the country and culminated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging into a bear market, the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic and President Donald Trump restricting travel from Europe."

The Labor Department said on Friday import prices slipped 0.5% last month after an upwardly revised 0.1% gain in January. Import prices, which exclude tariffs, were previously reported to have been unchanged in January. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices would decrease 0.8% in February. In the 12 months through February, import prices declined 1.2% after rising 0.3% in January.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 02:01PM ET</span>","U.S. companies announced 633 job cuts from coronavirus so far -Challenger, Gray and Christmas","(Reuters) - U.S. companies have announced 633 layoffs related to the coronavirus outbreak so far, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas said on Thursday, providing the first tally of American job losses from what has mushroomed into a global pandemic.
""We are indeed seeing job cuts from companies that are grappling with Supply Shock. The Port of Los Angeles cut 145 drivers after shipments from China stalled, and a toy maker cut 18 jobs due to a work stoppage in China,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of the firm, which produces a widely followed monthly measure of layoff announcements.
The entertainment and leisure sector is the most affected so far, Challenger said, with 300 job cuts largely resulting from event cancellations. Another 70 came from the energy sector and appeared tied to the steep drop in oil prices after Saudi Arabia announced a major production increase.
Challenger's tally was the first firm evidence that the outbreak is starting to affect the U.S. job market, which came into this crisis in historically strong shape, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low of 3.5%.
Weekly government data on new claims for unemployment benefits out earlier on Thursday showed no impact from coronavirus, but Challenger and others expect layoffs to soon become more widespread.[nL1N2B4217]
""These will not be the last job cuts we see from this outbreak,"" Challenger said."
1097,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 01:58PM ET</span>","U.S. weekly jobless claims drop, but coronavirus layoffs loom","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week as employers continued to hold on to their workers, but the coronavirus pandemic is expected to lead to an increase in layoffs as companies battle supply chain disruptions and sagging demand for some goods and services.
Some businesses are already cutting jobs and demand is weakening, at least at the factory level. Other reports on Thursday showed companies announced more than 600 layoffs through March 12 tied to the outbreak, while producer prices fell by the most in five years in February as prices for energy products and services such as hotel accommodation, shipping and air travel dropped.
Financial markets are expecting the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates again at its policy meeting next week to counter the coronavirus, which investors fear is the catalyst that will derail the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.
""It's just a matter of time before the fallout from the coronavirus starts to show up in increased layoff activity,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 7, the Labor Department said. Jobless claims are the most timely labor market indicator. They have declined for two straight weeks.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 218,000 in the latest week. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,250 to 214,000 last week.
Unadjusted claims for Washington state, hardest hit by the virus, which causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19, rose modestly last week. 
The World Health Organization on Wednesday termed the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. The virus with flu-like symptoms has killed at least 38 people in the United States and sickened more than 1,300. Overall, more than 4,700 people have died from COVID-19 and over 127,000 have been infected.
The Fed last week slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, in its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis. Financial markets have fully priced in a rate reduction of as much as 75 basis points at the U.S. central bank's March 17-18 policy meeting. 
Economists are predicting the Fed will reduce its benchmark overnight interest rate to zero by year-end, given low inflation expectations, underscored by a plunge in Treasury yields.
The dollar jumped against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank announced more stimulus to fight the coronavirus but did not lower rates. Stocks on Wall Street continued to drop, with the Dow Jones Industrials index on course for its worst day since 1987 as investors took a dim view of President Donald Trump's decision to suspend travel from Europe. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
WEAK PRODUCER PRICES
The disease originated in China, the main source of inputs used in factories, as well as goods consumed in the United States. While some Chinese factories have resumed operations after Beijing extended the Lunar New Year holidays in an effort to curb the spread of the virus, they are running below capacity. The coronavirus is hurting demand for transportation, especially air travel, as well as entertainment and recreation, and leisure and hospitality services. 
Companies in the energy sector have also been affected as crude prices have tumbled, a decline that has been exacerbated by an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The United States is now a net exporter of oil and weak crude prices are likely to hurt capital expenditure and employment in the sector.
A separate report on Thursday from global placement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas showed as of the morning of March 12, employers had laid off 633 workers. Most of the job cuts were in the entertainment and leisure industry. Transportation, technology and energy sectors were not spared.
The trend could persist, with a third report from the Labor Department showing the producer price index for final demand dropped 0.6% last month, the biggest decline since January 2015, after surging 0.5% in January. In the 12 months through February, the PPI increased 1.3% after gaining 2.1% in January. 
Economists had forecast the PPI dipping 0.1% in February and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis. While the coronavirus-driven bottlenecks in the supply chain could boost prices for inputs, that is likely to be offset by weak oil prices and falling demand for services.
In February, wholesale gasoline prices plummeted 6.5% after declining 1.5% in January. Gasoline accounted for nearly one-third of the 0.9% drop in the cost of goods last month. The decline in goods was the most since September 2015 and followed a 0.1% gain in January. Wholesale food prices fell 1.6%.
The cost of services dropped 0.3% in February after rebounding 0.7% in January. 
There were decreases in the cost of airline tickets, water transportation of freight and hotel accommodation, which recorded its biggest decline since April 2009. 
But the cost of healthcare services rose 0.2% last month after rising 0.6% in January. Portfolio management fees increased 0.3% after accelerating 2.3% in January. They could, however, take a hit from an ongoing sharp sell-off on Wall Street. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index. 

""There are early signs in PPI that the coronavirus will weigh on various consumer prices significantly in coming months,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell by the most in five years in February, pulled down by declines in the costs of goods such as gasoline and services.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its producer price index for final demand dropped 0.6% last month, the biggest decline since January 2015, after surging 0.5% in January.
In the 12 months through February, the PPI increased 1.3% after gaining 2.1% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI dipping 0.1% in February and rising 1.8% on a year-on-year basis.

The report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing a surprise rise in consumer prices in February and steady increase in underlying inflation. But the signs of some inflation in the economy are likely short-lived as the coronavirus pandemic suppresses demand for services like transportation, hotel accommodation, entertainment and recreation.
In addition, fears of a global recession because of the virus and an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia have sent crude prices tumbling. This, together with weak demand for services is expected to offset price increases caused by bottlenecks in the supply chain.
The Federal Reserve tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in January. It undershot its target in 2019. February's PCE price data will be published later this month.
In February, wholesale energy prices dropped 3.6% after falling 0.7% in January. They were weighed down by a 6.5% plunge in gasoline prices, which followed a 1.5% decline in January. Gasoline accounted for nearly one-third of the drop in the cost of goods last month.
Goods prices tumbled 0.9% last month, the most since September 2015, after ticking up 0.1% in January. Wholesale food prices fell 1.6% in February after climbing 0.2% in the prior month. Core goods prices dipped 0.1% last month. They increased 0.3% in January.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended March 7, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.
Claims have now dropped for two straight weeks. Jobless claims are the most timely labor market indicator and are being closely monitored for clues on the coronavirus' impact on the economy. The virus has roiled financial markets and fanned fears of a recession, prompting the first emergency interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve since the financial crisis.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 218,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Alabama were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,250 to 214,000 last week.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Automakers in China are calling on the government to help after industry-wide sales plunged 79% in February to mark their biggest ever monthly decline, with demand pummelled by the coronavirus outbreak.
Their wish list includes cuts to the purchase tax on smaller vehicles, measures to support sales in rural markets and an easing of car emission requirements, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said.
February sales in the world's biggest auto market tumbled to 310,000 vehicles from a year earlier, falling for a 20th straight month.
""China's auto sales for February returned to levels not seen since 2005,"" said Chen Shihua, a senior association official.
For an interactive graphic on China auto sales, please click on https://tmsnrt.rs/2WcKMwa
Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-electric cars, contracted for an eighth month in a row, also hurt by a rollback in government subsidies.
CAAM said it is also calling for authorities to extend subsidies for new energy vehicles, ease restrictions on the number of consumers in big cities who purchase the eco-friendly cars and expand investment in infrastructure such as charging stations.
""The government will consider these proposals but it is unlikely they will launch so many policies,"" said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight.
""Measures like cuts to the purchase tax, support for rural markets and easing purchase restrictions on new energy vehicles are reasonable and would have an immediate impact,"" he said.
CAAM said auto sales will 'definitely' rebound in March and should return to normal in the third quarter this year.
An association official told Reuters last month that auto sales are likely to drop by more than 10% for the first half of this year. If the outbreak in China is effectively contained before April, the decline could shrink to around 5% for the whole year, he added.
HUBEI 
The association has also asked authorities to improve logistics and support the resumption of production at factories in Hubei, the province where the outbreak began and a major car manufacturing hub responsible for nearly 10% of China's output.
 Dongfeng Motor Group  Co Ltd (HK:0489) and its partners Honda Motor (T:7267),  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) have all delayed the restart of production in Hubei.
However, after authorities in Hubei's capital Wuhan lifted restrictions on Wednesday for a few key industries and allowed some people to return to work, Honda resumed limited output at a car plant in the city.
Nissan Motor (T:7201) has also said it plans to partially resume production in Xiangyang, another city in Hubei, as well as its plant in Zhengzhou, Henan.
Outside of Hubei, Tesla's (O:TSLA) production and delivery plans in Shanghai, have also been disrupted. 
A CAAM poll showed that production for China's automakers had returned on average to more than 40% of normal output levels.

A drop in auto sales this year would be the third year in a row of declines. Industry-wide auto sales fell 8.2% last year, pressured by new emission standards and trade tensions with the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly rose in February but could drop in the months ahead as the coronavirus outbreak depresses demand for some goods and services, outweighing price increases related to shortages caused by disruptions to the supply chain.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday, which also showed a steady rise in underlying inflation, did not change financial markets expectations that the Federal Reserve will aggressively cut interest rates again at its policy meeting next week as the coronavirus spreads across the United States.
The U.S. central bank implemented a 50-basis-point emergency rate cut last Tuesday as the highly contagious coronavirus fanned fears of a recession in the U.S. and global economies. Many economists are predicting the Fed will reduce its benchmark overnight interest rate to zero by year end, given low inflation expectations and a plunge in Treasury yields.
""With core inflation stable, and headline inflation set to plummet, there is little in the inflation data to distract the Fed from its immediate goal of supporting the economy during the coming coronavirus hit,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
The Labor Department said its consumer price index increased 0.1% last month, matching January's gain, as rising food and accommodation costs offset cheaper gasoline. In the 12 months through February, the CPI rose 2.3%. That followed a 2.5% jump in January, which was the biggest year-on-year gain since October 2018. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would be unchanged in February and rise 2.2% on a year-on-year basis.
The coronavirus, which causes a respiratory disease called COVID-19, has killed at least 29 people in the United States and sickened 1,050, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. Overall, more than 4,000 people have died from COVID-19 and over 121,000 have been infected.
The disease originated in China, the main source of inputs used in many factories in the United States. While some Chinese factories have resumed operations after Beijing extended the Lunar Year holidays in an effort to limit the spread of the virus, they are running below normal capacity. 
Cargo volumes at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the No. 1 gateway for ocean trade with China, dropped sharply in February in part because of the coronavirus outbreak, port operators said on Tuesday.
Supply bottlenecks are expected to lead to shortages of some goods, including prescription medication, which could boost prices. But fears of a global recession and an oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia have sent crude prices tumbling.
In addition, travel restrictions and social distancing are likely to sap demand for services such as travel, hotels, entertainment and eating out at restaurants. The coronavirus' impact is expected to start showing up in March inflation data.
""A combination of negative supply and demand shocks is problematic and will require both the Fed and fiscal policy to respond,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""We still forecast that the Fed will cut interest rates to zero soon.""
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday the Trump administration was considering a range of steps to offset the economic impact of the virus, which causes flu-like symptoms, including tax relief measures.
Stocks on Wall Street tumbled as investors grew skeptical of the stimulus plan. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rallied. 
FIRM UNDERLYING INFLATION
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.2% in February, matching the gain in January. The so-called core CPI was up by an unrounded 0.2229% last month. Underlying inflation in February was boosted by rising prices for apparel, personal care, health care, used cars and trucks, and education. Airline fares and recreation prices fell. 
In the 12 months through February, the core CPI increased 2.4%, after advancing by 2.3% for four consecutive months.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in January. It undershot its target in 2019. February's PCE price data will be published later this month. 
The central bank last week slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by half a percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. It was the Fed's first emergency rate cut since the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Financial markets have fully priced in a rate reduction of as much as 75 basis points at the March 17-18 policy meeting. 
In February, gasoline prices dropped 3.4% after falling 1.6% in January. Food prices shot up 0.4% after rising 0.2% in January. Prices for food consumed at home jumped 0.5%, the most since May 2014, after climbing 0.2% in January. 
There were increases in five of the six major grocery store food group indexes last month, with prices for dairy and other related products surging 1.1%, the most since March 2014.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.2% in February after gaining 0.3% in the prior month. Healthcare costs edged up 0.1% last month after rising 0.2% in January. The cost of doctor visits increased 0.2%, but prescription medication prices dropped 0.8%. 
There were also increases in the costs of motor vehicle insurance, household furnishings and operations, new motor vehicles, tobacco and alcoholic beverages.

""Should the oil price war intensify and COVID-19 lead to a downturn in the economy in the middle of the year, there is a good chance that inflation will be negative for a period of time this year, and perhaps for all of 2020,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.

1103,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>",Reliability of U.S. Economic Data Could Take Hit From Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus outbreak stands to wreak havoc not just on the U.S. economy, but also on the ability of statistical agencies to produce reliable figures on key data including jobs and inflation.
Americans may be reluctant to agree to an in-person interview on their employment status with a government worker. Stretched businesses might decide to skip responding to the voluntary payrolls survey. Data collectors checking consumer prices could find stores shuttered or shelves cleaned out. Economists who compile the reports may have difficulty accessing their regular computing tools from home.
These are the kinds of potential challenges in store for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, according to former top officials. Multiplied many times over, it means the disease could depress response rates and sample sizes for the budget-constrained agencies, adding more uncertainty to the figures policy makers and businesses are using to gauge the economic impact of the coronavirus.
It’s unclear how much the coronavirus will ultimately impact businesses and the economy, and its severity will determine if or to what extent the economic data are affected.
“Because the sample sizes are pretty much down to the minimum, disruption in collecting data is probably going to add a bit to the uncertainty in the data,” said Keith Hall, a former BLS commissioner who served from 2008 to 2012. For policy makers, that “makes it a little harder to see exactly what you’re dealing with.”
Amid decreasing response rates, especially with household surveys, the agencies’ tasks have become increasingly challenging and more expensive given the extra follow-up required. While costs of collecting the data have increased, budgets have largely stagnated, fallen short of requests or even declined, leading to smaller sample sizes in some cases.
BLS -- the home of widely watched reports on employment and consumer prices -- will continue operations as normal but is “keeping careful watch” on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and “will communicate any changes in operations if these restrictions begin to affect BLS collection or publishing efforts,” spokesperson Stacey Standish said in an email Monday.
Pandemic Procedures
The Census Bureau, which compiles data on retail sales, home construction and factory orders, and also conducts the decennial census, said in a statement: “Operations for the 2020 Census and our ongoing household surveys have procedures built in that specifically anticipate epidemics and pandemics, and we will continue to work with the relevant authorities to keep those up to date.”
The Commerce Department said in a statement that it has a contingency plan to ensure the BEA -- which puts out gross domestic product and consumer spending -- can continue operating during a pandemic.
The virus’s impact will depend on the report. Agencies collect data in a variety of ways -- in person, by phone, by mail from other data sources -- to measure the country’s employment, spending, prices and more.
For example, the widely-watched employment report is made up of two separate voluntary surveys.
The household survey, which feeds into statistics on unemployment and labor-force participation, is conducted by the Census Bureau through a combination of in-person and phone interviews, covering about 60,000 households each month. Over the past decade, the response rate for that survey has already dropped by almost 9 percentage points.
Voluntary Survey
The establishment survey, which informs statistics such as payrolls, wages and hours worked, relies on voluntary responses from about 145,000 businesses and government agencies.
“If companies feel strained and have people out, they can easily bail on providing the data,” Hall said. “It takes two to do the data collection.”
Another question is whether staff members of the agencies will be affected, said Erica Groshen, who was BLS commissioner from 2013 to 2017.
“The agencies wouldn’t want to be putting their staff at risk” for the disease or for spreading it, Groshen said.
Even if the data can be collected as normal, the many steps to make sure the data are accurate and prepare them for analysis are typically done in the office, said Robert Groves, who served as director of the Census Bureau from 2009 to 2012.
“This will be a stress test of the computing platforms and the computer infrastructure of those agencies,” Groves said.
Any disruptions could prove challenging for the BEA, which relies on data collected by the BLS and the Census Bureau.
Harder Job
“Their job will be made much harder by trying to put together various sources that may be a little bit less reliable in one particular quarter or come in later than they normally do because of disruptions,” Groshen said.
The virus could also impact the decennial census. Data collected in the coming months will determine the allocation of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding over the next 10 years as well as the number of seats each state has in Congress.
In 2010, about two-thirds of the country responded to the survey without an in-person follow-up. The process of following up with civilians in person may prove more challenging if the coronavirus continues to spread -- though it’s possible some Americans staying home might also be more likely to respond.
“For the first time in our lives, people may view surveys as a form of entertainment,” Groves said."

The U.K. economy failed to grow in January, adding to the case for the Bank of England’s emergency rate cut Wednesday.
The figures suggest the pickup seen after Boris Johnson’s election win proved short-lived, with momentum waning even before fears about the coronavirus took hold in February.
Gross domestic product was unchanged from December, when it grew 0.3%, the Office for National Statistics said. A rise of 0.2% had been forecast. The economy also stagnated over the latest three months.
The report comes shortly after the BOE slashed its benchmark rate by a half point and announced measures to keep credit flowing.
Policy makers warned that the outbreak will cause the economy to weaken materially. Some forecasters expect output will shrink in the second and third quarters of the year.
The government is preparing to announce its own stimulus measures in the Budget, due at 12.30 p.m. The fiscal watchdog is expected to downgrade its growth forecasts but Bloomberg Economics reckons GDP could contract this year if the virus becomes a pandemic.
Manufacturing and services posted meager growth in January, and construction activity shrank. In the latest three months, services -- the largest part of the economy -- flat-lined with the retail and telecommunication sectors both posting declines.
The economy stagnated on a three-month basis for a third period running, the longest such run since the financial crisis in 2009.
The trade deficit widened to 3.7 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) in January amid a 6% drop in exports. Recent figures have been heavily distorted by flows of non-monetary gold. Excluding precious metals, the deficit grew slightly to 7.8 billion pounds."

The flu-like epidemic, which originated in the central city of Wuhan, has killed 3,158 and infected more than 80,000 in mainland China.
Data from Japan's Komatsu (T:6301), one of the world's biggest makers of earth-moving equipment, showed use of its machinery in China fell nearly 30% to 32 hours last month, from a year ago.
That compares to 59.1 hours in January and 44.9 hours in February last year.

Millions of construction workers in China returned to their hometowns for traditional week-long Lunar New Year celebrations, which kicked off in late January.
But the government extended the holiday for an extra two weeks in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.
Property and infrastructure projects, including the second-phase of the China-Russia natural gas pipeline project, were halted until late February.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed the sharpest contraction in factory activity on record in February, down sharply to 40.3 from 51.1 in January.

Average utilisation rates at cement producers across China last week were 13.71%, up 5.13 percentage points on the week. But cement producers in northern China remained mainly shut as resumption at construction sites was still slow.
With the drop in new infections, China has been striving to bring workers back to their posts and enable firms to resume operations, by offering financial support and approving new infrastructure projects.
By Wednesday, 24 regions had lowered emergency response levels to the epidemic. The transport ministry expects all migrant workers to return to their workplaces by early April.

1106,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 12:42AM ET</span>",Virus Hits Hong Kong Business Sentiment Even Harder Than Protests,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s small business sentiment plunged to a record low in February, falling through the previous trough reached during months of violent unrest last year, as the coronavirus outbreak proves to be an even stronger headwind to consumption.
The overall current sentiment reading for the city’s small and medium-sized enterprises slumped to 20.3 in February, the lowest in recorded data, according to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department. Sentiment among retailers collapsed to 16.6, also a record. Publication of the gauges began in 2011.
The latest readings are well under the previous lows set in August at the height of anti-government street protests that drove the city into recession. While the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic has put a halt to mass demonstrations, it’s become a bigger setback for the city’s businesses. Even as Hong Kong’s new cases of infection slow, the outbreak is accelerating globally in western countries, disrupting global supply chains and threatening to wipe more than $1 trillion from aggregate global gross domestic product.
The outbreak of Covid-19, the name of the disease caused by the coronavirus, resulted in “across-the-board downturn in business activities,” according to the government report released Tuesday.
Any recovery in Hong Kong’s economy after half a year of political unrest now looks unlikely as visitor arrivals from the mainland have collapsed and locals are staying home, this time to avoid infection. The sentiment indicator had reached 44.1 in January during a three-month rally following a relative lull in the ongoing protests.
A shock plunge in the price of oil this week affected asset values around the world, pointing to an increasingly murky outlook for the global economy in the months to come.
In his budget presented at the end of February, Financial Secretary Paul Chan projected the city will see economic growth in the range of -1.5% to +0.5% in 2020, following an annual contraction last year that was the first in a decade. The budget included a HK$120 billion ($15.4 billion) relief package that gave a HK$10,000 handout to permanent residents aged 18 and older.
In an interview with Bloomberg Television in early March, Chan said he expects the cash handouts to start positively affecting the economy this summer, urging those who receive the cash to spend it at local businesses.
“I think people will of course depending on their own personal circumstances, support us and support Hong Kong,” Chan said."

Wednesday's survey showed the Melbourne Institute and Westpac Bank (AX:WBC) index of consumer sentiment fell 3.8% in March, more than reversing February's 2.3% bounce.
The index was down 7.0% from a year earlier and, at 91.9, the lowest since December 2014.
""The worsening coronavirus outbreak and associated rout in financial markets have had a major impact on sentiment this month,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.
""In fact, it is the second lowest level since the global financial crisis when the Index bottomed out at 79.""
The biggest impact was on the survey's measure of the economic outlook for the next 12 months, which dived 12.8%. Yet the outlook for the next five years eased by only 1.3%.
The measure of family finances compared with a year ago actually rose 1.8%, while the outlook for the year ahead dipped 1.7%.
""The survey detail shows consumers are rightly concerned about the near term outlook for the economy but are less perturbed about their finances or the longer term outlook for the economy,"" said Evans.
""That is consistent with the notion that virus-related disruptions will be large but temporary.""
The measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item dropped 4.3%, and remains well below its long run average."

The spread of the deadly virus known as COVID-19 shut down cities and factories in China for weeks, disrupting ocean and air shipments and roiling global supply chains. China is a vital link in the shipping sector, transporting everything from food to mobile phones and apparel to auto parts.
Total volume of cargo containers - known as 20-foot equivalent units, or TEUs - moved by terminal operators and dockworkers dropped 22.9% at the larger Port of Los Angeles, where 55% of container ""lifts"" are tied to China.
The adjacent Port of Long Beach reported a year-over-year drop of 9.8% for February.
""We are more interconnected than ever with our global partners so it's no surprise that Trans-Pacific maritime trade has been significantly impacted,"" Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said in a statement.
Total February volumes were 544,037 TEUs at the Port of Los Angeles. Imports tumbled 22.5% and exports fell 5.7% for the month.
""With the extended factory closures and slowdown of goods movement in China and other Asian countries in February due to Lunar New Year and COVID-19, we are seeing shipping lines needing to cancel some sailings,"" Mario Cordero, Port of Long Beach executive director, said.
The Port of Long Beach handled 538,428 TEUs last month. Imports slid 17.9%, while exports, which account for a much smaller share of port traffic, were up 19.3%.
Cargo ships take about two to three weeks to make the journey from China to the U.S. West Coast. U.S. shippers and port executives told Reuters that the coronavirus-related weakness could stretch into April."

Core inflation, which removes the more volatile food and energy prices, climbed 1%, the slowest rise since 2010.“The slowdown in core CPI to a 10-year low suggests demand was more affected than supply,” according to Xing Zhaopeng, an economist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “With the global spread of Covid-19, external demand is expected to fall as well, and the recent plunge in oil price reinforces not only economic uncertainty but also deflationary expectations.”It will be hard to determine the exact effect on prices of the coronavirus outbreak, which worsened dramatically over the lunar new year period in late January and early February.A drop in demand such as that caused by shutdowns to curb the virus would pull prices down, but the supply limits caused by the quarantines and shutdowns could also push some price pressures higher.Get More
The biggest contributor to consumer inflation was the cost of pork, which continued to skyrocket, up the most since 2007.Food prices rose 21.9% the most since April 2008, while pork prices, a key element in the country’s CPI basket, rose 135.2%. China’s pork output dropped more than 21% in 2019 after outbreaks of African swine fever decimated herds. That drove up the price of pork and other foods.“Looking ahead, upward pressure from food prices may weaken but remain considerable in the coming months, as the virus has interrupted the production of some foods, such as pork,” David Qu, an economist at Bloomberg Economics in Hong Kong, said before the data. “But weak demand for consumer goods should keep overall inflation in check.”(Updates with more details and comments throughout.)"
1111,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 12:17AM ET</span>","Despite Virus, China Consumer Confidence Remains Envy of World","(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus is increasingly weighing on global consumer sentiment, but its impact can vary greatly.
Take Japan. The outbreak there has been mild, but among major economies consumer confidence has taken the biggest hit, according to daily tracking surveys in 12 countries by Morning Consult, a data-intelligence provider. The main reason is that Japanese shoppers were already quite negative thanks to a sluggish economy and a recent increase in taxes on consumer goods.
By contrast, China has the highest consumer sentiment reading. At 139.4, it's more than double Japan's level in the same survey, even though China has been the disease's epicenter, with by far the most cases and the most deaths. A lack of free press and restricted internet access are part of the reason for the relative optimism because controlling information can reduce fear and panic, according to the researcher.
“When looking at China’s data, it's not just a function of the outbreak,” said John Leer, an economist at Morning Consult. “It’s also the news sources they are consuming.”
As investors try to figure out what the virus means for economies, there are a few key factors that make countries especially vulnerable to drops in consumer sentiment, Morning Consult said. For one, context matters. Japan, the U.K. and Germany were already experiencing waning confidence when the virus hit and their confidence readings are significantly lower than places like the U.S, which was near an all-time high. 
“Japan was already vulnerable,” Leer said. “The coronavirus is a one-two punch.”
How many households are invested in stocks is also crucial. And given the rout in markets, countries with a high percentage of people invested in the stock market are more likely to see shopping confidence erode. If that persists, demand for major purchases such as appliances and cars will start to sputter. That’s worrisome for the U.S., which has the highest rate with more than 50% of households invested.
All this leads Leer to believe that confidence is going to keep weakening around the world. That’s especially problematic for America because it depends on consumer spending for about 70% of its economic activity, more than any other major economy. 
“These things can turn into self-fulfilling prophecies,” Leer said. “Fear can limit economic activity, which causes firms to pull back on hiring. That can dampen income. It can turn into a vicious cycle quickly.”"

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak has reversed a recent upturn in British business leaders' optimism, with confidence now at a six-month low, a survey by the Institute of Directors showed on Monday.
The business outlook turned positive at the end of last year after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election win in December cleared some short-term uncertainty around Brexit and removed the possibility of a left-wing Labour government.
But the outbreak of the coronavirus meant business leaders' outlook on the economy turned negative in March 2020, with one in five survey respondents saying that the outbreak represents a high or severe threat to their business.
""With the prospect of orders drying up and staff in quarantine, some firms will be looking at a potential cashflow crunch, and confidence in the economy has taken a knock,"" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said.
A third of business directors said they had canceled or restricted staff travel while almost half had encouraged remote working. Most had taken steps to improved office hygiene and cleaning.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank more than initially estimated in the fourth quarter - by the most since the 2014 sales tax hike - exacerbating fears for economic prospects at a time when the impact of the coronavirus outbreak is increasing recession risk.
A spike in the yen and drop in Tokyo stocks - against a backdrop of oil price cuts that are playing havoc with financial markets - add to woes for an economy which is contending with an October sales tax hike to 10% from 8%, as well as slumping tourism and supply chain disruption caused by the health crisis.
The bleak data piles renewed pressure on the government and central bank to deploy stronger fiscal and monetary support.
""Japan's economy is already in recession and there are emerging signals that the worst has yet to come,"" said Mizuho Securities senior market economist Toru Suehiro.
""There's not much the Bank of Japan (BOJ) can do as monetary easing cannot cure the disease. The least the government and the BOJ can do is to prevent the negative psychological effects of the epidemic from spiraling further.""
The world's third-largest economy shrank an annualized 7.1% in the three months through December, revised data showed on Monday, more than a preliminary reading of 6.3% and a median market forecast of 6.6%.
The figure represents the steepest decline since April-June 2014, when a sales tax hike to 8% from 5% in April of that year pushed the economy into recession.
The deeper contraction and the virus impact have fueled fears of contraction in January-March to mark two consecutive quarters - the definition of a recession.
""Unfortunately, any recovery in Q1 has been nipped in the bud by the global spread of the coronavirus,"" said Capital Economics' Japan economist Tom Learmouth. The economy is likely to contract 0.5% in the current quarter from the last, he said.
CAPEX WEAKNESS
Analysts largely blamed slower October-December growth on weakness in capital spending - previously considered the lone bright spot in an otherwise weak economy.
Capital spending fell 4.6% from the previous quarter, worse than a preliminary 3.7% estimate and the biggest drop since 2009, in a sign of soft global demand and Sino-U.S. trade war impacting investment appetite.
Private consumption fell 2.8%, in line with the preliminary 2.9% decline, as households withheld spending after the sales tax hike.
The weakness in domestic demand threatens the central bank's argument that robust capital expenditure will offset some of the pain from soft exports.
The Bank of Japan may take steps next week to ease the financial strain of firms suffering slumping sales due to the virus outbreak, people familiar with the bank's thinking previously told Reuters.
Adding to the pain for the export-reliant economy, the Nikkei stock average fell 5% to below 20,000 and the yen spiked as investors flocked to the safety of the Japanese currency.
A senior finance ministry official told reporters on Monday of ""nervous moves"" in the currency market and that he would watch movement with a greater sense of urgency.
If the yen continues to rise, the Bank of Japan may be pressured to take bolder steps beyond financial assistance for small firms, analysts said.
""There were market rumors the BOJ could hold an emergency meeting before its scheduled interest rate review on March 18-19, to ease policy. The trigger could be the Nikkei's slide below 20,000,"" said Dai-ichi Life Research Institute economist Koichi Fujishiro.
""If that happens, the BOJ could ramp up its purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETF) to around 9 trillion to 10 trillion yen"" from the current 6 trillion yen ($58.62 billion), he said.
The government, for its part, plans to compile a second package of emergency measures to deal with the virus on Tuesday, though analysts said any spending will likely be modest in size and funded by reserves set aside for emergency purposes.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has come under fire for his handling of the crisis as the number of coronavirus cases in Japan surpassed 1,100, just as the nation prepares to host the summer Olympic Games in July and August.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2020 08:07PM ET</span>","China January-February exports tumble, imports down as coronavirus batters trade and business","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports contracted sharply in the first two months of the year, and imports declined, as the health crisis triggered by the coronavirus outbreak caused massive disruptions to business operations, global supply chains and economic activity.
The gloomy trade report is likely to reinforce fears that China's economic growth halved in the first quarter to the weakest since 1990 as the epidemic and strict government containment measures crippled factory production and led to a sharp slump in demand. 
Overseas shipments fell 17.2% in January-February from the same period a year earlier, customs data showed on Saturday, marking the steepest fall since February 2019.
That compared with a 14% drop tipped by a Reuters poll of analysts and a 7.9% gain in December. 
Imports sank 4% from a year earlier, but were better than market expectations of a 15% drop. They had jumped 16.5% in December, buoyed in part by a preliminary Sino-U.S. trade deal.
China ran a trade deficit of $7.09 billion for the period, reversing an expected $24.6 billion surplus in the poll.

Factory activity contracted at the fastest pace ever in February, even worse than during the global financial crisis, an official manufacturing gauge showed last weekend, with a sharp slump in new orders. A private survey highlighted similarly dire conditions.
The epidemic has killed over 3,000 and infected more than 80,000 in China. Though the number of new infections in China is falling, and local governments are slowly relaxing emergency measures, analysts say many businesses are taking longer to reopen than expected, and may not return to normal production till April.
Those delays threaten an even longer and costlier spillover into the economies of China's major trading partners, many of which rely heavily on Chinese-made parts and components.
China's trade surplus with the United States for the first two months of the year stood at $25.37 billion, Reuters calculation based on Chinese customs data showed, much narrower than a surplus of $42.16 billion in the same period last year.
Soybean imports in the first two months of 2020 rose by 14.2% year-on-year as cargoes from the U.S. booked during a trade truce at the end of 2019 cleared customs. 
After months of tensions and tariff hikes that dragged on bilateral trade, the world's two biggest economies agreed an interim trade deal in January that cut some U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Chinese pledges to massively increase purchases of U.S. goods and services.
The U.S. expects China to honor these commitments despite the coronavirus outbreak, a senior U.S. official said in February.
VIRUS THREATENS GLOBAL RECESSION 
The supply and demand shocks in China are likely to reverberate through global supply chains for months, and the rising number of virus cases and business disruptions in other countries is raising fears of a prolonged global slowdown or even recession.
In response, global policymakers have stepped up efforts to cushion the economic blow of the epidemic, with the U.S. Federal Reserve delivering an emergency rate cut last week.
Shortages of vital parts and components from China last month cost other countries and their industries $50 billion, a United Nations agency said on Wednesday.
The virus outbreak escalated in late January just as many businesses were winding down operations or closing for the long Lunar New Year holidays, and as hundreds of millions of Chinese were returning to their hometowns.
China customs said last month it would not release separate figures for January and would combine January and February instead, in line with how some of the country's other major indicators are released early in the year, which is intended to smooth distortions created by the holidays.
Tough public measures such as restrictions on travel and quarantines meant many of these people were unable to return to their jobs in offices, factories and ports until only recently.
Some firms which have reopened have faced shortages of parts and other raw materials as well as labor, while others report inventories of finished goods such as steel are piling up as downstream customers like car plants slowly crank up production again.
Iron ore imports rose 1.5% over the first two months, supported by firm demand at steel mills even though the coronavirus outbreak had disrupted downstream sectors.
Parts of central Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak and a major transport and manufacturing center, are expected to remain under lockdown well into March.
Analysts at Nomura estimate only 44% of the businesses worst affected by the outbreak had resumed operation as of March 1, and 62.1% across the economy as a whole. As such, they forecast economic growth will slump to 2% in the first quarter year-on-year, from 6% in the previous quarter.
Beijing has already stepped up support measures, including offering cheap loans to affected businesses, and policy sources have told Reuters that more steps are expected as authorities try to cushion the epidemic's impact on the economy.
China's commerce ministry said on Thursday that more than 70% of foreign trade companies in the coastal provinces have resumed work.

But financial magazine Caixin reported this week that some companies were keeping machines running and lights open throughout the day even though they have no goods to produce, in a bid to allow managers and local officials to inflate the official work resumption rate. Reuters wasn't able to verify this report.

The country's foreign exchange reserves - the world's largest - fell $8.779 billion in February to $3.107 trillion, central bank data showed on Saturday.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves would fall by $15.497 billion to $3.100 trillion, likely due to fluctuations in global exchange rates and the prices of foreign bonds that China holds.
Strict capital controls have helped China keep outflows under control over the past year despite a trade war with the United States and weakening economic growth at home.
But the yuan fell 0.78% against the dollar in February, its first monthly drop since August, while the dollar rose 0.77% as investors shifted money from virus-hit Asia into U.S. assets.
The virus outbreak and strict government measures used to contain its spread likely halved China's economic growth in the first quarter compared with the previous three months, triggering expectations for more interest rate cuts, according to the latest Reuters poll.
China held 62.64 million fine troy ounces of gold at the end of February, the same as at the end of January.
The value of China's gold reserves rose to $100.85 billion at the end of February from $99.24 billion at the end-January."
1119,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 12:56PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth robust before coronavirus outbreak hit shores,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers maintained a robust pace of hiring in February, giving the economy a strong boost heading into the coronavirus outbreak, which has stoked fears of a recession and prompted an emergency interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday also showed solid wage growth and the unemployment rate falling back to near a 50-year low of 3.5%. Employers also increased hours for workers last month.
But the strong report likely does not capture the impact of the coronavirus, which spread in the United States beginning in late February, leaving financial markets and economists to anticipate severe economic disruptions in the months ahead. Financial markets view the virus, which causes a flu-like illness, as the catalyst that could interrupt the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.
U.S. Treasury prices rallied, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond dropping to a record low of 0.695% US10YT=RR. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street tumbled, with the Dow Jones Industrial average diving more than 800 points at one point.
""Sadly, these job numbers are sure to be eclipsed by response to the spread of the coronavirus,"" said Michael Hicks an economist at Ball State University. ""The supply shocks from quarantined factories in Asia are weeks away from idling U.S. factories, and the demand-side impact on tourism, travel, eating and drinking establishments is already being felt across the world. The March jobs report, will be far less optimistic."" 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 273,000 jobs last month as unreasonably mild weather continued to boost hiring in weather-sensitive sectors, matching January's tally, which was the largest gain since May 2018.
While transportation and warehousing payrolls fell by 4,000 jobs in February, suggesting some early impact from the coronavirus, that was erased by strong gains nearly across all sectors, including government. The economy created 85,000 more jobs in December and January than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 175,000 jobs in February. Employment gains averaged 243,000 per month in the last three months. The economy needs to create roughly 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The government canvassed business in mid-February, before the country reported deaths from the virus and rising infections starting in the final week of the month.
At least 14 people have died in the United States from the respiratory disease called COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus and more than 200 have been infected. The disease has spread across 20 states. Overall, the fast-spreading disease has killed over 3,000 people and sickened nearly 100,000, mostly in China.
The highly contagious virus has rattled investors, resulting in the Fed on Tuesday slashing its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. It was the U.S. central bank's first emergency rate cut since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the economy's strong fundamentals, but said ""the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity."" Financial market are expecting further rates cuts at the Fed's March 17-18 policy meeting.
FISCAL STIMULUS NEEDED
Economists say fiscal stimulus is needed to cushion the economy against the disruptions from the coronavirus, though many are not yet forecasting a recession. Growth estimates for the first half are around 1%. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019.
Economic turmoil could hurt President Donald Trump who is seeking a second term in office in the Nov. 3 election. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday the government could take targeted measures to stimulate the economy, but added that more information was needed. 
While weekly applications for unemployment benefits, the most timely labor market indicator, have so far remained low, economists expect a rise in layoffs if the epidemic persists beyond the second half of this year and into 2021.
""Don't get too excited about the current condition of the economy, as the past is not likely to be prologue,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in February after gaining 0.2% in January. The annual increase in wages, however, slipped to 3.0% in February from 3.1% in January as last year's large gain falls out of the calculation.
The average workweek increased to 34.4 hours after holding at 34.3 hours for three straight months.
The jobless rate fell to 3.5% in February. It increased one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% in January as more people joined the labor force, in a sign of confidence in the job market. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one was unchanged at 63.4%, the highest since June 2013.
Construction payrolls increased by 42,000 last month after surging 49,000 in January. Manufacturing employment rebounded by 15,000 jobs after falling 20,000 in January. The gains are unlikely sustainable as the coronavirus is fracturing supply chains, and the production of Boeing's BA.N troubled 737 MAX jetliner remains suspended.
The drop in transportation and warehousing payrolls last month after increasing by 29,800 jobs in January was likely because of travel restrictions enforced by some authorities to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Traffic at West Coast ports has declined. A report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed the trade deficit dropped 6.7% to $45.3 billion in January as both imports and exports fell. 
Government payrolls increased by 45,000 in February, boosted by increases in state government education. About 7,000 temporary workers were hired for the decennial census.

Payrolls in the leisure and hospitality sector surged by 51,000 jobs. Healthcare and social assistance employment increased by 56,500 jobs. There were also increases in hiring in the professional and business services, and financial activities industries. Retail employment, however, fell again in February.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada gained a higher-than-expected 30,300 net jobs in February while the unemployment rate rose to 5.6%, official data showed on Friday, but analysts said the data was unlikely to trigger a rethink at the Bank of Canada as it tries to shield the economy from the effects of a coronavirus outbreak.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 10,000 jobs in February and an unemployment rate of 5.6%. Wages for permanent employees - a metric watched closely by the Bank of Canada - rose by 4.3%, Statistics Canada said.
Canada's central bank slashed a key interest rate on Wednesday by half a percentage point, the most in more than a decade, in light of the coronavirus outbreak and said it was prepared to ease further if needed. Money markets are anticipating another rate cut in April.[BOCWATCH]
""This report isn't going to matter much for upcoming Bank of Canada policy decisions,"" said Robert Both, a macrostrategist for TD Securities, despite the stronger-than-expected labor numbers.
""Broader market sentiment, especially around spread of coronavirus, is going to weigh much more heavily on upcoming decisions.""
The Canadian dollar weakened slightly to 1.3418, or 74.52 U.S. cents after the jobs report.
All the gains were in full-time jobs, Statscan said. Canada's goods-producing industries gained 5,600 net jobs, largely on manufacturing, which offset declines in the construction and natural resources industries.
The services sector saw an increase of 24,600 net positions, primarily on gains in the wholesale and retail trade sector.
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Thursday Canada's overall healthy labor market continued to be a good source of resilience even as an outbreak of coronavirus could seriously test Canada's economy.
""It does show that the economy actually did have a bit of momentum heading into the heavy weather of the coronavirus,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""It gives some credence to the view that the economy could or can recover after the storm passes.""
Meanwhile Canada posted a wider-than-expected trade deficit of C$1.47 billion ($1.10 billion) in January as exports fell, data in a separate Statscan release showed. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a shortfall of C$830 million.
Statscan also said it was monitoring the possible impacts of the coronavirus outbreak on Canada's international trade data, where the agency said ""substantial decreases in exports and imports with China"" had already been observed in January."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than expected in January as imports declined, and further decreases are likely as the coronavirus outbreak disrupts the flow of goods and services.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade deficit dropped 6.7% to $45.3 billion also as exports fell.
Data for December was revised slightly to show the trade gap widening to $48.6 billion instead of $48.9 billion as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap tightening to $46.1 billion in January.
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit fell $2.3 billion to $77.7 billion in January.
While the smaller trade deficit would provide a boost to the calculation of gross domestic product, declining imports mean less inventory accumulation, which could offset the lift to GDP.
Falling imports are also likely to lead to shortages, which could hurt both consumer and business spending.
The coronavirus epidemic has disrupted businesses and production in China, with Beijing extending the Lunar Year holidays in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.
Some factories that have restarted work are running below normal capacity, which economists says will weigh on Chinese exports.
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China increased 5.1% to $26.1 billion in January, with exports tumbling 18.7% and imports falling 1.2%.
Trade added 1.5 percentage points to GDP growth in the fourth quarter, exceeding the 1.17 percentage points contribution from consumer spending, which accounts for more
than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching the pace notched in the July-September period.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese homes extended their frugal spell for a fourth straight month in January as an earlier sales tax hike and a warmer winter kept wallets shut, adding to headaches for firms as they struggle with the growing hit to business from the coronavirus.
The world's third-largest economy is trying to cushion the blow to output and exports from the global health crisis, which threatens to tip it into its first recession in nearly five years.
Household spending fell 3.9% in January from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, largely in line with a median forecast for a 4.0% decline.
That marked the longest stretch of contraction since a five-month run to June 2018, a government official said.
The gloomy data suggests households were tightening their purse strings even before the coronavirus forced many retail outlets to close their doors in February and March as shoppers stayed at home.
""The reduction in going outside is likely to have a big impact, especially on spending related to services,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
The coronavirus crisis now threatens to spoil chances of the domestic-led recovery many policymakers had hoped for after the economy shrank at its fastest pace in nearly six years in the past quarter.
In central Tokyo's exclusive Aoyama district, some of the fashion and hairdressing shops are already seeing strains from the virus outbreak.
Clothing store manager Sayaka Nishi said her shop selling cotton dresses hand-woven in India is seeing noticeably fewer patrons, while foreign shoppers have fallen by as much as 90%.
""Customers aren't buying clothes that they would want to wear right now. My worry is about unsold items, such as spring coats,"" she said.
Florist Toshiyuki Fukano has seen sales drop by as much as a fifth from before the outbreak, partly due to order cancellations for concerts and weddings.
""The street has gotten really quiet,"" he said.
LOWER TRAVEL SPENDING
Household consumption had already been under pressure in recent months, after the government in October pushed ahead with the country's first sales tax rise since April 2014.
Spending in January fell 1.6% from the previous month, pulled down by lower spending on gasoline and overseas and domestic travel amid mild winter weather, a government official said.
Some people expect Japan's economy to get a boost from pent-up demand after the virus impact fades later in the year.
""Many people have stopped eating and drinking out altogether,"" said Daisaku Nagayoshi, whose firm produces marketing goods. He expects a burst of activity with people flocking to restaurants again once the virus threat clears.
The Bank of Japan may take steps this month to ensure companies hit by the virus do not face a financial squeeze before the March end of the current fiscal year, sources familiar with the central bank's thinking said on Thursday.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said earlier this week the virus could inflict serious damage on the economy, indicating a growing concern among BOJ policymakers over the deepening cost of the crisis.
Inflation-adjusted real wages provided a bright spot, gaining 0.7% in January to see the first rise in four months, labour ministry data showed on Friday.
The index of coincident indicators, which includes readings on factory output, employment and retail sales, rose to 94.7 in January from 94.4 in December, the Cabinet Office said.
The government maintained its view on the index as ""worsening"", suggesting the economy may be slipping into recession.
Japan's economy shrank an annualised 6.3% in the October-December period as the sales tax hike hit consumer and business spending. The Cabinet Office will publish revised GDP data on March 9 at 8:50 a.m. Japan time (2350 GMT, March 8).
A preliminary U.S.-China trade deal had raised hopes globally of a let-up in the pressure businesses face worldwide, in particular export-reliant nations like Japan.

But uncertainty over how the spread of the virus could affect global and Chinese economic growth has now cast a shadow on the BOJ's rosy economic projections.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the economy's strong fundamentals, but said, ""the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.""
""There is no evidence in this high-frequency indicator of any weakening in the labor market,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended Feb. 29, the Labor Department said. Jobless claims are the most timely labor market indicator and are being closely monitored for clues on the coronavirus' impact on the economy.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 215,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 3,250 to 213,000 last week.
The coronavirus, which causes a flu-like illness, has killed more than 3,000 people and sickened more than 90,000, mostly in China. In the United States, 11 people have died from the disease and the number of infections has exceeded 100.
The virus is disrupting supply chains and is also expected to undermine exports and demand for transportation, leisure and hospitality services. U.S. economic growth in the first half of the year is forecast around 1.0%. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed factory goods orders decreased 0.5% in January as demand for transportation equipment declined.
LAYOFFS LOW
So far, the labor market appears to be weathering the storm. In a third report, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said job cuts announced by U.S.-based companies fell 16.4% to 56,660 in February.
It said the coronavirus outbreak ""has not yet caused companies to cut positions,"" but said this ""may change if the supply side remains dormant.""
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the upbeat labor market data as investors worried about the spread of the coronavirus in the United States. Stocks on Wall Street fell, while prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher. The dollar (DXY) was weaker against a basket of currencies.
Last week's claims data has no bearing on February's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 175,000 jobs last month after surging by 225,000 in January. The unemployment rate is forecast to be steady at 3.6% in February.
The Fed's Beige Book on Wednesday, which is a survey of the central bank's business contacts around the country, showed a tight labor market was constraining hiring. It also noted that manufacturers, retailers, and transportation companies reported lower demand for labor in some districts.
Despite the tightening labor market conditions, wage inflation remains benign. In a fourth report on Thursday, the Labor Department said growth in unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - rose at a 0.9% rate last quarter, instead of the 1.4% pace reported last month.
Data for the third quarter was also revised down to show unit labor costs increasing at a 0.2% pace instead of advancing at a 2.5% rate as previously reported.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, labor costs grew at a 1.7% rate, revised down from the 2.4% pace estimated in February. Labor costs gained 1.7% in 2019 after rising 1.8% in 2018, suggesting inflation will probably continue to run below the Fed's 2% target.
Slower growth in labor costs could, however, ease pressure on corporate profit margins.
""While the fourth-quarter estimates provide a brief reprieve, profit margins have compressed because unit labor cost growth is outpacing revenue growth,"" said Dante DeAntonio, an economist with Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Shrinking margins feed into businesses being more cautious with hiring and investment decisions."""

Jobless claims fell by 3,000 to 216,000 in the week ended Feb. 29, according to Labor Department figures released Thursday that were in line with the median estimate in Bloomberg’s survey of economists. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, edged up to 213,000.
Key Insights
The data underscore tight conditions for those seeking jobs, and employers looking to fill positions. There’s so far little indication of a hit from the coronavirus in the data, which would be the first to indicate whether firms are starting to lay off employees. There’s concern among companies and economists that the virus will weaken demand.The figures come ahead of the government’s jobs report on Friday. Payrolls probably increased 175,000, below January’s pace but in line with the average of the past year, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The unemployment rate is seen holding near a 50-year low as wages keep marching higher.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that the half- point interest-rate cut Tuesday -- the first emergency cut since the 2008 financial crisis -- was meant to keep the economy strong “in the face of new risks to the economic outlook.”Separate data Thursday showed that productivity at the end of last year rose less than first reported. Nonfarm business employee output per hour increased at a 1.2% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. Unit labor costs were revised down to a 0.9% pace of growth from 1.4%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity jumped to a one-year high in February, suggesting strength in the economy before a recent escalation of recession fears ignited by the coronavirus epidemic that prompted an emergency interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.
The economy's solid fundamentals were also underscored by other data on Wednesday showing private payrolls increased more than expected in February, in part as unseasonably mild weather bolstered hiring at construction sites and in the leisure and hospitality industry. A report from the Fed described the economy as growing at ""a modest to moderate rate over the past several weeks,"" but noted rising concerns over the coronavirus.
The U.S. central bank on Tuesday slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%, in the Fed's first emergency rate cut since 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, ""The coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.""
""Going into any potential coronavirus slowdown, the economy is in good shape,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 57.3 last month, the highest level since February 2019, from 55.5 in January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to a reading of 54.9 in February.
The ISM said services industries remained ""positive about business conditions and the overall economy,"" but also noted that ""most respondents are concerned about the coronavirus and its supply chain impact."" 
The fast-spreading coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 people and sickened at least 90,000, mostly in China. In the United States, 10 people have died from the respiratory disease called COVID-19 caused by the virus and the number of infections exceeded 100, raising awareness of the disease among Americans starting the last week of February. 
Investors fear the coronavirus epidemic could derail the longest U.S. economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, through disruptions to supply chains and exports. The damage to the services sector is expected to come mostly through the transportation and tourism industries. Economists expect the coronavirus to restrain economic growth in the first half of the year to around 1.0%. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019.
The ISM reported on Monday that the manufacturing sector barely grew in February, with several industries saying the flu-like virus was impacting their businesses. So far, however, the vast services sector and labor market appear to be weathering the coronavirus storm. 
Separately on Wednesday, the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls gained 183,000 jobs last month after rising by a downwardly revised 209,000 in January. Economists had forecast private payrolls increasing 170,000 in February following the previously reported 291,000 surge in January.
Labor market strength was reinforced by the ISM survey, which showed its measure of services industry employment increased to a reading of 55.6 in February from 53.1 in January.
The data and a near sweep for Joe Biden in the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries to choose a presidential candidate for the Nov. 3 election boosted stocks on Wall Street. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond hovered below 1.0%. 
EMPLOYMENT REPORT EYED
The ADP report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report for February scheduled for release on Friday. The survey was conducted during the week including the 12th day of the month, to match the period when the government canvasses business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of the closely watched employment report. 
While the ADP report has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report because of methodology differences, the bigger-than-expected gain in hiring last month and rise in the ISM services employment gauge support economists' views of solid job growth in February.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government report on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 175,000 jobs last month after surging 225,000 in January. The unemployment rate is forecast steady at 3.6% in February.
Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told reporters that he had not seen anything to suggest a hit to the labor market from the coronavirus in the period after the survey week. Zandi, however, said he expected job growth to slow in the coming months because of the coronavirus and also as the boost from the unseasonably mild weather fades.
""COVID-19 will need to break through the job market firewall if it is to do significant damage to the economy,"" said Zandi. ""The firewall has some cracks, but judging by the February employment gain it should be strong enough to weather most scenarios.""
The ISM services industry survey bucked a separate survey from data firm IHS Markit, which showed the sector contracting in February. Economists dismissed the weak IHS Markit survey as ""noise,"" noting that several regional Federal Reserve surveys had shown improvement in their respective services industries.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry jumped to a reading of 63.1 in February from 56.2 in January. Order backlogs rebounded last month after contracting in January. Services industries also reported strong growth in export orders in February.

""Clearly that is not going to be sustained when the coronavirus outbreak worsens,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""But it does at least suggest the economy was on a stronger footing heading into the crisis.""

1130,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>","Bank of Canada takes cue from Fed and others, slashes rates over coronavirus fears","By Kelsey Johnson and David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada, taking its cue from other central banks, slashed a key interest rate by the most in more than a decade on Wednesday to help tackle a coronavirus outbreak and said it would cut again if necessary.
The bank lowered its benchmark overnight rate to 1.25% from 1.75%, prompting money markets to price in a better than even chance of another reduction next month.
Since last Friday, the world's top bankers have reassured markets they would try to head off the impact of the coronavirus. The U.S. Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia both cut rates on Tuesday.
The Bank of Canada said the outbreak was ""a material negative shock"" to the Canadian and global outlooks and predicted that as it spread, business and consumer confidence would deteriorate, further depressing economic activity.
""As the situation evolves, (the Bank's) Governing Council stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target,"" the bank said.
""The Bank continues to closely monitor economic and financial conditions, in coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal authorities.""
The move marked the first time in almost five years the bank had eased rates. The last time it cut by 50 basis points was in March 2009 during the global financial crisis. 
The Canadian dollar fell to 1.3416 to the U.S. greenback, or 74.54 U.S. cents, down from 1.3358, or 74.86 U.S. cents.
""We are seeing an economic slowdown. There will be an impact and we are there to find a solution,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Saint-Jerome, Quebec ahead of the rate decision.
Money markets quickly priced in a roughly 55% chance of another 25 basis point cut on April 15, when the bank is scheduled to unveil its next rate decision. [BOCWATCH]
""It's tough to get any upside out of this ... to be cutting 50 (basis points) and saying they stand ready to adjust monetary policy further. That's a clear cue that they're not done,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank.
Canada has only reported a handful of people with the coronavirus.
""It is likely that as this virus spreads, business and consumer confidence will deteriorate,"" the bank said, noting the Canadian dollar and commodity prices have depreciated. The bank had held rates steady since October 2018.
Finance Minister Bill Morneau on Tuesday said he was prepared to act quickly to help companies hurt by the coronavirus and would not need to wait for the next budget, which is usually unveiled in March. 
Nathan Janzen, senior economist at the Royal Bank of Canada, said he expected the budget would contain fiscal measures to address the effects of the outbreak.
Canada is a major exporter of oil, which has seen prices slump in recent months. 

The Bank of Canada said it was becoming clear first quarter annualized growth would be weaker than the 1.3% it forecast on Jan 22.

1131,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 10:16AM ET</span>",U.S. Services Gauge Hits One-Year High Before Virus Fallout,"(Bloomberg) -- America’s service industries in February enjoyed the fastest growth in a year as orders surged, showing momentum in the biggest part of the economy just as coronavirus concerns started to become more widespread.
The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index unexpectedly rose 1.8 points to 57.3 in January, according to data Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a decline to 54.8. The third straight increase capped the longest stretch of gains since 2014. Figures above 50 show expansion.
A gauge of orders increased to the highest level since June 2018 and a measure of employment reached a seven-month high. While the improvement within service industries is at odds with a setback at factories during the same month, the risk for the economy is that the virus causes consumers to shy away from travel, entertainment and dining out.
“Most respondents are concerned about the coronavirus and its supply chain impact,” Anthony Nieves, chair of the group’s non-manufacturing business survey committee, said in a statement. “They also continue to have difficulty with labor resources. They do remain positive about business conditions and the overall economy.”
A separate gauge of service industries from IHS Markit dropped 4 points to 49.4, marking the first time since October 2013 that the measure has shown declining activity.
At the same time, business activity at health care providers is likely to increase amid industry efforts to battle the virus and ramp up production of medical supplies. Construction and real estate firms, meanwhile, are staying busy as home sales heat up.
More Expanding
The ISM report showed 16 non-manufacturing industries reported growth in February, led by accommodation and food services, mining, finance and real estate. Entertainment and recreation and agriculture indicated declining activity.
The ISM’s gauge of services employment increased to 55.6 from 53.1, indicating more firms are adding to their payrolls. Private hiring at service providers in the first two months of the year was the strongest since early 2018, according to data Wednesday from the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute. Official data are due Friday from the Labor Department.

The ISM’s index of business activity among non-manufacturers, which parallels the group’s measure of factory production, eased in February to a still-healthy 57.8 from 60.9. Order backlogs also increased, posting the strongest advance since May 2018.
The nation’s manufacturers, according to the ISM’s February data, experienced the brunt of the initial fallout from the virus. The group’s gauge showed near-stagnant activity as production slumped on the heels of virus-disrupted supply chains in Asia.
While the manufacturing supplier deliveries gauge jumped by the most since June 2018, indicating longer lead times, the same measure for services ticked only slightly higher. Instead, the jump in orders, which was the largest in more than two years, played a bigger role in boosting the ISM non-manufacturing index in February.

1132,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 10:08AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Cuts Rates 50 Basis Points, Stands Ready for More","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada cut half a percentage point from its benchmark interest rate Wednesday, easing monetary policy for the first time in more than four years as it followed the Federal Reserve in trying to protect its economy from the coronavirus.
The central bank lowered its overnight rate to 1.25% from 1.75% and said the spread of the coronavirus represents a “material negative shock” to the Canadian and global outlooks. Officials said they’ll act again to reduce rates if necessary.
“Governing council stands ready to adjust monetary policy further if required to support economic growth and keep inflation on target,” policy makers said in a statement, adding the move is part of a global response to the crisis.
The cut is the bank’s first since mid-2015 and marks a reversal for Governor Stephen Poloz, whose prolonged resistance to lowering borrowing costs left the country with the highest policy rate among advanced economies. His position became increasingly untenable with the rout in global equities on concern the spread of the coronavirus could touch off a worldwide slowdown.
Policy makers were quick to highlight why a 50-basis-point cut, the first since the 2008-2009 recession, was necessary, saying “the outlook is clearly weaker now than it was in January.” Poloz is due to speak Thursday in Toronto to provide insight into the decision. The bank’s next meeting is April 15.
The virus has driven economic activity down sharply in some regions, disrupted supply chains, pulled down commodity prices and prompted a repricing of risk that has tightened financial conditions, policy makers said, warning the situation could worsen.
“It is likely that as the virus spreads, business and consumer confidence will deteriorate, further depressing activity,” they said.
Several domestic factors are also weighing on first-quarter growth, including rail blockades, winter storms, weaker than expected business investment and a teachers strike in Ontario, the bank said.
The move is part of an anticipated wave of easing from central banks around the world, and follows the Fed’s emergency decision on Tuesday to cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point.Today’s cut still leaves the Bank of Canada with the highest policy rate among Group of Seven countries, and 12.5 basis points above the Fed’s rate.
The shift was expected. In trading Tuesday, markets assigned better than even odds Poloz would match the half-point of the Fed. That’s an abrupt change from last week when odds of even a 25-basis-point cut sat at just 30%.
Of 32 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, 30 predicted at least a 25-basis-point reduction, and half of those called for the full 50 points.
“COVID-19 was the icing on the cake for the Bank of Canada to cut,” Derek Holt, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said by email before the announcement. “It solidified the pre-existing case to give a weak economy a shot in the arm.” Holt shifted his call to 1.25% on Tuesday.
Policy makers had already shifted to a dovish stance in January due to deteriorating economic data, and the rapidly accumulating risks over the past week finally tilted them into action.
The easier monetary policy should boost the disposable incomes of millions with variable rate mortgages. Still, with some of the highest household debt levels among developed countries, it risks adding to financial system vulnerabilities as consumption and housing accelerates.
Wednesday’s statement provided no mention of the increased financial risks to debt associated with the bout of monetary easing."

IHS Markit's Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone, the first key gauge of February's economic health published, nudged up to 51.6 from January's 51.3. That matched an earlier flash reading and was well clear of the 50-mark separating growth from contraction.
""The euro zone economy showed resilience to disruptions arising from the coronavirus outbreak in February, but dig deeper into the data and there are signs that problems lie ahead,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Exports of both goods and services are now falling at an increased rate due to virus-related downturns in demand, and increasingly widespread delivery delays threaten future production.""
A sub-index measuring new export business dropped to 47.5 from 49.2 and, as they have for a year, firms turned to completing backlogs of work to drive some activity.
Williamson said the headline index pointed to first quarter GDP growth of 0.1-0.2% but cautioned there were clear downside risks and a likely weakening this month. A Reuters poll last month predicted growth of 0.2%. [ECILT/EU]
The PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry rose to 52.6 from 52.5 but was below an earlier flash reading of 52.8.
Optimism among services firms waned last month and they increased headcount at a slower rate. The business expectations index dropped to 61.3 from January's 61.9."

Retail sales rose by 0.9% on the month in real terms after an upwardly revised drop of 2.0% in the previous month, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. This was slightly below a Reuters forecast of analysts for a 1.0% increase.
On the year, retail sales rose by 1.8% in real terms after an upwardly revised rise of 1.7% in December, the data showed.
Retail sales are a volatile indicator often subject to revision.
The figures suggest that household spending is holding up in Germany, helped by record-high employment, solid wage increases and moderate inflation, though the coronavirus epidemic could weaken domestic demand in the weeks ahead.
A survey showed last month that German consumer morale deteriorated slightly heading into March as fears that the coronavirus outbreak could worsen an economic slowdown made Germans less willing to take out their wallets."

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged up marginally to 48.4 from 48.3 in January, remaining below the 50 level that separates expansion from contraction, as the sub-index measuring employment fell at a record rate.
South Africa has struggled to emerge from a deep slump in the two years since Cyril Ramaphosa became president with the promise of enacting sweeping economic reforms.
The economy entered its second recession in two years in the final quarter of last year, data showed on Tuesday.
The unemployment sub-index registered a fourth consecutive months of contraction, to 46.7 in February from 48.3 in January. That marked the fastest drop in employment since the reading began in its current form in July 2011.
""With new orders falling again and cost inflation accelerating, many South African businesses decided to cut into payroll numbers in February,"" said David Owen, an economist at IHS Markit.
Owen added that the coronavirus outbreak had started to have a notable impact on the South African economy, with the shutdown of factories in China leading to a steep lengthening of input delivery times.
""Port congestion ...meant that many businesses were forced to limit activity, with exports to China also decreasing,"" Owen said.
The coronavirus outbreak was plunging the world economy into its worst downturn since the global financial crisis, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned on Monday, urging governments and central banks to fight back to avoid an even steeper slump.
On the price front, respondents said that a weaker rand and delays in Chinese imports often led to inflated purchasing costs, IHS Markit said.
""Firms commented that slower freight shipments and rising port congestion meant that inputs often took longer to arrive. As such, vendor performance deteriorated at the sharpest rate in over five-and-a-half years,"" IHS Markit said in a statement."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's economy expanded by more than expected last quarter, erasing the risk of a recession even as raging bushfires and the coronavirus crisis wreaked havoc with tourism and travel at the start of the new year.
Wednesday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed the A$2 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy accelerated by 0.5% last quarter. Encouragingly, the previous quarter was revised upwards to show 0.6% increase from 0.4% earlier.
That took the annual pace to 2.3%, still well below the 2.75% that policy makers consider ""trend"".
Economists had predicted a quarterly rate of 0.3%, according to a median of 16 economists polled by Reuters.
The stronger-than-expected data sent the local dollar rising 0.4% to $0.6611 from $0.6577 before.
The outlook is murkier though, as the coronavirus epidemic is seen dealing a greater blow to world economies than earlier expected.
Such are the risks that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates to an historic low of 0.5% this week, just part of an urgent global response to the virus that saw the Federal Reserve spring an emergency policy easing.
Prime Minster Scott Morrison has also flagged an imminent burst of targeted fiscal stimulus, a major u-turn for the conservative government that has long scorned such action.
""We view this shift in fiscal policy as a very positive development, but still expect further support from the RBA will be required given the extent of the shock and since the economy was underperforming prior to the outbreak,"" said Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB.
He sees another quarter point rate cut in April and suspects the central bank would then have to consider quantitative easing including buying government bonds."

The AIB IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services rose to 59.9 from 56.9 in January, well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""The robust expansion in service activity is being driven by strong growth in new business,"" said AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan, adding that new exports orders, which had weakened a lot in 2019, had picked up considerable strength.
However, ""buoyant business conditions would appear to be leading to increasing cost pressures in all service industries,"" he said.
An easing of uncertainty around Brexit has helped solidify seven years of uninterrupted growth in the Irish services sector over the past few months.
But the authors said concern was beginning to emerge about Britain's future trade settlement with the European Union and political deadlock following an national general election on Feb. 8.
Those concerns helped nudge the Business Expectations subindex, which measures the outlook for the coming 12-months, down a three-month low of 68.4 from 71.1 in January."

The adjusted IHS Markit headline Hong Kong Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) dived to 33.1 in February, from 46.8 in January and marked the steepest downturn since at least 1998, when the survey began. The previous record low, at 38.1, was posted during a 2003 epidemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus.
The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The fast-spreading virus has killed nearly 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China, a vital source of trade for the city which has so far reported two deaths and around 100 cases.
The outbreak has dealt a double blow to Hong Kong's economy and its retail and tourism sectors, which have been battered by months of political protests.
""Measures taken in response to the Covid-19 situation and general fear of being infected saw business activity and new sales sinking at a record pace in an economy that has been beset earlier by political protests and U.S.-China trade war tensions,"" said Bernard Aw, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""Business confidence plummeted in the city, with a majority of firms anticipating lower future output amid expectations that the coronavirus situation will persist in coming months.""
Underscoring the virus' debilitating impact on factories, the output gauge plunged to 22.5 last month, from 46.7 in January while that for new orders showed an equally steep dive to 22.7 from 43.0 the month earlier.
Demand from mainland China shrank to a survey-record low in February. There were also reports of a rise in order cancellations.
Business confidence, a forward-looking subcomponent in the survey, plummeted to the lowest level since the data were first available in April 2012, with a majority of survey respondents predicting lower output over the next 12 months due to concerns that the negative impact of the virus on activity was likely to persist n the months ahead.
Official forecasts for the Hong Kong's economy range between a 1.5% contraction in 2020 and 0.5% growth. The government has announced a record budget deficit this year to tackle the impact of the virus and of months of often violent protests."

The final seasonally adjusted au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slumped to 46.8 in February from 51.0 in the previous month, its lowest reading since April 2014 when a nationwide tax hike jolted the economy.
The headline figure was slightly above a preliminary reading of 46.7. The survey data highlighted a widening fallout from the coronavirus epidemic just as consumers were coming to grips with October's tax hike, with new business contracting at the fastest pace in eight-and-a-half years.
Japan's economy is ""exceedingly likely"" to slip into recession in the current quarter following its contraction in the three months to December unless it sees an exceptional rebound in March, said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
""Policymakers are powerless in offsetting the economic effects of coronavirus,"" Hayes said.
""Supply chains are likely to face bottlenecks as Chinese vendors face heavy backlogs, while increasing cases of COVID-19 outside of China will do little to spur consumers to travel and go out to restaurants.""
Firms were hit by lower levels of tourism because of fewer foreign visitors in Japan, with survey respondents saying they had to close their stores due to a lack of work.
Business expectations fell, growing at the slowest pace since July 2016, suggesting the economy is likely to remain under pressure for the time being.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, also shrank at the fastest pace since April 2014, falling to 47.0 from January's final 51.0."
1140,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 05:21AM ET</span>",Euro-Area Inflation Hits Three-Month Low on Energy-Price Slump,"(Bloomberg) --
Euro-area inflation slowed to a three-month low in February, highlighting how disruption unleashed by the spreading coronavirus is hitting the bloc’s economy.
A slump in oil and other commodities triggered by factory closures around the world pushed down the region’s headline rate to 1.2%. The reading may buoy investors’ bets that the European Central Bank will add stimulus to bolster the economy, after President Christine Lagarde pledged an “appropriate and targeted” response in a statement late last night.
ECB policy makers are a little over one week away from their next scheduled meeting. Yet action may be taken sooner -- an emergency meeting of Group of 7 finance ministers and central bankers is due to take place at 1 p.m. Frankfurt time on Tuesday. A joint statement is being prepared for release later in the afternoon.
The ECB’s main challenge is that -- unlike the Federal Reserve -- it has limited room to act. There’s little appetite among officials to push the deposit rate further below zero, even though financial markets are pricing in a cut. Asset purchases are already close to maxing out the institution’s self-imposed limits, and liquidity is provided in abundance.
Complicating policy makers’ quest for the best response is uncertainty about whether the crisis is predominantly driven by a hit to supply or demand.
Many companies have temporarily shut down production since the virus broke out in China late last year, disrupting global supply chains. Resulting shortages of certain products could potentially push up prices.
“An interest-rate cut certainly wouldn’t be the right answer then,” Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Friday.
A demand shock, where people stay home and push pause on major purchases, could have the opposite effect. But even then policy makers are questioning whether any more central-bank stimulus would have an effect, and have cautioned against rushing into action.
Core inflation, one of the ECB’s preferred measure to judge underlying price pressures, accelerated to 1.2% in February. Energy prices dropped 1.6% on the month, reflecting a decline in crude oil costs.
Separate reports showed unemployment held steady at 7.4% in January, while an annual decline in producer prices eased.
Inflation Outlook
Any policy response by the ECB will ultimately depend on how the coronavirus epidemic affects the euro area’s inflation outlook. New economic projections will be available next week, although in a fast-moving situation like the current one, they may already be out of date by the time of publication.
So far, officials have stressed they consider governments and fiscal stimulus the first line of defense -- even though they haven’t fully ruled out action themselves.
“We are not going to overreact,” ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Monday. “We will be calm, prudent. When we do react, it will be in line with our mandate.”"

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52.6 from 48.4 in January, just below the Reuters poll forecast of 48.8 and representing less of a jump than in the previous month.
But the index showed growth for the first time since April 2019 -- after the extension of an original Brexit deadline -- and hit its highest level since December 2018.
New orders jumped in February to hit their highest level since December 2015.
Britain's economy has picked up since Johnson's election win, which removed the risk of further uncertainty about when Britain would leave the European Union and the possibility of a shift to the left under a Labour-led government.
Some respondents in the PMI survey said contracts from the recently announced High Speed 2 rail network and other major transport projects could boost infrastructure work at their businesses in the year ahead.
The recovery in February's output would have been stronger without bad weather during the month, other respondents said.
IHS Markit said it would look to next month's data to gauge any impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
""While construction order books have begun to recover in the opening part of 2020, the fly in the ointment is the uncertain impact of the coronavirus outbreak on UK economic growth prospects,"" Tim Moore, economic director at survey compiler IHS Markit said.
""A renewed slowdown could see domestic investment spending put back on hold and dampen the outlook for the UK construction sector,"" Moore said.
The global impact of coronavirus is starting to weigh on a post-election recovery in British manufacturing as factories reported a big jump in delays in their supply chains, a PMI survey showed on Monday.
The construction PMI showed companies were less optimistic about their growth prospects than in January but were still more positive about the outlook than in the second half of 2019."
1142,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 02:12AM ET</span>",Coronavirus Is Disrupting British Factories’ Supply Chains,"(Bloomberg) --
The coronavirus outbreak is starting to feed through to British factory supply chains, casting doubt on whether an upswing in activity after Boris Johnson’s election will continue.
IHS Markit said Monday that U.K. manufacturing grew slightly less in February than it first estimated. The index for output slipped to 51.7 from the initial 51.9 reading. The pound traded down 0.4% at $1.2766 as of 9:33 a.m.
The report showed that the outbreak led to material delivery delays, rising input costs and increased pressure on stocks of purchases. Overseas demand decreased for a fourth month.
The figures come as Bank of England promised to “ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.” Governor Mark Carney on Friday warned that the spread of the disease was already impacting the U.K. economy, disrupting companies’ operations and reducing tourism.
“The U.K. manufacturing sector remained in recovery mode,” said Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit. “With supply-chain headwinds rising, and trade negotiations with the EU starting, it remains to be seen whether the recovery can stay on course during the coming months.”
Some companies surveyed also reported efforts to re-route supply chains away from the U.K. following Brexit, contributing to weaker demand from the European Union, Markit said.
Still, output rose at the fastest pace in ten months, according to the report.
Separately, the BOE on Monday said that mortgage approvals rose to the highest since since February 2016.

1143,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>",RBA Cuts Rates to 0.5% as China Slowdown Continues,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank validated the money market’s late swing, easing interest rates in an effort to cushion the blow from China’s economic slowdown and associated coronavirus fallout.
Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe reduced the cash rate by a quarter percentage point to 0.5%, a new record low, as expected by traders and predicted by half of the economists surveyed. Markets moved rapidly over the weekend following an escalation of contagion fear. At the close of business in Australia Friday, markets were pricing in just a 15% chance of a cut.
The outbreak “is having a significant effect on the Australian economy at present, particularly in the education and travel sectors. The uncertainty that it is creating is also likely to affect domestic spending,” Lowe said in a statement in Sydney announcing the decision. “The board is prepared to ease monetary policy further to support the Australian economy.”
The Australian dollar jumped 0.4% following the RBA decision and is currently trading at 65.54 U.S. cents at 2:38 p.m. Sydney.
The move means the RBA now has only one 25 basis-point cut left in the locker before it reaches the effective lower bound, opening the door to unconventional measures. It cut three times last year wagering that, together with tax rebates and a rebounding property market, households would resume spending.
From education to tourism to agriculture and resources, the viral epidemic will set back Australia. It is the most China-reliant economy in the developed world with about a third of its exports going there. The government in Canberra insisted that any fiscal response would be considered and targeted, contrasting it with the opposition’s cash splash of 2008-09.
Global policy makers have sought to reassure markets they are ready to respond to the epidemic as fears mount that the world economy is heading toward recession. The leaders of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank said they stood ready to help member nations, while Group of Seven finance ministers and monetary officials will speak by teleconference Tuesday.
“Policy measures have been announced in several countries, including China, which will help support growth,” Lowe said in the statement.
Upcoming data released this week in Australia are set to capture the blow from the wildfires that engulfed the country’s drought-parched east coast in December and January, before the virus delivers its follow-up hit.
Gross domestic product probably rose 0.4% in the final three months of 2019 from the prior quarter, and 2% from a year earlier, economists estimated ahead of data Wednesday.
“GDP growth in the March quarter is likely to be noticeably weaker than earlier expected,” Lowe said. “Given the evolving situation, it is difficult to predict how large and long-lasting the effect will be. Once the coronavirus is contained, the Australian economy is expected to return to an improving trend.”
One area helping Lowe is the currency, the economy’s traditional shock absorber that has depreciated almost 7% since the start of the year. The governor’s easing last year matched that of his Federal Reserve counterpart, helping ensure the Aussie dollar didn’t climb against the greenback."
1144,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 03:31PM ET</span>","Brazil posts $3.1 billion trade surplus in Feb, no coronavirus impact yet","By Marcela Ayres
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted a trade surplus of $3.1 billion in February, official data showed on Monday, far stronger than forecast and confounding any expectations that the coronavirus outbreak might have dampened exports.
February's figure was double the median consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists of a $1.5 billion surplus, a result of exports totaling $16.4 billion and imports reaching $13.3 billion.
Speaking to reporters in Brasilia, Herlon Brandão, undersecretary for foreign trade statistics, said any hit to Brazilian exports to No. 1 trading partner China resulting from the coronavirus outbreak has yet to be felt.
""The effect (of coronavirus) is probably gradual and is heterogeneous across sectors. It may yet have some effect in March, but it was not noticeable in February's data,"" Brandao said.
""On the contrary, we saw an increase in exports, an increase in trade,"" he said, adding that soy exporters, for example, have not reported any changes.
Overall exports rose 15.5% in February from a year ago, and imports rose 16.7%, the figures showed. Exports to China, Hong Kong and Macau jumped 20.9%.
Despite the surprisingly high surplus in February, trade is still expected to be a net drag on Brazil's economy this year. Exports are likely to suffer from a sharp slowdown in global growth, continued weakness in neighboring Argentina and now an anticipated steep fall in demand from China.
China accounts for almost 30% of Brazil's exports, and its economy is likely to take a huge hit from the coronavirus outbreak, with growth forecast to fall to its lowest level in three decades.
So far, there has been little evidence that the real's slide to a record low of 4.50 per dollar is boosting overseas demand for Brazilian goods, while imports are still expected to rise this year."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory manufacturing activity slowed in February as new orders contracted, reflecting worries about supply chain disruptions related to the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, which has revived financial market fears of a recession.
While other data on Monday showed construction spending increased by the most in nearly two years, hitting a record high in January, the upbeat news was overshadowed by the coronavirus epidemic. Global stock markets have tumbled, with Wall Street's key indexes suffering their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis last week. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell below 1% for the first time since 2016.
Investors worry the flu-like virus could derail the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday described the U.S. economy's fundamentals as ""strong,"" but acknowledged that ""the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" and said the U.S. central bank would ""use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.""
""It is more critical than ever for companies to get those supply chain inputs used in production from China, otherwise the manufacturing sector may indeed fall back into a recession,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 50.1 last month from 50.9 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would slip to 50.5 in February.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy.
The ISM index pulled above the 50 threshold in January for the first time in five months, as trade tensions between the United States and China eased following the signing of a partial deal that month. But the coronavirus epidemic, which has killed at least 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000, most of them in China, is a new threat for factories.
Data and some regional Fed factory surveys had hinted at some stabilization in manufacturing after it slumped last year. With manufacturing barely expanding, that could put pressure on the Trump Administration to suspend all U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.
The ISM said ""global supply chains are impacting most, if not all, of the manufacturing industry sectors."" About six industries, including computers and electronics, fabricated metal and chemical producers, reported the coronavirus outbreak was impacting their businesses.
Reports from around the world on Monday also showed factories taking a beating from the coronavirus outbreak, with activity in China shrinking at a record pace. Japan's PMI showed its factory activity was hit by the sharpest contraction in nearly four years in February. In South Korea, factory activity also shrank faster in February.
In addition to fracturing the supply chain and undercutting exports, the outbreak has led to a slowdown in travel plans that is also seen hampering the services industry.
Apple (O:AAPL) last month warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first quarter of 2020 and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected.
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to a reading of 49.8 in February from 52.0 in January. A measure of exports orders fell last month and a gauge of imports tumbled to its lowest level since May 2009. The shortage of raw materials was underscored by a sharp rise in the length of time suppliers are taking to deliver inputs.
""Parts are scarce at an increasing number of companies,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The White House should suspend all Chinese tariffs immediately, it won't do a whole lot of good at this point, but it cannot hurt and President Trump can always re-impose them later.
The ISM's factory employment index remained in contraction territory in February, suggesting manufacturing payrolls could remain weak after declining in December and January.
A separate report on Monday from the data firm IHS Markit showed its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index slid to 50.7 in February from 51.9 in January.
U.S. stock indexes rose on Monday, recouping some of last week's losses, on bargain hunting and hopes that monetary stimulus from central banks would help tide over the potential economic impact of the coronavirus. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading higher while the dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies.
'MAD DASH'
The ISM said 14 industries reported growth last month, while three contracted. Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said the ""coronavirus is wreaking havoc on the electronics industry,"" adding ""it's a mad dash to dual source stateside in case China isn't back online soon.""
Chemical products manufacturers said the coronavirus and Boeing's (N:BA) decision to suspend production of its troubled 737 MAX airplane had ""suppressed new orders."" Manufacturers of food, beverage and tobacco products warned of weaker demand for goods made in China as well as ""significant delays to production,"" because of supply bottle necks.
A third report on Monday from the Commerce Department showed construction spending surged 1.8% to a record high of $1.369 trillion as investment in both private and public projects increased.
But economists worried the coronavirus could stunt growth.
""Mild weather and low rates are giving construction a boost,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""However, supply chain disruptions stemming from the coronavirus may exert upward pressure on a wide array of imported materials prices, ranging from steel and cement to fixtures and furnishings, and hamper activity."""
1146,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2020 10:21AM ET</span>",U.S. construction spending increases to record high,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending increased by the most in nearly two years in January, but the upbeat news is likely to be overshadowed by financial market fears that the fast-spreading coronavirus could tip the economy into recession.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending surged 1.8% to a record high of $1.369 trillion as
investment in both private and public projects increased. Data for December was revised up to show construction outlays rising
0.2% instead of decreasing 0.2% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would increase 0.6% in January. Construction spending advanced 6.8% on a year-on-year basis in January.
The coronavirus epidemic, which has killed at least 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000, has left financial markets
fearing the end of the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.
U.S. stock indexes suffered their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis last week as investors sold equities and bought U.S. Treasuries. The yield on the two-year Treasury note fell below 1% for the first time since 2016.
In January, spending on private construction projects jumped 1.5% to the highest level since February 2018, after gaining 0.1% in December. It was boosted by a 2.1% surge in spending on homebuilding after a 1.5% increase in December.
Residential construction is being supported by lower mortgage rates. Residential investment increased solidly in the second half of 2019, after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the last recession.
Spending on nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing plant and mining exploration, shafts and wells, increased 0.8% in January. Spending on nonresidential structures fell 1.5% in December. The government in its fourth-quarter GDP report last week said spending on nonresidential structures contracted in 2019 by the most since 2016.
Outlays on private non-residential structures have been depressed by a manufacturing downturn due to trade tensions and cheaper energy products.
Investment in public construction projects increased 2.6% in January after gaining 0.6% in December.
Spending on state and local government construction projects surged 2.0% after rising 0.5% in December. Outlays on federal government construction projects soared 9.9% in January to the highest level since May 2012.
That followed a 1.5% increase in December."

(Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity grew at the most tepid pace in six months in February as the supply chain disruptions arising from the coronavirus outbreak dragged on output and new orders, a survey of purchasing managers showed on Monday.
The final reading of the IHS Markit U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index slid to 50.7 last month from 51.9 in January. The data was slightly weaker than the preliminary - or ""flash"" - reading of 50.8 reported in mid-February and was the lowest reading since August.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in the sector.
""Manufacturing production and order book trends deteriorated markedly in February as producers struggled against the double headwinds of falling export sales and supply chain delays, both in turn often linked to the coronavirus outbreak,"" Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said in a statement.
""Historical comparisons against official data indicate that the survey is consistent with factory production and orders both falling at annualized rates of around 3%, with manufacturing jobs being lost at a monthly rate of roughly 20,000.""
Williamson said companies are worried that the outbreak, which until now has largely delivered only a supply shock, could soon hurt demand and that the recent stock market volatility could hurt consumer spending and business investment. U.S. stocks suffered their biggest weekly decline last week since the financial crisis, wiping out roughly $4 trillion in market value.
Markit will report its final reading on the services sector on Wednesday. In its flash report on Feb. 21, it said services activity had fallen to the lowest since October 2013 and that a sector accounting for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy was in contraction for the first time since 2016."

LONDON (Reuters) - The global impact of coronavirus is starting to weigh on a post-election recovery in Britain's manufacturing sector as factories reported a big jump in delays in their supply chains, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.7 from the no-change level of 50.0 in January.
That was its highest since April but slightly weaker than February's ""flash"" reading of 51.9.
Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said Britain's manufacturers were still in recovery mode after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's national election win in December, which lifted some of the uncertainty hanging over the country's economy.
New orders grew at the fastest pace in 11 months and business optimism hit a nine-month high.
But Dobson pointed to clouds on the horizon from the spreading coronavirus.
""Supply-chain disruptions were emerging rapidly ... as the COVID-19 outbreak led to a substantial lengthening of supplier lead times, raw material shortages, reduced inventories of inputs, rising input costs and reduced export orders from Asia and China in particular,"" he said.
Coronavirus - which has prompted authorities in China to shutter entire cities - plus the impact of flooding in Britain led to the biggest drop in supplier delivery times in the 28-year history of the survey.
Companies used up their stocks, which pushed down inventories at the fastest rate in over seven years while shortages of some raw materials led to price increases, part of which was passed on to clients.
Furthermore, some firms said foreign clients were moving supply chains away from Britain after its departure from the European Union on Jan. 31.
A continued downturn in demand for investment goods, which are used to produce other goods, suggested business confidence levels have yet to recover sufficiently to support a sustained rise in capital spending, Dobson said.
""With supply-chain headwinds rising, and trade negotiations with the EU starting, it remains to be seen whether the recovery can stay on course during the coming months,"" he said.
Manufacturing accounts for around 10% of Britain's economic output, according to official data, although many analysts say that does not take into account the increasingly blurred line between the services and manufacturing sectors."

The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index plunged to 35.7 in February from 50 the previous month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday. Even before that data, the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was that the economy would shrink in the three months through March from the last quarter of 2019, and the surprisingly weak data prompted further cuts to that view.
Gross domestic product may now shrink by 2.5% in the first quarter from the previous period, Nomura Holdings Inc. economists led by Lu Ting said in a report Saturday after the data release. That was a cut from their previous forecast of -1.5% in a Bloomberg survey last week.  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) Plc already expected a 1.5% contraction before the data, while Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. is forecasting a 2% drop, according to reports after the release.
Bloomberg Economics now expects a contraction of 3%, but cautioned that it’s subject to considerable uncertainty.
“The extent of the slump in China, the blow to global supply chains, and the trajectory of the outbreak in China and globally are all difficult to gauge with a high degree of accuracy,” Bloomberg economists led by Chang Shu wrote in a report.
China Factory Activity Weakest on Record Due to Coronavirus
If the economy were to contract, it would be the first time that’s happened in comparable data dating back to 2011.
Pacific Investment Management Co. also sees the virus outbreak causing a contraction, forecasting a 6% annualized drop in China’s first-quarter GDP, while  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank Plc economists see an 8.9% drop, followed by a quick recovery. Pimco’s view gels with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists, who said in a report Friday that global GDP will shrink on a quarterly basis in the first two quarters of this year before rebounding in the second half.
The factory PMI data may improve in March, CICC analysts including Yue Yan wrote in a note Saturday.
“Strenuous containment measures were taken after the outbreak of COVID-19, which understandably dampened economic activities in the short term,” they wrote. “With the outbreak gradually under control, government agencies have been clearing the unwanted obstacles for production resumption.”
Nomura’s Lu also expects the March PMIs to rebound, but says activity data will be zero or negative as businesses won’t be completely back.
On a year-on-year comparison, the median forecast for first-quarter GDP growth is 4.3%. That was before Saturday’s data. Nomura and ANZ both now see it rising 2%, while Standard Chartered expects a 2.8% expansion.

The manufacturing slowdown offers the clearest evidence yet of the epidemic's damaging effects on global growth and businesses and is likely to ramp up pressure on Japanese policymakers to boost growth.
The au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to a seasonally-adjusted 47.8 from a final 48.8 in the previous month. The February reading was its lowest since May 2016.
The index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a 10th month, marking the longest stretch since a 16-month run to June 2009 during the global financial crisis.
""Near-term prospects for Japan's industrial sector appear very bleak,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Weakness was driven by the demand-side in a broad-based fashion. Consumer, intermediate and capital goods producers recorded faster declines in demand and overall order books fell at the sharpest rate in over seven years.""
The pressure on the world's third-largest economy has built rapidly during the past weeks as the virus outbreak is dealing a sharp blow to China's economy, Asia's biggest.
China is one of Japan's top export markets, and many Japanese firms sell their products to Chinese customers to supply its factories with parts and equipment for manufacturing.
The PMI survey showed new orders falling at the fastest pace in more than seven years due to weak economic conditions and lower sales to customers in China.
Other indicators such as overall output and backlogs of work also dropped, while new export orders contracted for the 15th straight month. Hayes also said that some Japanese companies reported they were unable to source key raw materials from suppliers in China.
""Existing buffer stocks helped to offset some of the shortfall, but if supply chain disruptions carry on for an extended period then the risk to industrial output will be far greater,"" he added."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's economy grew by a weaker-than-expected 0.3% in 2019 as the oil sector contracted sharply, official data showed on Sunday, although the non-oil sector accelerated.
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, wants to boost the private sector and diversify its economy away from oil, but sliding oil prices and crude output cuts agreed with OPEC allies continue to weigh on its overall growth.
Real economic growth in the non-oil sector increased by 3.3% last year, according to data from the General Authority for Statistics, the strongest growth since 2014.
Overall GDP growth was below an official forecast of 0.9% and the oil sector shrank by 3.6%, marking the Saudi economy's worst performance since it contracted in 2017.
Expansion of the non-oil sector was mainly driven by growth in the private sector, which amounted to 3.8%, said the statistics authority.
""Non-oil activities continued to strengthen supported by high investment activity,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
In 2019, financial, insurance and business services, as well as retail trade and restaurants and hotels, were among the activities that saw the strongest growth - reflecting the government's investment drive into areas such as tourism and entertainment.
The energy and manufacturing sectors shrank.
Saudi exports fell by 10.4% year on year, because of a 14% drop in oil exports, the data showed.
Saudi Arabia's central bank governor, Ahmed al-Kholifey, said last month the non-oil sector will support overall economic growth in 2020, despite a challenging economic backdrop, further weakened by the global spread of the coronavirus.
Last week, Saudi Arabia - which has not reported any cases of the new virus - closed its borders to foreign ""umrah"" pilgrims and to tourists from at least 25 countries where the new coronavirus has been found.
Pilgrimage is an important revenue source for the kingdom, which has Islam’s two holiest sites in Mecca and Medina, and is the backbone of plans to expand visitor numbers under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious economic reform agenda.
Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the effects on the Saudi economy of the travel restrictions could be ""substantial,"" with the tourism sector accounting for 10% of Saudi gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.
""The hit to the economy from these travel restrictions, combined with the lingering threat of fresh oil output cuts, means that the risks to our forecasts lie firmly to the downside,” he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports snapped a 14-month losing streak in February thanks to more working days this year compared to last, although evidence of disruptions from the coronavirus were reflected outside the headline figures. 
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, provides an early guide to the health of global trade already taking a hit from the epidemic. 
Overall shipments in February rose 4.5% year-on-year, trade ministry data showed on Sunday, beating a median forecast of a 3.4% rise, given 3.5 more working days from a year earlier. This compares with a 6.3% decline in January due to the Lunar New Year, a holiday which fell in February last year. 
Average exports per working day, however, tumbled 11.7%, the steepest decline in three months, and a big swing from a 4.6% increase in January. 
Exports to China dropped 6.6% from a year earlier, after falling 3.7% for the Feb. 1-20 period, but average exports to China per working day plunged 21.1%, the ministry said.
This follows data on Saturday that showed factory activity in China contracted at its fastest ever in February, even worse than during the global financial crisis of 2008. 
""Per-day exports were seen subdued especially in the second half of February,"" said Lee Sang-jae, chief economist at Eugene Investment & Securities, noting that it's not over. 
""If the decline in February was mainly driven by sapping Chinese demand, exports would fall even worse in March and April as negative perceptions over Made-in-Korea products spread,"" he said. 
But a rise in chip demand and prices, and increased sales to other countries including the United States, were expected to partially negate impact from the coronavirus.
A breakdown of the South Korea trade data showed February's overseas sales of memory chips and car components rose 9.4% and 10.0%, respectively, from a year earlier.
WORSE TO COME
South Korea on Sunday reported 376 new infections, raising its tally to more than 3,500, the highest outside China. On Saturday, South Korea recorded its biggest daily jump in cases so far. 
""Economic impact from the spread of the coronavirus is expected to be greater than in SARS,"" said Sung Yoon-mo, the South Korean industry minister, adding that he expects further economic consequence in March. 
Economists are also concerned over whether temporary factory shutdowns at major companies will further weigh on Asia's fourth-largest economy. 
""Worse is yet to come if major exporting companies start shutting down their factories temporarily in the wake of the spike in domestic infections,"" Meritz Securities' chief economist, Lee Seung-hoon, said.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) suspended operations at one of its factories after a worker tested positive for the virus, and  LG Display  (KS:034220) has shut a display module plant for disinfection work until Tuesday. 
A survey from the central bank showed business sentiment suffered its worst fall in nearly 17 years, even before the spike in national infections. 
Global investment banks now see South Korea's economy growing at a slower pace than last year's 2.0%. 
Last week, the Bank of Korea kept interest rates unchanged, while raising the ceiling for its special loans programme to 30 trillion won ($25 billion) to extend support for sectors hit by the virus. 

The finance ministry said on Friday a supplementary budget due next week to cushion the economic hit of the coronavirus will be larger than the 11.6 trillion won package spent during the 2015 MERS outbreak.

1153,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 29, 2020 04:16AM ET</span>",China data portends more punishment for bruised stock markets,"By David Randall, Lewis Krauskopf and April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets should fall further on Monday after a record contraction in China's manufacturing and service sectors because of the coronavirus outbreak, illustrating the massive potential economic impacts of the epidemic for the rest of the globe.
The outbreak has already caused massive disruptions in industry, led U.S. equities to suffer their worst weekly selloff since the financial crisis and knocked trillions off the market value of global stocks.
The first proper glimpse of how much economic damage the outbreak has inflicted so far came from China, the world's second-largest economy where the epidemic began.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a widely-watched measure of economic activity, fell to a record low in February, data showed on Saturday, with a worrying collapse in domestic and export orders and a contraction of the country's burgeoning service sector.
Investors believe the next few days will reveal whether the outbreak is accelerating in the United States, the world's biggest economy, how much the U.S. government is prepared to deal with an epidemic, and the economic damage in other countries. 
""Right now the market is saying that this is unbounded. We don't know what the limits are and we don't know where it's going to peak,"" said Graham Tanaka, chief investment officer at New York-based Tanaka Capital.
Stock markets globally lost about $5 trillion of value last week, as measured by the MSCI all-country index (MIWD00000PUS) that comprises stocks across 23 developed and 26 emerging markets.
The S&P 500 (SPX) shed 11% last week, entering correction territory, while the Dow (DJI) and the Nasdaq (IXIC) also registered their deepest weekly percentage losses since October 2008.
(GRAPHIC - Virus wipes out trillions off world stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2546/2514/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
The February China PMI readings are the first snapshot of the economy's state since the start of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed almost 3,000 people in mainland China and infected about 80,000.
The data indicates the economic disruption from the virus could extend to the whole first quarter of 2020 since the outbreak has caused widespread transport curbs and required tough public health measures that have paralyzed economic activity.
Capital Economics estimates China's economy would contract outright in year-on-year terms this quarter, the first time since at least the 1990s.
""The worst China manufacturing PMI in history will shock the market on Monday,"" ING economists wrote.
""Covid-19 has not only stopped production but has also broken the supply chain of production,...."" they said.
Investors are looking to the United States, where the outbreak and efforts to prepare for its possible spread have become political during a presidential election year.
The White House has played down the crisis and described the high level of news coverage as a ploy to hurt President Donald Trump's efforts to secure a second term.
""The next line in the sand is if we see cases expand in the U.S.,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio manager and strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions.
Signs that Japan could cancel its 2020 Summer Olympics--after years of preparation and some $12 billion in investment--would be another unwelcome development, Janasiewicz said. 
The International Olympic Committee has said it is committed to holding the Games on schedule.
Tanaka, of Tanaka Capital, said he is closely watching the U.S. response, including whether the government has been able to secure more kits to test for the virus. 
He has trimmed his position in shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and sold all his energy sector holdings as crude prices plummeted. But he continues to hold airline stocks JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) and  Alaska Air  Group Inc (N:ALK) despite concerns about travel demand.
Others are looking to the government bond market, a popular destination for nervous investors. Yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note, which move inversely to prices, hit an all-time low Friday."
1154,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 29, 2020 01:34AM ET</span>",China February factory activity contracts at record pace as coronavirus bites,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China contracted at the fastest pace ever in February, even worse than during the global financial crisis, highlighting the colossal damage from the coronavirus outbreak on the world's second-largest economy.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a record low of 35.7 in February from 50.0 in January, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday, well below the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction. 
Analysts polled by Reuters expected the February PMI to come in at 46.0.
The sombre readings provide the first official snapshot of the Chinese economy's state since the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic which has killed almost 3,000 people in mainland China and infected about 80,000.
The data foreshadows that the economic disruption from the virus will likely extend to the whole first quarter of 2020 since the disease outbreak has caused widespread transport curbs and required tough public health measures that have paralyzed economic activity. 
""We expect year-on-year growth in all activity data to be negative in January-February as China's economy has been severely constrained since 23 January,"" said analysts at Nomura in a note after the data release, citing the extended Lunar New Year holiday and the slow resumption of businesses. 
Nomura now expects first-quarter growth to be 2% year-on-year while Capital Economics estimates China's economy would contract outright in year-on-year terms this quarter, the first time since at least the 1990s.
A sub-index of manufacturing production nosedived to 27.8 in February from January's 51.3 while a reading of new orders plunged to 29.3, down from 51.4 a month earlier. 
New export orders received by Chinese manufacturers also declined at the fastest pace in years, with the NBS warning of mounting pressure on exporters from delayed shipments and canceled orders.
Labour conditions remained tight amid travel restrictions with a sub-reading for employment falling to 31.8 from 47.5.
Analysts are warning the spread of the coronavirus to other countries will impact global supply chains and limit the recovery for Chinese manufacturers. 
""Even if labour shortages in China start to ease, some factories may run into problems resuming normal production if outbreaks in other countries mean they have trouble sourcing intermediate goods,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note on Friday. 
Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have warned of a pronounced impact on first-quarter global growth, with rising risks of extending into the second quarter. 
BACK TO WORK
Beijing has rolled out support measures to help businesses, especially small enterprises that are facing a cash crunch and are key employers.
""These measures...would further boost corporate confidence and accelerate the pace of business resumption. It is expected that March PMIs would show an improvement,"" Zhao Qinghe, a senior NBS statistician, said in a commentary, adding that production levels at large and mid-sized firms will rise to 90.8% by end-March.
Production at China's small- and medium-sized companies was just 32.8% of pre-suspension levels as of Wednesday, according to official data released on Thursday. Some firms that have restarted work are running below normal capacity.
China's government has called on businesses to resume as soon as possible but many migrant workers, especially in Hubei province which is the center of the outbreak, have not returned to work because of the quarantine rules and travel bans.
SERVICES FALL 
China's service sector activity also contracted by the most ever, with official non-manufacturing PMI dropping to 29.6, from 54.1 in January, a separate NBS survey showed.
The service sector now makes up a larger share of China's economy than at the time of the 2002/03 SARS coronavirus epidemic, accounting for about 60% of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
The transportation, tourism and catering sectors contracted sharply, with sub-readings below 20 in the official survey, as people avoid crowded areas on contagion fears. 

A sub-index of construction activity, a key economic driver that Beijing has hoped would prop up growth, plunged to 26.6 from 59.7 in January.

1155,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 03:34PM ET</span>","Cooling consumer spending, inflation put spotlight on Fed amid coronavirus","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed in January and could lose further momentum as the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak, which has sparked a stock market sell-off and revived fears of a recession, causes households to tighten their purse strings.
Other data on Friday showed the goods trade deficit contracted sharply last month as both imports and exports declined. While the narrowing goods trade deficit could be a boost to the calculation of gross domestic product, a lot depends on how the coronavirus unfolds in the United States.
The coronavirus epidemic, which has killed nearly 3,000 and infected at least 80,000 people, most of them in China, is viewed by financial markets as the catalyst that could interrupt the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sought to calm financial markets on Friday saying ""the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong."" Powell also acknowledged that ""the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" and said the U.S. central bank would ""use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.""
The Fed bank cut interest rates three times in 2019. Financial markets have fully priced in a 25 basis points rate cut at the Fed's March. 17-18 policy meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.
""Consumers shielded the economy from global headwinds for most of 2019 but they won't prove immune to the coronavirus outbreak,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Persistently low inflation bolsters the case for a Fed rate cut as soon as March given the sharp tightening in financial conditions.""
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month as unseasonably mild weather reduced demand for heating and undercut sales at clothing stores. Consumer spending shot up 0.4% in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending gaining 0.3% in January. While a separate report on Friday from the University of Michigan showed its consumer sentiment index increased to a near two-year high in February, it noted that a fifth of respondents mentioned the coronavirus in the final days of the survey in part because of the plunge in stock prices.
""With consumers often responding to changes in stock markets, some weakening in sentiment could be coming soon,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Still, consumer fundamentals remain healthy. Personal income jumped 0.6% in January, the most since February 2019, after gaining 0.1% in December. Income was boosted by the annual cost of living adjustment for social security recipients and other government welfare programs.
Wages rose 0.5% in January after gaining 0.1% in the prior month. Savings raced to $1.33 trillion last month, the highest since March 2019, from $1.26 trillion in December.
Wall Street's main indexes slipped into correction territory on Thursday and stocks extended their plunge on Friday, but pared losses after Powell's comments. U.S. Treasury prices rallied, sending the yield on the two-year note below 1% for the first time since 2016. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
TAME INFLATION
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index edged up 0.1% in January. The PCE price index was held back by a 0.7% drop in the cost of energy goods and services, offsetting a 0.3% gain in food prices.
The PCE price index increased 0.3% in December. In the 12 months through January, the PCE price index accelerated 1.7%. That was the biggest gain since December 2018 and reflected the drop of 2019's low readings from the calculation. The PCE price index advanced 1.5% year-on-year in December.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index ticked up 0.1% in January after rising 0.2% in December. That lifted the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.6% in January from 1.5% in December.
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It missed the central bank's 2% target every month in 2019.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending nudged up 0.1% in January after a similar gain in the prior month. That suggests consumer spending got off to a slow start in the first quarter after cooling considerably in the final three months of 2019. Consumer spending increased at a 1.7% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, stepping back from the July-September quarter's brisk 3.2% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter, matching the third quarter's pace.
The coronavirus epidemic prompted Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) early this week to cut its first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.2% rate. Growth estimates for the January-March quarter were already on the low side because Boeing (N:BA) suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX plane starting last month.
But the shrinking goods trade deficit could somewhat limit the downside to GDP growth. A third report on Friday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit contracted 4.6% to $65.5 billion in January. Goods imports tumbled 2.2% last month and exports dropped 1.0%. 
The department also reported retail inventories were unchanged in January after edging down 0.1% in the prior month. 
Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.3% last month after gaining 0.1% in December. Wholesale stocks fell 0.2% in January after declining 0.3% in December.
While the coronavirus is disrupting supply chains for manufacturing, some sections of the industry do not appear to be experiencing significant distress. 

The Chicago Purchasing Management Index rose 6.1 points in February to a reading of 49.0, the highest level since August 2019, a fourth report showed. The joint MNI Indicators and ISM-Chicago survey suggested a marginal impact on businesses in Chicago area from both the coronavirus and last month's signing of a ""Phase 1"" trade deal between the United States and China.

1156,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>",U.S. Personal Spending Slowed in January as Incomes Jumped,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. personal spending decelerated in January to a still-solid pace, suggesting momentum among American consumers eased somewhat at the start of the year ahead of the coronavirus concerns.
Personal spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy, rose 0.2% from the prior month after an upwardly revised 0.4% gain in December, Commerce Department data showed Friday that missed the median estimate in Bloomberg’s survey of economists. Personal income jumped 0.6%, the most in almost a year, on increases in employee compensation and social security benefit payments.
As businesses have pulled back on investment, consumption has become more crucial for growth, shouldering the weight of an economy already buffeted by trade uncertainty and the 737 Max grounding even before it confronted the virus outbreak.
New vehicles were the main driver of the rise in personal spending on goods, while services were supported by food and accommodation. That followed retail sales data out earlier this month that showed retail sales increased for a fourth-straight month. Still, the “control group” tracking underlying demand was unchanged.
The report comes as the rising virus death toll and cases spreading to new nations have sent stocks plunging. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg have cut estimates this month for first quarter economic growth to a 1.5% annualized pace from 1.7 seen in early January.
Adjusted for inflation, consumer purchases for goods and services saw a second-straight 0.1% gain from the previous month, missing projections for acceleration.
One element supporting consumer strength is higher incomes, as companies offer higher pay in order to attract and retain workers in a tight labor market. Disposable income also climbed 0.6%, the most since December 2018, following a 0.1% gain in the prior period.
The personal saving rate climbed to 7.9%, the most since April, from 7.5% the prior month.
The Federal Reserve’s preferred core gauge climbed 1.6% from a year earlier, missing forecasts and remaining shy of the Fed’s goal despite three interest-rate cuts last year. While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently called policy “appropriate,” investors now expect rate cuts amid concern of the impact of the coronavirus.
The broader personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Fed officially targets for 2% inflation, climbed 0.1% from the prior month and was up 1.7% from a year earlier, both missing estimates.
The core PCE index, which excludes food and energy, increased at a 1.585% annualized rate over the past three months compared with 1.551% in the three months through December. Policy makers view the core gauge as a better gauge of underlying price trends and have said they also aim for it to rise 2%."
1157,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",India’s Deepening Slowdown Faces Fresh Risks from Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s economy slowed to a more than six-year low in the final three months of last year, and it now faces a fresh threat from the coronavirus outbreak.
Data on Friday showed growth decelerated to 4.7% in the three months through December from a year ago, the third straight quarter of decline and matching the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. That was before the virus began spreading early this year, disrupting global supply chains as China shut factories and restricted the movement of people to contain the epidemic.
The slowdown was from a revised 5.1% growth witnessed in the previous three months and a far cry from the 8.1% expansion seen in the quarter to March 2018. The soft numbers came on the back of flagging investments and subdued consumption in the October to December quarter. That backed a growing view that a recovery will be uneven, with a slew of high-frequency indicators showing consumption -- which accounts for 60% of gross domestic product -- is still weak.
The government retained its estimate of 5% GDP growth for the fiscal year through March, an 11-year low.
“Growth decelerated further in the last quarter of 2019 confirming our view that a bottom may not yet be in place,” said Priyanka Kishore, Singapore- based head of India and Southeast Asia Economics at Oxford Economics Ltd. “While there are some green shoots, patchy hard data points toward a fragile recovery, prone to downside risks.”
The coronavirus adds a new layer of complication. The World Bank sees global economic growth in the first half of 2020 likely falling short of the 2.5% pace it forecast for the full year amid supply disruptions of everything from automobile components to pharmaceutical ingredients.
India imports more than one-fifth of its total non-oil, non-gold goods from China, and production halts there pose downside risk to domestic manufacturing, economists said.
“Temporary price increases are likely to be accompanied by production delays if the pain spills over into the April-June quarter,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Singapore.
Even before the virus began spreading, surveys showed consumer spending was in the doldrums while business sentiment was frail with the economy still grappling with the aftermath of a shadow banking crisis that has crippled credit growth. Factory output contracted in two of the three months in the fourth quarter of 2019, data show.​
Former central bank governor Raghuram Rajan said politics is also holding back India’s economic potential. New Delhi has been gripped by sectarian violence this week, with dozens of people killed, as protests against a new citizenship law continue to polarize society.
“Unfortunately the current government, post a massive election win, has focused more on fulfilling its political and social agenda rather than paying attention to economics,” Rajan said in an interview on Bloomberg Television on Friday.
The enduring weakness in some sectors of the economy, along with the threat from the coronavirus have persuaded the Reserve Bank of India to keep the door open for more policy easing -- as inflation rose to 7.6% in January -- after cutting interest rates by 135 basis points last year. The virus may “impact tourist arrivals and global trade,” the RBI said at its most recent policy meeting in February.
The continued slowdown suggests the central bank’s rate-setting panel may well undertake another rate cut, Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA Ltd., said, adding that it depends on headline inflation easing considerably toward the 4% mark.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the government is ready to respond with measures to counter the effect the virus may have on domestic industry.
On Feb. 1, she unveiled a budget with modest steps to stimulate consumer demand in the form of changes to personal income tax rules. That, together with the lower corporate tax rates announced last year, are likely to have a lagged effect on growth and demand."

The ECB, which targets an inflation rate of just under 2%, has pushed its interest rates to record lows and resumed a 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying programme to counter the fallout of a global trade war on its exporters.
Four ECB policymakers played down the prospect of immediate action to counter the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic on Thursday, saying it was too early to gauge the long-term implications of the disease.
On Friday, ECB Governing Council member Vitas Vasiliauskas said the bank had a ""wait and see approach"" and was monitoring the impact of the virus on supply chains.
The euro zone's central bank has fallen short of its inflation target for years. The ECB has also launched a broad review of its policy with the possible aim of redefining its main goal and how to achieve it.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rose more than expected in January, providing some relief for policymakers amid heightened risks of a recession as the coronavirus outbreak in China disrupts supply chains and business activity.
The world's third-largest economy shrank at the fastest pace in almost six years in the December quarter as a nationwide tax hike hurt business and consumer spending and soft overseas demand hit exports.
Official data on Friday showed factory output rose 0.8% in January from the previous month, a faster expansion than the 0.2% gain in a Reuters forecast, and following a downwardly revised 1.2% rise in the previous month.
That offers some good news as policymakers face pressure to boost growth to offset the fallout from the coronavirus, which has disrupted economic activity in China.
Manufacturers across Japan rely heavily on customers in China, the world's second-biggest economy, to buy their products, especially the parts and equipments that are supplied to China's factory floor.
""Output activity (in Japan) will likely slow down until the spread of infection is over,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Although production in China has restarted following the Lunar New Year, it will take time for output ratios to recover.""
If infections can be contained, output should start picking up in April, said Minami. Under a worst-case scenario, that may not happen until summer.
A spokesperson from  Japan Display Inc  (T:6740) told Reuters while its main local panel plants were operating normally, the virus had affected some operations in China due to shortages of components and workers.
At Sharp Corp (T:6753), operating rates at panel-related plants in China have also been lowered by component and worker shortages, as well as disruptions to distribution networks, said a spokesman.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to gain 5.3% in February and slump 6.9% in March. The February forecast was based on companies' plans for the month as of Feb. 10, which means any output cuts due to the coronavirus after that date are not included in the forecast.
Production was lifted by a sharp increase in autos and other transport equipment, which offset a decrease in production machinery.
Inventories rose at their fastest pace in since March 2018, up 1.5% in January from the previous month, boosted by autos and production machinery.
UNEMPLOYMENT RISES
While the better-than-expected output eased some policymaker concerns, job market data on Friday was less positive.
Retail sales also dropped 0.4% in January, at a slower pace than expected by analysts.
Friday's data follows a string of weak indicators in recent weeks, including manufacturing and service sector activity gauges that showed the coronavirus outbreak has taken a toll on the economy.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 2.4% in January from 2.2% in December, and the jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 1.49 in January from 1.57 in the previous month, government data showed, although that was partly ascribed to a change in survey methodology.
""The rise in the unemployment rate coupled with a sharp fall in the job-to-applicant ratio last month suggests that the economic fallout from the sales tax hike has started to curb firms' demand for workers,"" Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said in a note."

Prices fell a revised 1.6% in December. January prices were 4.7% lower than the peak in May 2019.
Fears over the virus outbreak have clouded one of the world's most expensive property markets, but property agents said business recovered slightly this month after the lunar new year holiday, as sellers cut prices and buyers sought bargains.
While the volume is expected to remain low in the short term, agents do not expect a collapse in prices, given the strong pent-up demand and low interest rates.
Realtor Ricacorp lowered its forecast for the full year, saying prices would climb 3-5%, compared with its original forecast of a 10% rise.
The property sector has been relatively resilient compared with tourism and retail, which have been hit badly by the protests and the epidemic.
But some agents project no growth or a small decline, saying that could worsen when the recession-hit city's unemployment rate rises.

Though other data on Thursday suggested some stabilizing in business investment in January and the labor market remained solid, that failed to calm jittery investors. Wall Street's main indexes dropped for the sixth straight session and slid into correction territory. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note touched an all-time low for the third consecutive day.
""Markets are voting and saying they think the U.S. is on its way to recession,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""And frankly at this stage after the coronavirus-related slowdown in travel plans that has busted the global supply chain apart, it will be a miracle if we avoid a recession."" Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate, supported by a smaller import bill, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP. That was unrevised from last month's advance estimate and matched the growth pace logged in the July-September quarter. 
The economy grew by an unrevised 2.3% in 2019, the slowest annual growth in three years and missing the White House's 3% growth target for a second straight year. 
Financial markets see the coronavirus epidemic as the catalyst that could break the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11t year. This could hurt President Donald Trump who is seeking a second term in office in the Nov. 3 election. Trump on Wednesday assured Americans the risk from coronavirus remained ""very low,"" and said public health officials were preparing to do ""whatever we have to,"" to deal with the outbreak. 
The coronavirus has killed more than 2,000 people and infected at least 80,000 people, most of them in China. Money markets have boosted their bets on the prospect of more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times last year. The coronavirus outbreak will challenge the Fed's view to keeping monetary policy on hold at least through 2020.
Though there is so far no real evidence that the coronavirus epidemic is impacting the U.S. economy, economists expect the struggling manufacturing sector to take a hit through supply chain disruptions and exports. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has already warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first quarter and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected.
Pain for the services sector could come via the travel and tourism industry. The stock market sell-off if it persists could erode consumer confidence and hurt consumer spending, which is already slowing. Economists also worry that corporate profits could come under pressure and undercut the labor market, the economy's main pillar of support. 
Despite the unrevised reading to last quarter's GDP growth, which was in line with economists' expectations, consumer spending slowed more than previously reported. There were also downgrades to business investment and government spending, offseting upward revisions to investment in homebuilding and inventory accumulation. 
WEAK DOMESTIC DEMAND
Excluding trade, inventories and government spending, the economy grew at a 1.3% rate in the fourth quarter, the slowest in four years. This measure of domestic demand was previously reported to have risen at a 1.4% pace in the fourth quarter.
Business investment fell at a steeper 2.3% rate in the fourth quarter, instead of the previously reported 1.5% pace. It was the third straight quarterly decline and the longest such stretch since 2009. There were downward revisions last quarter to spending on equipment, mostly light trucks. 
Investment in intellectual property products like software was also downgraded, eclipsing upgrades to spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells. Business investment could, however, be stabilizing. 
A second report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 1.1% last month, the largest gain since January 2019.
But these tentative signs that the business investment downturn could be drawing to an end could prove temporary.
""At the beginning of 2020 the outlook for manufacturing was for a modest rebound from the softness that characterized 2019,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""However, the economic impacts of the virus may disrupt the nascent recovery.""
In addition to the coronavirus epidemic, Boeing's (N:BA) suspending of production of its troubled 737 MAX plane starting last month is expected to weigh on the factory sector. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Sunday cut its first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.2% annualized rate. Growth estimates for the January-March quarter were already on the low side because of Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years. 
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.7% pace in the fourth quarter, instead of the previously reported 1.8% rate. A strong rebound is unlikely, especially if the stock market rout spreads to the labor market. A separate report on Thursday showed applications for unemployment benefits increased 8,000 to 219,000 last week, though the underlying trend remained consistent with solid labor market conditions.

The decrease in imports in the fourth quarter, in part because of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, compressed the trade deficit. Trade added 1.53 percentage points to GDP growth, rather than the 1.48 percentage points reported last month. That was the most since the second quarter of 2009. Inventories rose at a $13.0 billion rate in the fourth quarter, instead of the $6.5 billion rate reported in January. Inventory investment sliced 0.98 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 1.1% last month, the largest gain since January 2019. There were increases in orders for machinery, primary metals, computers and electronics products. But demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell last month.
Data for December was revised up to show these so-called core capital goods orders falling 0.5% instead of declining 0.8% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders edging up 0.1% in January.
Core capital goods orders increased 1.4% on a year-on-year basis in January.
Shipments of core capital goods rebounded 1.1% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They fell by an upwardly revised 0.1% in December. They were previously reported to have slipped 0.3% in December.
The rebound in core capital goods orders and shipments at the start of the year likely suggests some stabilization in business investment, which has contracted for three straight quarters. The business investment slump has undercut manufacturing, which is facing supply chain disruptions from the corononavirus, especially for electronics producers like Apple. (O:AAPL)
Data firm IHS Markit said last Friday its flash Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the U.S. manufacturing and services sectors, contracted to a 76-month low in February.
The coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and spread to other countries, has caused a rout on Wall Street and stock markets around the globe. Money markets have increased their bets on the prospect of more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times last year and has signaled its intention to keep monetary policy on hold at least through 2020.
Capital expenditure has been undercut by the White House's 19-month trade war with China, which has hurt business confidence. A ""Phase 1"" trade deal signed between Washington and Beijing in January left the bulk of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in place. Manufacturing is also taking a hit from Boeing's (N:BA) decision to halt the production of its troubled 737 MAX plane starting last month.
In January, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, slipped 0.2% after surging 2.9% in the prior month. Durable goods orders were held down by a 2.2% drop in orders for transportation equipment, which followed an 8.8% jump in December.
Orders for civilian aircraft soared 346.2% last month after plunging 66.7% in December. This was despite Boeing reporting this month that it booked no new orders for airplanes in January, the first time it has come up empty-handed in January since 1962. It received only three commercial aircraft orders in December.
Motor vehicles and parts orders slipped 0.8% in January."
1166,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2020 08:38AM ET</span>",U.S. Fourth-Quarter GDP Revisions Show Weaker Underlying Demand,"(Bloomberg) -- Underlying demand in the U.S. economy was slower than initially reported at the end of last year, putting growth on a weaker footing ahead of risks from the coronavirus in 2020.
Upwardly revised contributions from trade and inventories kept gross domestic product expanding at a solid 2.1% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching estimates for no revision of the initially reported rate, Commerce Department data showed Thursday.
But consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of the economy, was revised down to a 1.7% increase from 1.8%, also matching forecasts. Nonresidential fixed investment was revised lower to a 2.3% drop, representing the third straight decrease and matching the biggest decline since 2015.
The report suggests the record-long U.S. expansion is more vulnerable to weakening than previously thought, and it may remain below President Donald Trump’s target of 3% growth as he seeks re-election. Global stocks have been walloped this week and Treasury yields have declined to record lows as the coronavirus spreads and investors fret about its impact on world commerce.
Earlier this month, economists had forecast that U.S. growth would slow to 1.5% in the first quarter, amid weaker gains in government spending and only a slight increase in private investment. The record-long expansion is reliant on consumers continuing to open their wallets, particularly as businesses already whipsawed by the U.S.-China trade war start to contend with the coronavirus.
While most U.S. data have yet to reflect an impact from the virus, some indicators point to a potential hit to GDP: An IHS Markit output gauge for February fell to the lowest since 2013, led by concern at factories and service providers about lower new orders and demand, and severed supply chains.
Brighter Data
Another data set from the Commerce Department on Thursday was brighter. Orders for commercial equipment excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- rose 1.1% in January after an upwardly revised 0.5% decrease. Even so, the coronavirus will test demand as well as supply chains.
A key measure of underlying demand -- final sales to domestic purchasers -- rose an annualized 1.5% in the fourth quarter, revised from an initially reported 1.6% and the weakest in a year.
Net exports contributed an upwardly revised 1.53 percentage points to fourth-quarter GDP growth, while inventories dragged down the headline figure by 0.98 point, less than initially reported.
A separate report from the Labor Department Thursday showed filings for unemployment benefits rose for a third week, though they remain low by historical standards. Jobless claims increased to 219,000 in the week ended Feb. 22, above economist forecasts. The four-week average, a less-volatile measure, edged up to 209,750.
The claims figures tend to be more volatile around holidays. Last week included the Presidents Day holiday.
The fourth-quarter GDP figures will be revised for a third and final time in March as additional data are compiled. GDP for the January-to-March period will be released in April."

Euro-area economic confidence unexpectedly increased this month, indicating the bloc was gaining momentum before Italy took a blow from the spread of the coronavirus.
The European Commission’s sentiment index rose for a fourth month in February, with improvements in industry, services and consumer optimism. While the results, along other reports, suggest a mild pickup after the economy’s weak end to 2019, they may not fully reflect the current state of affairs.
The virus outbreak that began in China is increasingly casting a pall over economic activity. With factories closed, air transport halted, and consumers confined to their homes, companies including Royal Philips NV and Danone have grown more downbeat on their outlook.
On Thursday,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) cut its forecast for global economic growth this year to 2.2% from 2.6%. It sees the euro zone expanding just 0.5%.
In Italy, the bloc’s third-largest economy, several towns in the wealthy, industrialized north are under quarantine due to the disease outbreak, and public events have been canceled.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Most analysts are assuming that the virus will be contained in 1Q. Taking the official numbers on falling new cases at face value that sounds plausible for China, though far from guaranteed. With outbreaks in Korea, Iran, Italy, and elsewhere, the global picture is even less certain.”

The Commission survey was conducted Feb. 3-20. It showed a second monthly gain in industry confidence, with a gauge for existing orders improving by the most in 2 1/2 years. Service providers expected demand to remain stable, while households’ economic expectations jumped.
Sentiment saw marked improvements in the Netherlands, France and Spain, as well as a small uptick in Germany.
Much will depend on how the spread of the coronavirus will impact confidence in the weeks ahead.

SYDNEY(Reuters) - Australian business investment unexpectedly fell last quarter led by declines in the mining and building sectors, frustrating hopes for a long-awaited pick up in spending and reinforcing expectations of yet another rate cut later this year.
During the December quarter, investment stumbled 2.8% to A$28.5 billion ($18.8 billion), figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Thursday. That was far from market forecasts for a 0.4% rise and followed a downwardly revised 0.4% fall in the September quarter.
Australian firms also seemed less confident about the future, with the first estimate for spending plans for 2020/21 at A$100.2 billion, below some analysts' forecasts of around A$120 billion.
""The capex survey disappointed again,"" said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics.
""All sectors recorded a drop, with the weak economic outlook appearing to dampen investment intentions.""
In one encouraging sign, however, spending on equipment and machinery climbed 0.8% and likely added to economic growth in the December quarter.
Moreover, the outlook for the mining sector was positive with increase in spending intentions this year as well as next year.
The final estimate for 2019/20 showed spending plans edged up modestly to A$120.3 billion, though intentions for the service sector cooled sharply for this year as well as next year.
""We continue to expect further monetary easing, and the pressure will mount on the government to loosen policy in its May budget,"" Hunter added.
The reluctance of businesses to invest is a global problem, blamed in part on the uncertainty generated by the protracted Sino-U.S. trade dispute last year and a rapidly spreading viral epidemic in China this year.
Figures due next week are likely to show Australia's A$2 trillion annual gross domestic product (GDP) expanded around 0.3% in the quarter, slowing from last quarter, though analysts had yet to finalise their forecasts.
Such a result would see annual growth tick up to 1.9%, a below trend outcome that could force the central bank's hand yet again.

Financial markets imply a 50-50 chance of an RBA cut to 0.5% by May. A second cut to 0.25% is 60% priced in by year-end.
RBA Governor Philip Lowe this month said he was worried about the slow pace of business investment across the country.
""I fear that our economy is becoming less dynamic,"" Lowe told a parliamentary economics committee.
""We're seeing lower rates of investment, lower rates of business formation, lower rates of people switching jobs, and in some areas lower rates of R&D expenditure. So right across those metrics it feels like we're becoming a bit less dynamic. I worry about that for the longer term.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's central bank kept interest rates unchanged on Thursday, dashing expectations for a cut, even as the rapid spread of the coronavirus in Asia's fourth-largest economy threatened to derail growth.
The Bank of Korea's policy board held the base rate steady at 1.25%, a decision that was predicted by only 10 of 26 economists surveyed by Reuters. The central bank cut rates in July and October last year.
A majority of economists had expected the BOK to cut rates to head off the impact of the virus.
Governor Lee Ju-yeol is due to hold a press conference at 0220 GMT, after the bank announces revised growth forecast and inflation outlook.
The Korean won sharply gained against the dollar after the rate decision while three-year treasury bond futures March contract fell, as a cut was priced in.
""A key difference today, compared to SARS and MERS epidemic, is that policy ammunition is relatively limited,"" said Ma Tieying, a DBS economist who sees at least one easing this year. Ma correctly predicted the BOK would stay on hold on Thursday.
""We think the BOK will still respond to the pandemic shock this time, but in a reactive rather than pre-emptive manner.""
One potential concern for policymakers is that further stimulus risks worsening Seoul's house price bubble and undermining financial stability.
The median apartment price in Seoul has shot up almost 50% since President Moon Jae-in took office in May 2017, December data showed.
A weakening won and capital outflow risks may also deter the BOK from cutting rates.
Those risks combined with South Korea's reliance on global trade leave policymakers in a bind.
South Korea has seen a massive spike in new coronavirus cases and now has more infections than any country outside China. The outbreak has kept consumers at home, weakened trade and fanned investor uncertainties.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Monday said a supplementary budget should be drawn up to cushion the virus's impact on the economy.
About a dozen brokerages from BofA Securities, Capital Economics to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) now see Asia's fourth-largest economy growing at a slower pace than last year's paltry 2.0%, which was the worst growth since the global financial crisis.
Exports to China, where the epidemic originated, shrank 3.7% in the first 20 days of February from a year earlier, portending worse to come over the next few months.
In a break from decades-old practice, Thursday's rate decision was announced via emails and text messages, not in the bank's press room, as authorities seek to contain the spread of coronavirus by limiting crowds."

Ireland has remained the European Union's fastest growing economy during three years of Brexit talks, but according to the survey's authors, many consumers are not seeing an improvement to their financial circumstances from the buoyant economy.
The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index was 85.2 in February, little changed from January's 85.5.
In October, when it seemed that the European Union and Britain could fail to reach agreement on the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the trading bloc, the index fell to a seven-year low of 69.5 with neighbouring Ireland particularly exposed.
The index hit a 17-year high of 110.4 in January 2018 before consumers really began to be spooked by the possibility of a disruptive Brexit - a version of which is still possible at the end year if a favourable trade deal cannot be reached.
""Brexit concerns likely explained a significant element of the subdued tone of Irish consumer sentiment readings in recent years,"" said Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Ireland.
""However, those worries don't fully explain the pronounced lack of any 'feelgood factor' among Irish consumers, an absence that might appear at odds with the sustained strength seen in key Irish economic indicators such as last week's buoyant jobs data for the final quarter of 2019.""
""It simply seems that progress at the level of the individual household from the conditions experienced through the 'austerity years' has fallen short of improvement heralded in much economic commentary,"" Hughes added, referencing Ireland's financial crisis of a decade ago."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong is expected to announce its largest budget deficit in at least a decade on Wednesday to cushion the shock of often-violent protests and the outbreak of a coronavirus on the recession-hit economy.
Carrie Lam, the Chinese-ruled city's leader, has already proposed measures worth HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion) to help small and medium-sized companies and low-income households cope with the health crisis.
Many companies in tourism and retailing are struggling to survive as a partial closure of the border reduces visitor arrivals to a trickle and keeps residents away from public areas.
Those measures came on top of other handouts totaling HK$35 billion announced in recent months to mitigate the impact of the protests, which saw activists and police clashing in shopping malls and in the financial district.
They were expected to push the 2019/20 budget into a deficit and ensure the gap widened in 2020/21, with more measures due to be announced on Wednesday. Hong Kong usually runs balanced budgets or surpluses, since its pegged currency system commits it to fiscal prudence.
Tommy Wu, senior economist at Oxford Economics, expects the fiscal deficit to be 1.2% of gross domestic product in 2019-20 and 2.6% of GDP in 2020-21.
""To pull the economy out of contraction, you need something that benefits everybody, like cash handouts, tax cuts,"" Wu said. ""Pushing forward infrastructure spending that can be done sooner rather than later would also help.""
ANZ analysts expect the government to propose a deficit of 4% of GDP for the coming year.
Final GDP data later on Wednesday is expected to confirm the economy has shrunk for three quarters. Preliminary data showed the economy contracted by 0.4% in October-December from the previous quarter, versus a revised 3.0% contraction in July-September.
On an annual basis, the economy shrank 2.9%, compared with a revised 2.8% fall in the third quarter. For all 2019, the economy contracted by 1.2%, its first annual decline since 2009.
The first quarter of 2020, when Hong Kong recorded its first coronavirus patients, is expected to be significantly worse. Analysts predict the coronavirus will cut 1 or 2 percentage points off first-quarter growth and the contraction for 2020 may be worse than last year's, depending on the government stimulus.
Carlos Casanova, economist for Asia Pacific at Coface, warned handouts are unlikely to boost consumption when residents aren't leaving their homes.
""One-offs and freebies are people pleasers ... they will not offer long-term benefits to growth,"" said Casanova, who changed his 2019/20 budget deficit forecast to 1.5% of GDP from 0.2% because of the coronavirus.
""We would rather see a continuation of targeted support for affected sectors, as well as better redistributive policies – social housing, healthcare, education – and value-added infrastructure investments,"" he said.

""Underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy — strong job growth, low inflation, low interest rates, continuation of a bull equities market and solid business confidence — all add up to a growing demand for productive equipment necessary to keep businesses expanding and profitable,"" ELFA's Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.3% in January, down from 77.1% in December.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, reported monthly confidence index of 58.7 in February, slightly easing from the January index reading of 59.9, ELFA said.

Mexico's current account deficit narrowed to $2.444 billion from $23.004 billion a year earlier, the central bank figures showed. It was the smallest deficit since 1995, when Mexico suffered a severe recession, the data showed.
The current account deficit was equivalent to 0.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), the smallest since Mexico ran a surplus in 1987, according to central bank data.
Aside from the January-March period, Mexico ran up current account surpluses in all remaining quarters as businesses reined in investment on plant and equipments, curbing the outflow of dollars from Latin America's second-biggest economy.
""These figures are consistent with an economy that isn't growing,"" said Benito Berber, chief Mexico economist for bank Natixis. ""When there's economic contraction you're obviously importing less,"" he added.
Mexican firms have been unsettled by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's economic policies, helping to push the country last year into its first recession in a decade.
At the same time, Mexico last year became the United States' biggest trade partner as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war with China put a major dent in U.S.-Chinese commerce.
A breakdown of the central bank's current account data showed that goods exports last year rose to $461.1 billion from $450.7 billion a year earlier. By contrast, goods imports slipped to $455.3 billion from $464.3 billion in 2018.
Mexico posted a current account surplus of $2.486 billion during the October-December period, the data showed."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence edged up in February, suggesting a steady pace of consumer spending that could support the economy despite growing fears over the fast-spreading coronavirus, which have roiled financial markets.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index ticked up to 130.7 this month from a downwardly revised 130.4 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast it edging up to 132.0 in February. 
The survey made no mention of the coronavirus and economists do not believe that the illness, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and spread to other countries, would hurt consumer confidence. They noted that consumer confidence remained strong even as trade tensions between Washington and Beijing weighed on business sentiment.
""Based on how stubbornly high it has been through trade war rhetoric and other shocks, even a pandemic might not have made much of a dent in consumer confidence,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""The main reason it is hanging at such lofty levels, strong hiring, isn't going away any time soon.""
The Conference Board survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, fell to 165.1 this month from 173.9 in January. But the expectations index increased to 107.8 this month from 101.4 in January.
The report follows a survey by data firm IHS Markit last Friday showing its flash Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the U.S. manufacturing and services sectors, contracted to a 76-month low in February. IHS Markit attributed the plunge in the index to below the 50 threshold to the coronavirus outbreak, which it said was hurting the travel and tourism industries as well as disrupting supply chains.
Strong consumer confidence suggests the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, could withstand disruptions from the coronavirus.
""On average, Americans are upbeat about the future with their expectations moving up sharply in February,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""If it holds up, this confidence consumers have about their future may help keep consumer spending on an even keel and right now the consumer is the economy with business investment down in the dumps."" 
STOCKS HAMMERED
Investors on Monday dumped stocks and bought U.S. Treasuries, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond its lowest level since 2016. The 30-year Treasury yield touched a record low at 1.813%. 
Money markets have deepened their bets on interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times last year and has signaled its intention to keep monetary policy on hold at least through this year. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Sunday cut its first-quarter gross domestic growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.2% annualized rate. Growth estimates for the January-March quarter were also already on the lower side because Boeing (N:BA) suspended production of it troubled 737 MAX plane starting last month. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the fourth quarter and 2.3% in 2019.
Stocks on Wall Street extended their decline on Tuesday. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher.
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, fell to 29.8 in February from 35.3 in January. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. 
That suggests the unemployment rate likely increased this month after rising one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% in January as more people entered the labor market.
The increase in the Conference Board's market differential fits in with sharp declines in job openings in November and December, which suggested a slowdown in employment growth. Still the labor market remains solid as highlighted by very low layoffs. 
A solid labor market is driving a moderate pace of consumer spending and is helping to soften the blow on the economy from a prolonged downturn in business investment.
A second report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index increased 2.9% from a year ago in December after rising 2.5% in November. 

Tight inventory is keeping home prices elevated. But the supply squeeze could ease as building permits and the number of homes under construction are at levels last seen nearly 13 years ago. Demand for housing is being driven by the labor market and lower mortgage rates.

The Conference Board’s reading increased to 130.7 from a downwardly revised 130.4 in January, according to data from the New York-based group Tuesday that fell short of estimates in Bloomberg’s survey of economists. The economic expectations measure climbed to a seven-month high that barely offset the weakest reading for the present situation in eight months.
Key Insights
The fourth straight gain indicates that consumers are still upbeat as the labor market remains robust. The composition of the report showed that buying plans for autos, homes and appliances all posted increases.The report showed 6.3% of respondents indicated they planned to buy a new vehicle in the next six months, while 2.4% said they aim to purchase a new home, both multi-year highs.The reading is in step with other confidence measures, which remained elevated in February. The University of Michigan’s survey rose to the highest level in almost two years, while pessimism among U.S. consumers fell to an almost 18-year low, according to Bloomberg’s Consumer Confidence Index.Official’s View
“Consumers continue to view current conditions quite favorably,” Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement. “Short-term expectations improved, and when coupled with solid employment growth, should be enough to continue to support spending and economic growth in the near term.”

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2020 03:51AM ET</span>",Falling exports bring German economy to standstill in fourth quarter,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Shrinking exports held back German economic activity in the fourth quarter of last year, detailed data showed on Tuesday, confirming that Europe's largest economy was stagnating even before the coronavirus outbreak began.
Germany's export-dependent manufacturers are being hit by a slowing world economy and increased business uncertainty linked to tariff disputes and Britain's exit from the European Union.
The Federal Statistics Office said exports fell by 0.2% in the fourth quarter from the third, which meant that net trade took off 0.6 percentage points from gross domestic product growth.
The trade outlook remains clouded as the coronavirus epidemic is adding another risk, Ifo President Clemens Fuest said. The Ifo index for export expectations fell in February, with car companies among the most pessimistic, Fuest added.
Gross investment - which includes construction - rose by 2.9% in the last quarter of the year, adding 0.6 percentage points to growth, the statistics office said.
State consumption added 0.1 percentage points to growth while private consumption, which has been a key pillar of support recently, made no contribution.
The Statistics Office confirmed that the German economy grew by 0.6% last year, the weakest expansion rate since the euro zone debt crisis in 2013.
For 2020, the government expects growth to pick up to 1.1%, helped mainly by a higher number of working days in a leap year. Adjusted for calendar effects, Berlin predicts 0.7% growth.
Andrew Kenningham, an analyst from Capital Economics, said the German economy would continue to stagnate during the first half of this year as global demand would remain weak and domestic investment was likely to drop.
The impact of the coronavirus on the German economy through disrupted supply chains or lower demand from China had been small so far, Kenningham noted.
""But the longer the disruption in China continues, the greater the risks. And the possibility of the virus spreading in Europe poses a new downside risk.""
China is Germany's most important trading partner, with car makers being especially dependent on both Chinese supply chains and demand from China."
1184,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 24, 2020 04:34AM ET</span>",German Business Sentiment Holds Up Against Virus Concerns,"(Bloomberg) --
The mood among German business hasn’t been dramatically shaken by the coronavirus outbreak, suggesting they see a short-term impact that won’t overly disrupt a pickup in 2019.
The closely watched Ifo confidence index unexpected rose this month, as did a measure of expectations. The increase comes as executives wait to see if authorities can get the outbreak under control before it does further damage to Chinese and global growth. Companies have already cut profit forecasts because of the epidemic, which has shut factories and curtailed demand.
The euro pared its decline on the news, and was little changed at $1.0841 as of 10:03 a.m. Frankfurt time.
European surveys of activity proved stronger than expected in February, indicating some resilience across the corporate world. Those readings were in stark contrast to numbers out of Asia, which showed weakness in a number of nations as well as a sharp contraction in Japanese manufacturing. Even in the U.S., a measure of business activity dropped to the lowest in six years.
But the Ifo survey may already be out of date. Stocks plunged Monday amid growing fears about the spread of the virus, and Italy locked down an area of 50,000 people near Milan.
The economic implications were a key topic global finance chiefs discussed this weekend at a meeting in Riyadh. While ministers and central bank governors are still working under the assumption that growth will rebound relatively quickly, they agreed on a “menu of policy options” to counter the emergency if needed.
The outbreak is proving a significant risk to the global economy and a setback to Europe’s recovery from a manufacturing recession.
Germany, the region’s largest economy, stagnated in the final three months of 2019, though it’s expected to return to growth this quarter. The statistics office will update its estimate for fourth-quarter GDP on Tuesday, along with details on consumer spending, exports and investment."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing and services sectors activity stalled in February amid growing concerns about the deadly coronavirus' impact on the economy, boosting investor demand for safe-haven assets like government bonds.
Despite the downbeat report from IHS Markit on Friday, the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, likely remains on track. Other timely data such as weekly claims for unemployment benefits have remained low. In addition, regional manufacturing surveys have been upbeat in February.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers ""expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,"" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 in China and infected thousands globally.
""It will inevitably raise fears about the underlying health of the economy,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. ""While we certainly wouldn’t rule out economic growth slowing further in the first quarter, we have a hard time believing the apparent message from the Markit PMI that the economy is on the brink of a recession.""
The IHS Markit flash services sector Purchasing Managers Index dropped to 49.4 this month, the lowest since October 2013 and signaling that a sector accounting for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy was in contraction for the first time since 2016. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 53, down slightly from January's final reading of 53.4. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.
The manufacturing sector barely escaped a slip into contraction, with the flash reading there at 50.8, the lowest since August and down from 51.9 in January. The flash Composite Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dropped to 49.6, the lowest in 76 months, from a reading of 53.3 in January. 
IHS Market attributed the deterioration in the PMIs to ""the coronavirus outbreak, manifesting itself in weakened demand across sectors such as travel and tourism, as well as via falling exports and supply chain disruptions."" The data firm also said businesses were cautious about spending because of worries about a broader economic slowdown and uncertainty ahead of U.S. presidential elections in November.
The PMI's readings were at odds with other flash surveys. IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone rose in February. Business conditions also improved in the United Kingdom.
U.S. Treasury prices rallied on the weak U.S. PMIs, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury government bond dropping to an all-time low. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. 
UNDERLYING HOUSING STRENGTH
The economy could draw some support from the housing market, which is being boosted by lower mortgage rates after the Fed cut interest rates three times last year and is expected to keep monetary policy unchanged at least through 2020.
In separate report on Friday the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales declined 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million units last month, held back by a dearth of houses on the market. But the supply squeeze is likely to ease as building permits and the number of homes under construction are at levels last seen nearly 13 years ago. 
Economists polled had forecast existing home sales falling 1.8% to a rate of 5.43 million units in January. Last month, existing home sales were unchanged in the Northeast and rose in the Midwest and the populous South. But sales tumbled in the West, the country's most expensive region.
Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, surged 9.6% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
The government reported on Wednesday that permits for future home construction jumped 9.2% in January to the highest level since March 2007. The inventory of homes under construction in January was the highest since February 2007.
""Expect housing investment to be a key factor in growth this quarter,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
According to the NAR, there 1.42 million previously owned homes on the market in January, down 10.7% from a year ago. That was the lowest January inventory since 1999. 
With supply dwindling, the median existing house price increased 6.8% from a year ago to $266,300 in January.
At January's sales pace, it would take 3.1 months to exhaust the current inventory, up from 3.0 months in December and down from 3.8 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 43 days, up from 41 days in December, but down from 49 days a year ago. Forty-two percent of homes sold in January were on the market for less than a month. 

First-time buyers accounted for 32% of sales last month, up from 31% in December and 29% a year ago.

The factory sector has been in a rut since last summer as uncertainty fostered by the Trump administration’s trade war with China took a toll on business investment.

The reading in a survey by IHS Markit comes a day after European Central Bank President Luis de Guindos said the bloc's relatively strong labor market and ultra-low interest rates are supporting growth.
“The expansion is being led by welcome resilience in the service sector but manufacturing is also showing encouraging signs of pulling out of the downturn that has plagued producers for over a year,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
In the report, a composite purchasing managers index edged up to 51.6 in February, signaling quarterly economic growth of about 0.2%. Manufacturing continued to shrink, even if at a slower pace.
The question is how long whether new risks such as the coronavirus outbreak will spark a new slump.
In one worrying development, inflows of new business into the services sector grew more slowly than in the previous two months. That could be linked to disruption from the disease to businesses such as travel and tourism.
In addition, a number of manufacturing companies are seeing their supply chains disrupted as factories in China shut.
ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane has warned the economy could experience a “pretty serious short-term hit” from the outbreak.
The full immediate impact “may not yet be apparent,” Williamson said. “In particular, the widespread delivery delays seen in February bode ill for production in March unless new deliveries can be secured.”

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses kept up a solid rate of growth in February as factories posted the fastest rise in output for 10 months, despite ripples from China's coronavirus outbreak affecting supply chains, a business survey showed on Friday.
The 'flash' early readings of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed the expansion of Britain's vast services sector slowed slightly this month, but this was canceled out by an unexpected upturn in manufacturing.
Britain's performance bettered the euro zone's for the second month running, as the PMI suggested the world's fifth-largest economy looked on track to grow around 0.2% in quarterly terms after it slowed to a crawl late last year.
The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services indexes, held steady at 53.3 in February, jointly the highest reading since September 2018 and beating the consensus forecast of 52.8 in a Reuters poll of economists.
The survey chimed with other gauges which show the economy has picked up since Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election victory in December, even though the level of the PMI remains below its long-run average.
""The recent return to growth signaled by the manufacturing and services PMIs provides a clear indication that the UK economy is no longer flat on its back,"" said Tim Moore, associate director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The manufacturing PMI rose to 51.9 in February from 50.0, its highest level since April and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll, although there were signs that the coronavirus outbreak might have an impact on production in Britain. 
""Manufacturers noted that abrupt shortages of components from China had reverberated through their supply chains and led to difficulties sourcing critical inputs,"" Moore said.
He cited a record deterioration in the PMI's gauge of suppliers' delivery times, meaning manufacturers were forced to wait much longer this month for the arrival of parts.
Delivery times increased more sharply than the previous record in September 2000, when British truck drivers blockaded petrol stations in protest at high fuel taxes.
The services PMI, which covers the bulk of British economic output, fell in February to 53.3 from 53.9, close to the Reuters poll forecast for a reading of 53.4.
""The latest survey ... revealed a solid upturn in the service economy, driven by improving domestic spending and a recovery in new business enquiries since the start of 2020,"" Moore said.

Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The euro zone economy managed to pick up some momentum again in February despite many companies having been disrupted in various ways by the coronavirus, which caused supply problems,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Demand remained relatively strong, suggesting there won't be a deterioration next month. The new business index held at January's seven-month high of 51.3.
Williamson said the survey was consistent with GDP growth of 0.2%, matching the projection in a Reuters poll published this week. [ECILT/EU]
The headline index was buoyed by a rise in the PMI for the bloc's dominant services industry to a forecast-beating 52.8 from 52.5.
With demand resilient, demonstrating some confidence, firms took on more workers, albeit at a slower rate than in January. The employment index dipped to 52.6 from 53.0.
While a manufacturing PMI held below the break-even mark, it continued its upwards march. It rose to 49.1 from 47.9, its highest level in a year and ahead of all forecasts in a Reuters poll.
An index measuring output, which feeds in to the composite PMI, rose to 48.4 from 48.0.
Most forward-looking indicators in the survey moved in the right direction, suggesting the manufacturing recovery was still on course and optimism remained elevated. The future output index only dipped to 57.9 from January's 17-month high of 59.8.

IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, edged down to 51.1 from 51.2 the previous month.
The reading beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts who had expected a drop to 50.8.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its composite flash purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to 51.9 points in February from 51.1 in January. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 51.0 points.
The rise was mainly due to an expansion in the dominant services sector, which offset a drop in manufacturing activity.
While transport strikes over pension reform gradually dissolved in the first weeks of January, manufacturers are now having to contend with the outbreak of coronavirus in China disrupting their supply chains.
The February flash PMI reading for the services sector stood at 52.6 points, up from 51.0 in January and well above economists' forecasts on average for 51.3.
Meanwhile, the manufacturing reading fell to 49.7 from 51.1, hitting its lowest level since July and markedly worse than the average forecast for 50.7.
PMI readings above 50.0 point to growth in activity while those below indicate a contraction.
The French economy unexpectedly shrank in the final quarter of last year as manufacturing output slumped in the face of the pension reform strikes, official data showed last month.
The PMI survey showed that French manufacturers saw new orders from abroad plunge to the lowest level since March 2019 and backlogs build up as the coronavirus outbreak hit supply chains around the world."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports to China slumped in the first 20 days of February and overall sales per working day tumbled, as a coronavirus outbreak disrupted global supply chains and threatened to put a choke hold on Asia's fourth-largest economy.
Exports to China, where the epidemic originated, shrank 3.7% from the same period a year earlier, customs data showed on Friday, portending worse to come over the next few months.
""Per-day exports to China probably was far worse"" in seasonally adjusted terms, a Korea Customs Service official said after the data was released.
The outbound shipments are being seen as a bellwether for world trade because South Korea is the first major exporting economy to release such data since the start of the epidemic.
Overseas sales in the first 20 days of February rose 12.4%. Standard Charted Korea economist Park Chong-hoon said the figure was flattered by there being three more working days in the period than last year due to the shifting Lunar New Year holiday.
Average exports-per working day contracted 9.3%, however, following a 3.2% fall seen for the first 10 days of February, as demand took a knock from the spreading coronavirus.
""We should really focus on average exports per working day,"" said Park. ""The outbreak of the virus significantly pulled down shipments out of Korea, and it will only worsen in the coming months.""
While shipments to China as well as Singapore contracted, exports soared 24.2% to the United States and 19.8% to Vietnam, as South Korean goods became substitutes for those made in China, analysts said.
A breakdown of the trade data showed overseas sales of memory chips and car components jumped 15.4% and 40.6% respectively. Exports of vessels, however, tumbled 29%.
SURGE IN NEW CASES
South Korea reported its first death from the virus and a surge in new cases on Thursday, spurring concerns about the virus spreading outside China.
Analysts expect the outbreak to hurt global growth, with South Korean manufacturers expecting delivery bottlenecks, production disruption and a downturn in consumer spending.
President Moon Jae-in on Friday said measures to head off the impact of the coronavirus will be announced by the end of this month as the economy is an ""emergency"" situation.
The Seoul city government banned rallies and closed Shinchenji church services - which suffered a spike in coronavirus cases - as Korea reported another 52 confirmed cases, taking the national total to 156.
""This kind of surge in new cases poses a huge risk for Korean manufacturers. For example if there is an infected case among those working in the chip sector, that will lead to shuttering of factories,"" said Meritz Securities economist Lee Seung-hoon.
South Korean chipmaker  SK Hynix Inc  (KS:000660), the world's second-biggest maker of memory chips after compatriot  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930), on Thursday said 800 employees had quarantined themselves after a trainee had close contact with a virus patient in the city of Daegu, the epicenter of an outbreak in South Korea.
Meanwhile,  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said it plans to gradually increase local production due to a lack of parts from its China-based suppliers.

In Japan, factory activity suffered its steepest contraction in seven years in February, offering the clearest evidence yet of the epidemic's effects on Asia's trade-reliant economies.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 11:42AM ET</span>",U.S. labor market remains strong; manufacturing likely stabilizing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose modestly last week, suggesting sustained labor market strength that could help to support the economy amid risks from the coronavirus and weak business investment.
There was encouraging news on the struggling manufacturing sector, with other data on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a three-year high in February, likely as tensions in the 19-month trade war between the United States and China diminished. 
Washington and China signed a Phase 1 trade deal in January.
But the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and Boeing's suspension last month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes, continue to loom over the manufacturing sector.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers ""expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,"" but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus, which has also infected thousands globally.
""Manufacturing growth may be past its trough,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, looking ahead we continue to believe that activity will advance at a lackluster pace as global growth and trade policy headwinds are unlikely to significantly relent and the negative impact of the coronavirus will be felt via global supply chains interlinkages.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 210,000 for the week ended Feb. 15, the Labor Department said. Last week's increase in claims was in line with economists' expectations. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 209,000 last week.
The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of February's employment report. Claims fell 13,000 between the January and February survey weeks, suggesting solid job growth this month. 
The economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects.
HEALTHY PACE
Wednesday's Fed minutes showed policymakers ""judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong,"" and ""expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year."" Labor market momentum could slow this year, with job openings dropping to a two-year low in December. 
""Job market conditions may be softer at the margins, but layoffs remain quite low and employers remain generally content to maintain their existing payrolls,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index jumped to a reading of 36.7 in February, the highest since February 2017, from 17.0 in January.
The survey's measure of new orders received by factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, soared to 33.6 this month from a reading of 18.2 in January. While a measure of factory employment slipped, manufacturers increased hours for workers. 
The survey mirrored a report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showing a measure of business activity in New York state jumped to a nine-month high in February, though the outlook over the next six months remained subdued.
Despite the signs of improvement the risks for manufacturing, which makes up about 11% of the economy, are stacked to the downside. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years hurt industrial production in January.
The coronavirus outbreak is disrupting global supply chains. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) warned on Monday it was would likely miss its March quarter sales guidance set just three weeks ago because of the coronavirus epidemic, which is delaying reopening of factories in China after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break.
The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month business conditions index increased to a reading of 45.4 this month from 38.4 in January. Its six-month capital expenditures index fell to 29.8 from a reading of 32.9 in the prior month.

While manufacturers in the mid-Atlantic region reported receiving higher prices for their products in February, they paid less for inputs.

1196,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 09:03AM ET</span>",ECB Warned of Caution on Economy Even Before Coronavirus Hit,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank policy makers warned against signaling too much economic optimism at their January rate-setting meeting, a view that proved prescient now that the coronavirus outbreak is dashing hopes for an upturn any time soon.
The Jan 22-23 Governing Council meeting was held as trade tensions appeared to be easing -- with a first phase of a U.S.-China deal announced and some of the uncertainties around Brexit subsiding -- and economic indicators showed signs of stabilizing. While welcoming that data, officials worried that an upbeat tone could boost market interest rates and dampen the impact of their monetary stimulus.
“Although a more positive assessment of risks could foster confidence in the upswing and further support economic developments, it was cautioned that a more optimistic outlook for the economy needed to be communicated carefully,” according to the account of the meeting, published Thursday.
Coronavirus Will Weigh on First-Quarter Growth
Read Bloomberg Economics’ PMI preview...
Since then, economic reports have shown the euro area to still be stuck in a deep slump, and coronavirus is hitting supply chains by shutting down factories in China. The single currency has fallen out of favor with investors, dropping almost 4% against the dollar this year to the lowest in almost three years.
The ECB also warned of potential trade issues, saying the U.S.-China deal could cost the European Union some exports as a result of “trade diversion,” and noting that U.S. and EU still have unresolved tariff issues. While Britain’s departure from the EU was likely to go smoother after Prime Minister Boris Johnson‘s election victory, pending EU-U.K trade talks could result in more divergence than previously expected.
The Governing Council kept its stimulus unchanged at the meeting, which was mostly notable for its decision to launch the first review of strategy since 2003. That assessment, due to be complete by the end of the year, will study the inflation goal as well as the institution’s policy toolkit and communication. It’ll also examine how to aid the fight against climate change.
Policy makers repeated that they see a need to evaluate the impact of current stimulus -- negative interest rates and a bond-buying program that was resumed last year -- “in the light of the potential side effects.” Financial-stability risks in particular had to be “monitored closely,” they said.
ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane warned earlier this month that the euro-area economy could experience a “pretty serious short-term hit” from the coronavirus outbreak. The European Commission called the epidemic a “key downside risk” to its already subdued growth forecasts, and Germany’s Bundesbank said the nation’s exporters are likely to suffer.
Renewed concerns about euro-area economy have prompted market speculation the ECB may need to add fresh stimulus, if it has room. Lagarde has warned that a decade of crisis-fighting has left its arsenal “significantly” depleted, and urged governments to step up spending.
The ECB will present updated economic forecasts at the next policy meeting in March, and policy makers stressed that the strategy review “should not be perceived as constraining the Governing Council in its readiness to act by adjusting all of its instruments, as appropriate.”
Separately, the ECB announced that it made a profit of 2.4 billion euros ($2.6 billion) last year, an increase of 790 million euros, mainly due to returns on its holding of dollar-denominated assets and on the debt it buys under quantitative easing. The profit is distributed to national central banks, meaning it effectively goes to the region’s governments.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2020 08:28AM ET</span>",British shoppers and factories enjoy post-election bounce,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers started spending again early this year after a sluggish end to 2019 and industrial orders hit a six-month high, further signs that improved sentiment since December's election is translating into stronger economic activity.
Retail sales beat forecasts to rise by 0.9% in January after a 0.5% monthly decline in volumes in December, Britain's Office for National Statistics said on Thursday. 
The recovery was more marked if fuel sales are excluded, which can give a better picture of underlying demand. Sales on that basis rose 1.6% on the month, the most since May 2018 and above all forecasts in the Reuters poll.
Factories reported stronger order books for February as well, with a monthly survey by the Confederation of British Industry pointing to the biggest rise in six months, though they remained below their long-run average.
Consumer and business demand faltered in the latter part of 2019 as parliament deadlocked over Brexit, preventing Britain's economy from growing at all in the last quarter of 2019.
Following a snap election in December, Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to office with a comfortable majority. Business and consumer sentiment has improved since then, as Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 with an 11-month transition deal. 
The data supports the Bank of England's decision to leave interest rates unchanged last month, on expectations the economy will recover early this year. Sterling erased some earlier losses after the figures came out.
""The British consumer is a hardy beast and having weathered the pre-election uncertainty, we have charged back into the shops,"" Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments company Equals Group, said.
However, some economists were less sure the pick-up would last, with unusually wet weather and concerns about coronavirus expected to dent consumer demand this month.
SLOWER WAGES
Separate data earlier on Thursday showed employers had made the weakest annual pay offers in more than a year to staff during the three months to the end of January, and many economists predict Brexit uncertainties will re-emerge soon. 
Annual sales growth remained lackluster in January, up just 0.8% on the year after 0.9% annual growth in December, broadly in line with economists' forecasts.
Sales at petrol stations fell by 5.7% in January, the most since April 2012, which the ONS linked to higher fuel prices. Clothing sales grew by the most since May 2018 after several months of weakness. 
Looking at the three months to January as a whole, annual sales growth was the weakest since May 2013. Excluding fuel, sales did not grow at all between August and December, the weakest such run since comparable records began in 1996. 
Earlier in 2019, consumer demand had helped support growth, while businesses had put investment on hold until the course of Brexit became clearer.
Britain has now left the EU, and after the 11-month transition expires at the end of the year, customs checks and new tariffs on trade with the EU are likely.
""It's probably still too early to say whether we've seen the end of the slowdown in the sector,"" CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said after the improved orders data. 

""Notwithstanding improving optimism, the sector is still grappling with longer-term uncertainty over the UK's future relationship with the EU.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - New bank loans in China rose more than expected to a record high in January, as authorities step up support for an economy hit by trade tensions and facing a new threat from a fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak.
Chinese banks tend to front-load loans at the beginning of the year to get higher-quality customers and win market share.
Banks extended a record 3.34 trillion yuan ($476.42 billion) in new yuan loans in January, up from 1.14 trillion yuan in December and exceeding analyst expectations, according to data released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) on Thursday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 3.00 trillion yuan in January, compared with the prior record 3.23 trillion yuan a year earlier.
Household loans, mostly mortgages, fell to 634.1 billion yuan in January from 645.9 billion yuan in December, while corporate loans rocketed to 2.86 trillion yuan from 424.4 billion yuan, according to Reuters calculation based on central bank data.
Chinese regulators have been trying to boost bank lending and lower financing costs for over a year, especially for smaller and private companies which generate a sizeable share of the country's economic growth and jobs.
Growth in the world's second-biggest economy slowed to 6.1% in 2019, the weakest pace since 1990, as demand at home and abroad slowed in part due to the Sino-U.S. trade war.
On Thursday, the PBOC cut the benchmark lending rate - the loan prime rate (LPR), as the authorities move to lower financing costs for businesses and support an economy hit by the coronavirus epidemic.
Broad M2 money supply in January grew 8.4% from a year earlier, central bank data showed on Thursday, below estimates of 8.6% forecast in the Reuters poll. It rose 8.7% in December.
Outstanding yuan loans grew 12.1% from a year earlier compared with 12.3% growth in December. Analysts had expected 12.1% growth.
MORE POLICY STEPS EXPECTED
Policy sources have told Reuters the government plans to roll out more support measures as the coronavirus epidemic, which has killed more than 2,100 people and infected over 74,000, is expected to have a devastating impact on first-quarter growth.
Annual growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, stood at 10.7% in January, unchanged from in December.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In January, TSF jumped to 5.07 trillion yuan from 2.103 trillion yuan in December. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected January TSF of 4.3 trillion yuan."

The median annual pay rise offered to staff in the three months to January fell to 2.1% from 2.2% in the final quarter of 2019, its lowest since the last three months of 2018, human resources data provider XpertHR said.
""With January generally setting the tone for much of the rest of the year, we now expect employers to continue to exercise caution when making their pay awards, and for low pay awards to prevail over the coming months,"" XpertHR analyst Sheila Attwood said.
Pay settlements from large employers sometimes show where official wage data is headed, though the former typically grow more slowly as they do not include pay rises from promotions and job changes.
Britain's official rate of wage growth peaked at 4.0% in the three months to June 2019, but slowed to 2.9% in the final quarter of last year.
Job creation was strong over the period, but the economy as a whole stagnated."
1200,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>","Fed in No Hurry to Move from Sidelines, Minutes Show","By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers agreed that current stance on monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate ""for a time"" to sustain economic growth and support the pace of inflation, which continues to fall short of the central bank's target.
Minutes of the Fed’s Jan. 28-29 policy meeting, released on Wednesday, showed there was a firm consensus among members to keep rates on hold until there was a significant change to the U.S. economic outlook.
Fed policymakers said they expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace in the wake of easing trade uncertainties and signs of stabilization in global growth, according to the minutes. The outbreak of the coronavirus was flagged as a new risk to global growth outlook, which Fed members said warranted close watching at present, suggesting that the current pace of policy remains appropriate. 
""With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants viewed the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time ... to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective,"" the minutes showed. ""(T)here were some signs of stabilization in global growth, though uncertainties about the outlook remained, including those posed by the outbreak of the coronavirus.""
 
In recent weeks, worries about Covid-19's impact on global growth had sparked some hope the Fed could deliver a rate cut sooner rather than later.
 
But Chairman Jay Powell, earlier this month, quashed those hopes somewhat, saying it was ""too early"" to determine the economic impact from the virus.
""We know that there will be some — very likely be some — effects on the United States (from the coronavirus fallout),"" Powell said. ""I think it’s just too early to say. We have to resist the temptation to speculate on this.""
 
Still, investors continue to bet on a quarter-point rate cut in second half of the year, which is at odds with the Fed's dot plot released in December, showing that policymakers expect rates to remain on hold this year.
Traders see a 70% chance of a quarter-point cut by September, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.
In recent weeks, policymakers have continued to back the central bank's wait-and-see approach.
""It is my view that, based on my base-case outlook for the U.S. economy, the current setting of the federal funds rate at 1.5 to 1.75 percent is roughly appropriate,"" Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan wrote in an essay released Tuesday morning.
Data since the last meeting appears to support the Fed’s case to keep rates steady. 
January's employment report showed the economy generated a better-than-expected 225,000 new jobs last month, while the pace of inflation at 1.6%, continued to lag the Fed’s 2% target.
The introduction of an inflation range - as a tool to achieve the 2% target - has been floated at the Fed, but so far policy members appear reluctant to adopt the measure, citing potential communications challenges. 
At the meeting, Fed members discussed the use of an inflation range, but most participants expressed concern that ""introducing a symmetric inflation range around the 2% objective following an extended period of inflation mostly running somewhat below 2% could be misperceived as a signal that the Committee was comfortable with continued misses below its symmetric inflation objective,"" the minutes showed."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell less than expected in January while permits surged to a near 13-year high, pointing to sustained housing market strength that could help keep the longest economic expansion in history on track.
Other data on Wednesday showed producer prices increasing by the most in more than a year last month, boosted by rises in the cost of services such as healthcare and hotel accommodation. The reports could support the Federal Reserve's desire to keep interest rates unchanged at least through this year after lowering borrowing costs three times in 2019.
""The economy looks good with residential home building activity beating expectations and a little more producer price inflation, even if the data overstate how well the country is doing in terms of generating the growth and inflation the Federal Reserve wants to see,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.Housing starts dropped 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.567 million units last month, the Commerce Department said. That followed three straight monthly increases. 
Data for December was revised up to show homebuilding rising to a pace of 1.626 million units, the highest level since December 2006, instead of surging to a rate of 1.608 million units as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts falling to a pace of 1.425 million units in January. Housing starts jumped 21.4% on a year-on-year basis in January. An estimated 1.291 million housing units were started in 2019, up 3.3% compared to 2018. 
Building permits soared 9.2% to a rate of 1.551 million units in January, the highest level since March 2007, lifted by gains in both single- and multi-family housing segments. 
The housing market remains on solid footing, supported by the lowest mortgage rates in more than three years. Though housing accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, it has a giant footprint on the economy. Housing market stability could help to keep the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on course, amid risks from the coronavirus, slowing consumer spending and weak business investment.
Minutes of the Fed's Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers ""expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace.""
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 3.47%, the lowest since October 2016, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
""Housing is proving to be a solid link in a cooling economy,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hitting all-time highs as hopes that China would take more measures to prop up its economy eased worries about the impact of the coronavirus epidemic. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices slipped. 
PRODUCER PRICES RISE
A separate report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showed the producer price index for final demand jumped 0.5% last month, the largest gain since October 2018, after climbing 0.2% in December. In the 12 months through January, the PPI advanced 2.1%, the biggest increase since May, after rising 1.3% in December. Economists had forecast the PPI gaining 0.1% in January and rising 1.6% on a year-on-year basis. 
Data last week showed consumer prices excluding the volatile energy and food components picking up in January. That together with the firmer producer price readings led economists to expect a rise in the inflation measure tracked by the Fed for its 2% inflation target. Economists are forecasting that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 0.2% in January, which would lift the annual increase to 1.7%. 
The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in December. It undershot its target in 2019. January PCE price data will be published next Friday.
""This should raise Fed official confidence that underlying core PCE is running around 2.0%, limiting the potential for (rate) cuts on a low inflation concern,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Still, any 'significant, persistent' overshoot of 2.0% remains very unlikely, meaning rate hikes in 2020 are all-but-ruled-out."" 
The housing report from the Commerce Department showed single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, fell 5.9% to a rate of 1.010 million units in January. Single-family starts raced to a 1.073 million-unit pace in December, the highest level since June 2007. Single-family housing starts accelerated in the Northeast and West, but tumbled in the Midwest and the populous South. 
Single-family housing building permits rose 6.4% to a rate of 987,000 units in January, the highest level since June 2007. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment rose 0.7% to a rate of 557,000 units last month, with those for buildings with five or more units at levels last seen in July 1986. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes vaulted 14.6% to a rate of 564,000 units, and those for buildings with five or more units hit their highest level since June 2015.
While housing completions dropped 3.3% to a rate of 1.280 million units last month, the stock of homes under construction rose 1.3% to 1.203 million units, the highest level since February 2007. This could help alleviate a shortage of homes for sale that is keeping home prices elevated. 

Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.

The government last week reported a pickup in core consumer prices in January, which led economists to expect firmer readings in the inflation measure tracked by the Federal Reserve for its 2% inflation target.
Economists are forecasting that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index gained 0.2% in January, which would raise the annual increase to 1.7%, also as last year's weak readings are dropping out of the calculation.

The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates unchanged after reducing borrowing costs three times in 2019. The Fed is expected to keep monetary policy on hold at least through this year.
In January, wholesale energy prices fell 0.7% after jumping 1.5% in December. They were pulled down by a 1.5% drop in gasoline prices, which followed a 4.2% acceleration in December.
Goods prices edged up 0.1% last month after increasing 0.3% in December. Wholesale food prices gained 0.2% in January after falling 0.3% in the prior month. Core goods prices increased 0.3% last month. They gained 0.2% in December.

Russia’s exports to China dropped by almost a third in the first six weeks of the year as the spread of coronavirus sapped demand in the world’s second-biggest economy.
Exports dropped 21% to 620,000 tons year-on-year in January and halved to 118,000 tons in the first 10 days of February, the Izvestia newspaper reported Wednesday, citing data from the Far East unit of the Russian Customs Service. The biggest declines were in minerals, timber and other raw materials, the data show. The report didn’t include dollar values for the trade and the agency couldn’t immediately provide figures.
Russia is especially vulnerable to an extended shutdown in China because of President Vladimir Putin’s push to re-orient the economy eastward since the onslaught of Western sanctions in 2014. A possible dent in growth would come just as Putin is trying to boost spending to spur the economy after years of stagnation.
“A slowdown in the Chinese economy is a serious risk to Russian trade,” said Tatiana Evdokimova, chief Russia analyst at Nordea Bank in Moscow. “The longer activity in China remains reduced, the higher the risk of a considerable interruption in logistics chains and production that won’t be recuperated in following quarters.”
China is Russia’s biggest trading partner, with bilateral commerce totaling about $110 billion in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While the Russian economy has also been hit by a slump in global oil prices due to a drop in demand, the data don’t show a decrease in crude exports to China since the beginning of the year.
Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Kolychev played down the latest trade data in Moscow on Wednesday, telling reporters that bilateral trade is always lower in January due to Russia’s long New Year holidays.
How Fast Can China’s Economy Bounce Back from Virus Lockdown
The two countries share a 4,209 kilometer (2,615 miles) land border, which Russia shut down to passenger transport on Jan. 31, while allowing freight to continue.
Russian car manufacturer Kamaz PJSC gets about a 10th of its components from China, but re-distributed some orders to local producers, as well as suppliers in India and Belarus after the virus outbreak, according to spokesman Oleg Afanasiev. The company now has a stockpile that will last until the end of April, he said.
What Our Economists Say...
A big chunk of Russia’s economy depends on China directly or as a crucial link in supply chains. The stimulus that policy makers hoped would drive an acceleration in growth this year may now be needed to offset an extended slump in external demand.

Tourism revenues are also expected to suffer, especially after Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin ordered a temporary ban on Chinese travelers from Feb. 20. China is the biggest source of tourists to Russia, accounting for 1.5 million visitors in 2019.
“The recent Coronavirus outbreak may be an additional factor of uncertainty for inflation,” Dmitry Dolgin, ING Bank’s chief economist in Russia, said in a research note earlier this month. “Any news regarding a drop in supply of Chinese durables will also be a watch factor in the coming weeks.”"

The Monetary Policy Committee reduced its key rate for a sixth straight time on Wednesday to 10.75% from 11.25%. While most analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a cut, expectations ranged widely. The median forecast was for a reduction of half a percentage point, and a sizable minority predicted a hold.
The MPC left its guidance unchanged while adding a word of caution on Turkey’s lending boom. It also removed a mention of an improving outlook for inflation.
“Developments in credit growth and its composition are closely monitored for their impact on the external balance and inflation,” it said in a statement. “The central bank will continue to use all available instruments in the pursuit of price stability and financial stability objectives.”
Looking past market unease, Governor Murat Uysal is pushing Turkey’s inflation-adjusted rates further below zero at a time price pressures are intensifying. After weathering 13.25 percentage points of easing since July, the lira has grown more volatile and Turkey’s geopolitical entanglements are unsettling nerves among investors.
The latest move brings Turkey’s real rate to minus 1.4%, below such developed countries as the U.S., the U.K., Japan and Canada. Turkey’s currency has lost more than 3% against the dollar over the past month. It erased an earlier gain after the rate announcement and traded 0.3% weaker at 2:24 p.m. in Istanbul.
Rattled by the drop in the lira, Turkish authorities have made it more difficult for foreign investors to bet against the currency by cutting the amount of foreign-exchange swaps and derivatives deals that banks can carry out with non-residents. State banks have also been making a stand by flooding the market with dollars.
Interrupting the easing cycle carried risks for Uysal, whose predecessor was fired by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for not reducing rates fast enough. Contrary to the thinking of most economists and central banks, Erdogan believes lower borrowing costs are more effective at slowing prices and has repeatedly said that rates will drop into single digits this year.
“Despite interest rates falling, the exchange rate didn’t explode, inflation didn’t jump, markets didn’t get stirred up, nor was any other difficulty experienced,” state-run Anadolu Agency cited Erdogan as telling lawmakers last week.
Meanwhile, inflation accelerated faster than forecast for a second month, reaching 12.2% in January. The central bank expects price growth to stay elevated in the first quarter at around 11.5% before it starts decelerating and drops to single digits from the second half.
Uysal said the central bank expects to offer investors a positive real rate of return when taking the projected path of inflation into account. Its current forecast is for consumer price growth to slow to 8.2% by year-end.

U.K. inflation picked up for the first time in six months, boosted by the cost of energy, motor fuel and air fares.
Consumer prices rose a stronger-than-forecast 1.8% in January from a year earlier, the fastest since July, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. Core inflation picked up to 1.6%. The pound erased a modest decline and was up 0.1% to $1.3014 as of 9:35 a.m. London time.
But the acceleration is likely to prove temporary, with inflation expected to fall back in the second quarter and remain below the Bank of England’s 2% target for the next two years.
The benign inflation outlook would make it easier for the BOE to cut interest rates should the economy wobble amid critical trade talks with the European Union, though policy makers are expected to refrain for now. That’s because the labor market remains tight and confidence has improved since Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s election victory in December.
January’s inflation boost from gas and electricity was largely due to a sharp drop a year earlier when the industry regulator introduced its price cap. There was also upward pressure from auto fuel, which rose almost 2%, while air fares fell less than a year ago.
Other figures showed pipeline pressures remained relatively subdued, with output prices rising just 1.1% year-on-year.House prices rose an annual 2.2% in December, their strongest increase in more than a year, and surveys suggest the post-election revival in the housing market gathered pace in January. Prices in London, which have borne the brunt of Brexit uncertainty, posted the fastest growth since October 2017.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2020 04:11AM ET</span>",German exports to Britain slumped in run-up to Brexit,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports to Britain fell for the fourth year running in 2019, according to Statistical Office data seen by Reuters, as the weak pound dampened demand and uncertainty over post-Brexit trade regulations disrupted existing supply chains.
Exports to Germany's fifth-largest customer fell 4.2% to 78.7 billion euros ($85.00 billion), their lowest level since 2013, even as Germany's total exports rose 0.8% year-on-year to reach a record high.
""The main cause is the continuing uncertainty over the trade relationship after 2020, when the transition phase is over,"" said Martin Braml, a trade expert at the Ifo research institute.
Britain left the European Union at the end of January and has until the of the year to reach a bare-bones trade deal to replace the complete free flow of goods and services that Britain has enjoyed until now as a bloc member.
The future trade relationship is expected to disrupt many of the intricate cross-border supply chains upon which many industries, from automotive to aerospace, depend. A deal that would let that continue is widely thought to be unachievable in the 10 months remaining until the end of the transition phase.
Exports of cars, aircraft and aircraft parts, electronic equipment and pharmaceutical products had fallen, the data showed. Falls in trade within individual industries suggested that supply chains were already being dismantled.
""The best case in my view is that a customs agreement averts the worst fears (at the end of the transition), but we still won't have a deep and comprehensive trade agreement,"" Braml said."

Total foreign arrivals, which include tourism and business arrivals, declined 1.1% to 2.66 million from 2.69 million in the corresponding month last year, Japanese government data showed on Wednesday.
Arrivals from South Korea - which has been boycotting Japanese goods and services since a trade dispute ignited between the two countries last year, plunged 59% year-over-year, the Japan National Tourism Organization said.
The number of mainland Chinese visitors to Japan rose 23%, helped by a favorable comparison with 2019 when the Chinese New Year - a peak travel period - took place in February.
The Chinese New Year officially began this year on Jan. 25 - before China halted all tour groups to other countries due to the coronavirus on Jan. 27. The travel ban is likely to have a sharp impact on Japan's tourist arrivals from February."

A large part of the expected growth is due to four additional working days this year, with strong state consumption supporting the otherwise lackluster economy.
""More companies still expect business to be worse rather than better this year,"" said DIHK Managing Director Martin Wansleben, presenting the association's latest business sentiment survey of more than 26,000 firms.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy will grow at a much slower pace than previously forecast this year and much further below its potential, the central bank said in minutes of a meeting earlier this month when it cut interest rates to a record low.
Risks are increasing due to the coronavirus outbreak, delayed government spending, and an intensifying drought, according to the minutes of its Feb. 5 meeting, which were released on Wednesday.
At the meeting, the monetary policy committee (MPC) unanimously voted to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points to 1.00%, the third reduction in six months.
""The committee viewed that a more accommodative monetary policy stance would alleviate the negative impacts,"" the minutes said.
The MPC ""would stand ready to use policy tools as appropriate,"" the minutes said.
Thailand is the second most vulnerable economy to the virus outbreak after Hong Kong, with its strong reliance on China trade and Chinese tourists, analysts at Nomura say, adding they expect the MPC to cut rates again in the second quarter.
In December, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) predicted growth of 2.8% for this year, but it recently said it might be less than 2%.
It will next review monetary policy and provide updated economic projections on March 25.
BOT Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob previously said there was still policy room to help growth if necessary.
On Wednesday, Veerathai said it was too early to say whether the newly reduced policy rate was low enough for current conditions.
""That's because of the situation's dynamics, which need monitoring and assessing,"" he told reporters. ""Importantly, all sides will have to help.""
Thailand's trade-reliant economy grew just 2.4% last year, the weakest pace in five years, hurt by contracting exports amid global trade tensions, and sluggish investment.
Headline inflation in 2020 and 2021 was projected to be lower than the 1%-3% target range, the minutes said.
The committee remained concerned that the baht's value might not be consistent with economic fundamentals and would likely remain volatile despite its recent depreciation compared with trading partner currencies, they said.
The MPC said there was a need to closely monitor exchange rates and the effectiveness of the relaxation of rules to spur capital outflows.
The committee encouraged the BOT to consider implementing additional measures to stimulate investment and imports to reduce large current account surplus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders tumbled at their fastest pace since 2018 while exports posted a 14th straight month of decline as the world's third-largest economy grappled with the widening impact of the coronavirus outbreak and a recent sales tax hike.
Government data out on Wednesday showed exports fell 2.6% year-on-year in January, smaller than a 6.9% decrease expected by economists and dragged by U.S-bound shipments of cars and construction and mining machinery. It followed a 6.3% fall in December.
Separate data on Wednesday showed core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 12.5% month-on-month in December, bigger than a 9.0% drop seen by economists.
The data underscores the challenge Japan faces in overcoming external and domestic pressures, with little room left for policy maneuvering and the economy teetering on the edge of a recession.
While new year holidays in Japan and China were likely a bigger drag on exports in January than the virus, analysts expect China-bound shipments to weaken as the outbreak hits demand from February.
""The spreading new virus has prolonged the suspension of China's factory operations and declines in capacity utilization,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. ""That will cause ripple effects on Japanese exports from February.""
Ministry officials said they were not yet sure how the coronavirus had affected shipments to China.
TOURISM, SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS
Data on Monday showed the economy shrank the most since 2014 in the last quarter as domestic demand took a hit from an October tax hike.
The virus has killed more than 2,000 people in mainland China and already taken a toll on China's economy - Japan's largest trading partner - hampering supply chains for car manufacturers to smartphone makers and disrupting tourism.
In terms of volume, Japan's exports declined 1.6% year-on-year in January in a sixth straight month of decline.
By region, Japan's exports to China fell 6.4% in value year-on-year January, dragged down by chemicals, car parts and electronics parts.
Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, fell 3.2% year-on-year in January, marking the 15th straight month of decline.
U.S.-bound shipments, a key destination for Japanese cars and electronics, fell 7.7% in January, posting a sixth straight month of decline, led by a 18.5% fall in automobiles due to softening demand for passenger cars, the officials said.
Reflecting weak domestic demand, Japan's imports fell 3.6% year-on-year in January, versus the median estimate for a 1.3% decrease, dragged down by demand for liquefied natural gas, mobile phones from China and coal.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office forecast core orders, which exclude those for ships and electricity, to drop 5.2% in January-March after a 2.1% fall in the previous quarter, dashing policymakers' hope for domestic demand to offset weak exports.
In December, manufacturers' orders rose 4.3% as gains in electrical and general production machinery offset a drop in automobiles, while those from the service-sector fell 21.3%, dragged down by telecommunications and goods leasing."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign buying of Treasuries in 2019 hit their largest level in seven years, data from the U.S. Treasury Department showed on Tuesday, as Japanese and euro zone investors sought higher-yielding U.S. government debt in a world of negative interest rates.
Overall foreign inflows into U.S. Treasuries hit $6.696 trillion in December, up about $425 billion from a year earlier. That was the largest foreign inflow since 2012, data showed and analysts said.
Japanese investors bought $115 billion in U.S. Treasuries in 2019, while euro zone investors were net buyers of more than $100 billion, accounting for half of foreign buying last year.
""That's primarily yield-driven,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York. ""Japan and the euro zone were the big buyers -- two regions with negative interest rates and the need to add positive return to their portfolios.""
U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields ended 2019 at 1.91% (US10YT=RR).
Japan remains the largest non-U.S. holder of Treasuries at $1.154 trillion in December, and has been so since June last year.
China is the second largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, with $1.069 trillion, its lowest holdings since February 2017. China's holdings have declined for six straight months.
For 2019, China sold $54 billion in U.S. Treasuries.
Analysts said $54 billion was not a huge number, given that in 2016 China sold about $190 billion in U.S. Treasuries.
""Chinese holdings of Treasuries have been trending lower for most of the year,"" said TD's Goldberg. ""Perhaps they actually need the cash domestically for intervention purpose. But China's foreign exchange reserves have not been doing very much.""
On a monthly basis, net purchases of U.S. Treasuries hit $41.07 billion in December, the highest since August 2018, from sales of $39.597 billion in November. Prior to December's overseas inflows, the Treasury market had seen four straight months of selling since last August.
The report also showed foreigners bought $22.15 billion in U.S. stocks in December, from purchases of $8.5 billion the previous month.
They sold $18.45 billion in U.S. corporate bonds in December after buying $10.82 billion of them in November, according to the data."

In January, the average number of new home orders per community surged 34% to the highest level for the month since the housing recovery began in 2012, according to a survey by John Burns Real Estate Consulting.
The January surge comes after sales ticked up in the second half of 2019, peaking in November. The credit goes to job growth, consumer confidence, a strong stock market and, most importantly, a plunge in mortgage rates, according to Rick Palacios Jr., the firm’s director of research.
“We’ve never gone into a spring selling season with mortgage rates lower than they are now,” Palacios said. “That’s a big kick in the butt for customers who are thinking about buying and were putting it off.”
The property market is rebounding from a mini slump a year ago caused by a spike in borrowing costs. But after a softening of price growth and the drop in rates, sales offices are busy again. In Southern (NYSE:SO) California, which was especially weak a year ago, sales contracts doubled from the previous January, according to the survey.
In addition to low mortgage rates, new homes are getting a boost because the market for existing houses is so tight, according to Sheryl Palmer, chief executive officer of homebuilder Taylor Morrison Home Corp. Last month, the company’s orders jumped 46% compared with a year earlier.
The January sales numbers were particularly noteworthy because purchases typically don’t start picking up until later in the month, she said. In 2020, the market took off immediately after the new year.
“The unique part of this January is that it happened on Jan. 2,” she said. “Normally, things start building in the second or third week.”"

Investors have been plunged back into a gloomy mood over the German economy on concern the coronavirus outbreak in China will disrupt global trade.
ZEW’s index of expectations for the next six months decreased to 8.7 in February, below even the most pessimistic estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The poll suggests confidence is fading that Europe’s largest economy can stem a manufacturing recession that has lasted more than a year.
“Economic development is rather fragile at the moment,” ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. The outlook for export-intensive sectors has deteriorated “particularly sharply” as a result of the epidemic, he said.
The Bundesbank said on Monday there are currently no signs that growth momentum in Europe’s largest economy will pick up in the current quarter after flatlining at the end of 2019.
It described the deadly virus as a “cyclical downside risk” for Germany and its companies, for whom China is an important market and an integral part of manufacturing supply chains. Still, domestic demand and construction should continue to support the economy for now, the Bundesbank said.
Expectations for the wider euro area also worsened, the ZEW report showed. Last week, European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane said the region’s economy could experience a “pretty serious short-term hit.”
While this month’s survey didn’t feature a specific question on effects of the coronavirus, the Mannheim-based ZEW institute plans to ask about it next month. The survey took place from Feb. 10-17."

Hikes in prices at restaurants and hotels, education, and healthcare, boosted the index, data from the General Authority for Statistics showed.
Prices for food and beverages, which account for nearly 20% of the index basket, rose 2.2%, while prices for housing and utilities, which account for around 25% of the basket, decreased 3.3% - a lower deflationary pace than in previous months.
""This appears to reflect the recent bottoming out in the property market, which is feeding through into rents declining at a slower pace,"" Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics said in a note.
Prices receded in Saudi Arabia last year after rising in 2018 on the back of the introduction of a value added tax.
But higher government spending and an easing of austerity measures have given a boost to economic activity, which has recently started to translate into positive inflation, economists have said.
Saudi Arabia remains dominated by hydrocarbon revenues despite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify it. The economy grew a mere 0.4% last year, according to government forecasts, mainly because of a slowdown in its oil sector.
Tuvey said headline inflation could rise this year after Saudi oil giant Aramco (SE:2222) increased gasoline prices this month."

The number of people in work jumped by 180,000 to 32.934 million, at the top end of forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Full-time employment accounted for most of the growth while self-employment also rose strongly, the Office for National Statistics data showed.
Signs of weakness in Britain's labor market in the autumn prompted two Bank of England interest-rate setters to vote for a cut to borrowing costs.
But the BoE's other seven rate-setters have kept borrowing costs on hold amid signs that the economy picked up in early 2020 following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's sweeping election victory on Dec. 12.
The number of people out of work dropped by 16,000 to 1.290 million, the ONS data showed.
The unemployment rate of 3.8% remained at its joint lowest level since early 1975.
In another sign of confidence among employers about their hiring intentions, vacancies in the three months to January rose to 810,000, their highest since the three months to September 2019.
However, growth in pay has slowed steadily in months.
Total earnings growth including bonuses, rose by an annual 2.9%, the weakest increase since the three months to August 2018.
Excluding bonuses pay growth also slowed to 3.2%, its weakest increase since the third quarter of 2018.
Economists had expected total pay to grow by 3.0% and regular pay to grow by 3.3%.
""In real terms, regular earnings have finally risen above the level seen in early 2008, but pay including bonuses is still below its pre-downturn peak,"" ONS statistician Myrto Miltiadou said.
Many employers remain worried that uncertainty about Brexit will grow again in 2020 because Johnson has ruled out extending a Brexit transition beyond the end of the year, saying he will clinch a free trade deal with the European Union by then.
The data also showed Britain's productivity growth - the flipside of strong increases in jobs - remained weak at the end of last year.
Output per hour in the fourth quarter rose by 0.3% in quarterly and annual terms.
The year-on-year growth rate was the strongest since second quarter of 2018 but the ONS said the numbers did not represent a breakthrough.

The IHS Markit Household Finance Index jumped to 47.6 in February from 44.6 in January, the highest index reading since the survey began 11 years ago.
""Our latest Household Finance report signals a number of developments that should keep the Bank of England doves at bay and build optimism toward the UK's immediate economic prospects,"" Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
The BoE last month decided not to cut interest rates as it saw early signs of a recovery in the economy after a slowdown in late 2019.
BoE Governor Mark Carney told Reuters last week that there had been a bounce in business confidence and to ""some extent a firming of consumer confidence.""
Johnson's election victory ended uncertainty about whether Britain would leave the European Union on Jan. 31 and meant no political shift to the left under the opposition Labour Party.
The IHS Markit survey showed households expected a further slowing of inflation and a pick-up in house prices while worries about job security eased.
However, the proportion of respondents expecting a rate cut by the BoE rose to 27%, its highest since the last time the central bank cut borrowing costs in August 2016. The share expecting a rate hike in the next 12 months fell to 49% from 58% in Rightmove's January report.

1217,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 17, 2020 01:01AM ET</span>",Japan Recession Fears Grow on Virus Hit After Tax-Hike Blow,"(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world threatened by trade wars. Sign up here. 
Japan’s economy lurched toward a possible recession after taking another battering from a sales-tax hike in the last quarter that left it at a low ebb as the coronavirus outbreak hit activity at the start of 2020.
Japan’s gross domestic product shrank at an annualized pace of 6.3% from the previous quarter in the three months through December, the biggest slide since a previous tax increase in 2014, according to a preliminary estimate by the Cabinet Office Monday.
Economists surveyed had predicted a fall of 3.8%, flagging the adverse impact of the tax hike, weak global demand and typhoon disruption. The far worse-than-expected outcome showed that some of the government confidence in measures to cushion the blow of the tax hike was misplaced.
The result also raises the possibility that with the virus outbreak still spreading, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may have to consider another round of extra spending to support growth, little more than two months after his most recent stimulus package.
“I’m getting ready for another contraction in Japan’s first quarter. There just aren’t any positive factors to build a positive growth forecast,” said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities Co., flagging her view that the economy is likely falling into recession.
Iwashita expects the government to form another extra budget once it becomes clear the economy has stayed in a funk in the first quarter.
Japan Needs Fiscal Aid, not BOJ Help if Virus Hits Hard: Hamada
The Abe administration and the Bank of Japan had expected a smaller impact from the tax hike compared with the experience in 2014, when it buckled the economy by more than 7%. The tax increase this time was smaller, foods were exempted and the government deployed a raft of counter measures aimed at smoothing out fluctuations in demand.
But economists said some of the government steps, such as rebates on spending via cashless transactions, had limited impact as they didn’t appeal to an older segment of the population not used to mobile phone payment platforms. The figures laid bare the vulnerability of domestic consumption to sales tax hikes, according to Takashi Shiono, an economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
The latest data showed private consumption plunged by an annualized 11% in the quarter, as households slashed their purchases of cars, cosmetics and domestic appliances. In 2014 the hit was 18%.
Businesses also scaled back investment by 14%, preferring to wait for signs of a recovery from the tax shock before committing to further spending.
While the initial trade deal between the U.S. and China should have offered a tail wind for investment this quarter, the unexpected virus outbreak may instead amplify caution in the boardrooms of Japan Inc.
“Concern over the virus is only intensifying and the mood of self-restraint is going to spread more broadly. I’m becoming downbeat on Japan’s economy,” Shiono said.
The virus has already stopped the visits of hundreds of thousands of Chinese tourists to Japan at the beginning of Japan’s Olympic year, hitting an important source of spending revenue. The longer the outbreak disrupts production and domestic demand in Japan’s biggest trading partner, the more likely Japan’s exporters will suffer and parts supplies may dry up.
Japan Recession Risks Prompt Forecasts of 2020 Contraction
Government officials stuck to their line that the tax impact on the economy was smaller this time than in 2014, but hinted that more spending could be in the pipeline if a slump looked certain.
“We will keep paying careful attention to the virus’s effect on tourism and the wider economy,” said economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura in a statement. “According to the level of emergency, we will take necessary steps as needed in a flexible manner, and respond fully.”
Abe unveiled initial measures to counter the impact of the coronavirus last week, but so soon after releasing his economic package in December, he is likely to want to see harder evidence of a recession before mulling another large spending spree. Speaking in parliament on Monday he said the government would keep a close watch on the economic mpact of the sales tax and the virus.
While the BOJ has flagged its concern over the virus, it is also likely to emphasize the need for more data to assess the underlying trend. Given the growing side effects of its massive easing program and the relative stability of Japan’s currency, economists see additional action by the bank in the near future as unlikely.
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“Given the mounting risks to a rebound this quarter from the coronavirus, the government is likely to face growing pressure to add to already-hefty fiscal stimulus in the pipeline. A sharp drop in nominal GDP won’t sit easy with the Bank of Japan.”

Southeast Asia's largest economy had a trade deficit of $870 million in the first month of 2020, compared with a $270 million deficit expected in a Reuters poll and a revised deficit of $61.70 million in December.
Exports by value fell 3.71% in January from a year earlier to $13.41 billion, compared with a forecast rise of 1.19%.
Volatile prices of commodities such as copper and tin last month affected Indonesian trade, Suhariyanto, head of the statistics bureau told reporters. The stoppage of nickel ore exports was also a factor, he added.

The city’s unemployment rate is forecast to have risen to 3.4% in January, the highest level since 2016, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. With the economy in recession, the jobless rate steadily ticked higher through the second half of last year.
The latest reading also likely does not capture the full effects of escalating shutdowns from the coronavirus outbreak, which accelerated toward the end of the month.
Early indicators are hinting at more severe damage to come. Preliminary visitor arrivals data for February show average daily traffic to the city plummeted to fewer than 3,000 people, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. That’s an almost 99% decline from just shy of 200,000 a day during the same period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Hong Kong is facing “tsunami-like” shocks that can cause the unemployment rate to “deteriorate rapidly,” Financial Secretary Paul Chan said in a blog post Sunday. The growing economic pain may lead to a record budget deficit in the next fiscal year as the government pledges further stimulus to support battered industries, he said. Chan is expected to unveil his next budget on Feb. 26.

BEIJING (Reuters) - New home prices in China grew at their weakest pace in nearly two years in January as the economy slowed and a fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak brought the country's property market to a standstill.
Worryingly, analysts say the worst is yet to come for the property market, noting that with stepped-up measures to contain the spread of the epidemic, aggressive price-cutting by developers and widespread business disruption will be fully reflected only in coming months.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.2% in January from the previous month, lower than a 0.3% gain in December and marking the slowest pace since February 2018, Reuters calculated based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data on Monday.
On a year-on-year basis, home prices rose 6.3%, slowing from a 6.6% rise in December, hitting an 18-month-low.
Home sales have plummeted as the virus outbreak keeps property showrooms shut and potential buyers are afraid or unable to venture outside for long.
""Overall, the prices data have yet to reflect the impact from the coronavirus. There will be widespread price cutting in the country in February,"" said Zhang Dawei, a Beijing-based analyst with property consultancy Centaline in a note to clients.
Nearly 1,800 people have died from the virus in China and more than 70,000 have been infected, prompting widespread transport curbs and tough public health measures that are weighing heavily on activities from service sector to manufacturing.
Property developers and realtors are turning to virtual reality salesrooms, livestream marketing and generous incentives but the market has all but ground to a halt.
China  Evergrande  Group (HK:3333), the third-largest developer by sales in the country, said on Sunday that it will offer 25% discount for all properties on sales from Feb 18 to Feb 29.
Speculation is growing that more local governments and banks may relax restrictions on buyers and developers.
Wuxi, a tier-2 eastern city, relaxed requirements last week for developers applying for presales.
But most economists do not expect a broad easing in restrictions for fear it could boost already high household debt. China has clamped down on property speculation since 2016 to stop prices from overheating, but they had still risen for nearly 6 straight years.
SMALLER CITIES PRESSURED
Property prices had already been expected to cool this year before the outbreak as economic growth slowed. Real estate investment had hit a two-year low in December.
Analysts say the spread of the disease is expected to have a devastating impact on first-quarter growth in the world's second-biggest economy.
Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes, though the number was down to 47 from 50 in December.
Recent price trends have been mixed with some cities showing signs of rapid cooling with others at risk of overheating.
Wuhuan, the capital city of the central Hubei province and epicenter of the outbreak, saw monthly growth slowing to 0.4% in January, versus 0.9% in December.
Much of the slowdown in January came from smaller cities, while the biggest metropolises still saw stronger growth, according to the NBS.
January property sales by value reported by Chinese top 100 developers fell 12% from same period a year earlier, according to property researcher CRIC. The NBS will only release January-February combined official sales data in March.
""The required closure of sales offices of property developers may challenge their liquidity conditions amid rising debt repayment pressure and the cooling property sector, especially for those with high exposure to virus-affected regions,"" analysts with Nomura said in a note prior to the data release.

1222,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2020 09:03PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers remain pessimistic as coronavirus fears grow,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Worries about the spread of the coronavirus and its hit to the global economy kept Japanese manufacturers' mood gloomy in February, a Reuters poll found, even as firms shook off previous worries about the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's key tankan quarterly survey, found business confidence across the sectors remained weak over the next three months, as the coronavirus added to uncertainty over the global outlook and the October national sales tax hike.
The flu-like virus has killed more than 1,700 people in China, and it has already taken a toll on China's economy - Japan's largest trading partner - hampering supply chains for car manufacturers to smartphone makers and causing the number of Chinese shoppers to plunge in Japan.
It has also highlighted the vulnerability of the Japanese economy to external shocks just as worries have somewhat eased over the Sino-U.S. trade war and Britain's exit from the European Union.
On top of external woes, a sales tax hike in October dealt a blow to the consumer sector, which makes up the bulk of Japan's economic activity, dashing hopes that solid domestic demand would offset weak exports.
""Just as the domestic economy's slump following the sales tax hike is becoming evident, the coronavirus spread has made China-bound exports totally unclear,"" a manager of a chemicals firm wrote in the Reuters poll of 502 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 245 firms replied on condition of anonymity.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers stood at minus 5 in February, up a tad from minus 6 in the previous month. However, materials industries such as chemicals, steel, paper and pulp put a drag on the overall sentiment index.
The index has remained in negative territory - meaning pessimism outweighs optimism - for seven straight months.
The service-sector index inched up to plus 15 from plus 14 in January, but sentiment among retailers, information and communications weighed on overall business confidence, according to the survey conducted Jan. 30-Feb. 12.
Both manufacturers' and non-manufacturers' indexes are expected to stay unchanged in May.
The BOJ's December tankan showed big manufacturers' mood hit a near seven-year low in the fourth quarter as the trade war between the world's two largest economies lingered.
The world's third-largest economy shrank at the fastest pace in six years in the December quarter as domestic demand took a hit from the sales tax hike, underscoring the fragile nature of an economy teetering on the brink of a recession.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed further in January, with sales at clothing stores declining by the most since 2009, a trend that could raise concerns about the economy's ability to continue expanding at a moderate pace.
The economy's outlook was also dimmed by other data on Friday showing industrial production decreased for a second straight month in January as unseasonably mild weather depressed demand for utilities, and Boeing (N:BA) suspended production of it troubled 737 MAX plane. The reports prompted economists to predict weaker economic growth in the first quarter.
They followed on the heels of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks to lawmakers this week that the ""economy is in a very good place, performing well."" The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019.
""The soft patch for consumer spending entered its sixth month in January,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""With business investment spending still missing in action the economy will need a more buoyant consumer to register above-trend growth.""
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were unchanged last month. Data for December was revised down to show the so-called core retail sales rising 0.2% instead of jumping 0.5% as previously reported. Core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.3% last month. 
The unchanged reading in core retail sales suggested a further loss of momentum early in the first quarter after consumer spending grew at a 1.8% annualized rate in the October-December quarter. That was a step-back from the 3.2% pace logged in the third quarter.
The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, slowing from 2.9% in 2018. 
The slowdown in consumer spending, together with a deepening downturn in business investment and weak manufacturing cast a shadow on the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. The economy also facing risks from the deadly coronavirus, which has prompted economists to downgrade their growth estimates for the Chinese economy.
In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said industrial production fell 0.3% in January after decreasing 0.4% in December. Industrial output was pulled down by a 4.0% drop in utilities production. A 7.4% plunge in the production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment also weighed on industrial output last month.
U.S. stocks were mixed as investors digested the weak data and worried about the coronavirus epidemic's impact on the global economy. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BOEING DRAG
Boeing last month suspended production of the MAX plane, which has been grounded since last March following two deadly crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth.
Economists also expected the coronavirus to disrupt supply chains for manufacturers, especially electronic goods producers, though higher inventories at factories could soften some of the hit on industrial output.
""While U.S. supply chains are more integrated with China today than they were a few decades ago, inventories in the manufacturing sector are relatively high,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That said, it can often only take a single out-of- stock part to disrupt production. Therefore, we would expect production to remain fairly weak the next couple of months.""
In the wake of Friday's reports growth estimates for the January-March quarter ranged from as low as a 1.0% rate to as high as a 2.4% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter, lifted by an improvement in the trade balance as imports declined sharply. 
Consumer spending is slowing despite a strong labor market, which is steadily lifting wages. There is cautious optimism for some pick-up, with a third report on Friday showing the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased in early February. But higher consumer sentiment has not translated into robust spending in recent months.
In January, overall retail sales rose 0.3%, but data for December was revised down to show sales gaining 0.2% instead of climbing 0.3% as previously reported. 
Sales were lifted by a auto purchases, which rebounded 0.2% after slumping 1.7% in December. Receipts at service stations fell 0.5%. Sales at electronics and appliance stores decreased 0.5%. Sales at building material stores jumped 2.1%, the most since last August, after rising 1.3% in December. Sales were likely buoyed by unusually warmer temperatures, which have boosted activity in the construction sector.
Receipts at clothing stores dropped 3.1% last month, the most since March 2009. Clothing retailers have been struggling with plummeting mall traffic as consumers opt for online shopping. Macy's (N:M) announced this month plans to close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 corporate jobs.

Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.3%. That followed a 0.1% dip in December. Receipts at furniture stores rose 0.6%. Americans boosted spending at restaurants and bars, with sales increasing 1.2%. But they cut back on spending at health and personal care stores. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores edged up 0.1%.

1231,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 14, 2020 12:03AM ET</span>",Japan’s GDP Set for Biggest Hit Since 2014 Ahead of Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s economy likely suffered its biggest contraction since 2014 at the end of last year leaving it in a vulnerable state, as fallout from China’s viral outbreak threatens to turn a one-quarter-slump into a recession.
A sharp drop in consumer spending after a sales tax hike is seen as the main culprit behind an annualized 3.8% contraction estimated by economists. The slide would be the worst for Japan since the second quarter of 2014, when a previous tax increase prompted the economy to shrink by 7.4%.
Economists previously viewed the expected fourth-quarter contraction as a tax-triggered blip compounded by typhoons that battered manufacturers struggling with weak export demand. But analysts are now concerned the coronavirus could delay or even derail a weak recovery forecast for early this year, an outcome that policy makers would find difficult to ignore.
“Japan’s underlying economy isn’t on a firm footing to start with, so growth can be easily pushed into a negative territory if something like the coronavirus happens,” said Hiroshi Miyazaki, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Securities. He takes a far more pessimistic view than the consensus, forecasting a 7.5% decline.
Even before the virus started to threaten the outlook, Japan’s domestic economy was looking shakier than government officials and economists had expected.
Analysts’ forecasts have become progressively gloomier as it became clearer that shopping rebates and other government measures meant to maintain households’ spending after the tax hike hadn’t worked as well as hoped.
Economists estimate that consumer expenditure fell 7.8% in the fourth quarter, alongside declines in business investment and exports.
The full extent of the economy’s weakness may also be masked if higher inventories give the headline growth figure a temporary boost. That’s because higher stockpiles now will be a drag on growth later when they’re sold down.
While most economists still project Japan’s economy to eke out growth this quarter and avoid a recession, they are again revising down their projections amid concern the impact of the virus in China will hit Japan’s exports and also reduce tourists to Japan from the mainland.
Japan Needs Fiscal Aid, not BOJ Help if Virus Hits Hard, Says Abe Adviser
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe already took action in December to support the economy with a stimulus package that should lift growth as the year progresses. The prime minister also announced Thursday a limited raft of measures to help combat the impact from the viral outbreak, including loan guarantees for small businesses. He’ll likely want to see more evidence of economic damage before taking more extensive action.
The Bank of Japan is likely to hold off on using any more of its depleted policy ammunition to prop up growth, arguing that the special factors weighing on the economy are transitory.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. underlying consumer prices picked up in January, while the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits rose slightly last week, suggesting the economy was stable enough for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates on hold this year. 
The reports from the Labor Department on Thursday followed on the heels of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks to lawmakers this week that the ""economy is in a very good place, performing well."" Powell added that ""over the next few months, we expect inflation to move closer to 2%, as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation.""
The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady. It is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. 
""There is not no inflation out there and with unemployment claims remaining at low full-employment levels, inflation pressures will continue to build,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The consumer price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2% in January as Americans paid more for accommodation and apparel, after edging up 0.1% in December.
The so-called core CPI was up by an unrounded 0.2423% last month. Underlying inflation in January was also lifted by increases in the prices of airline tickets, healthcare, recreation and education. 
In the 12 months through January, the core CPI increased 2.3%, rising by the same margin for four straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI increasing 0.2% in January and gaining 2.2% year-on-year.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in December. It undershot its target in 2019. January PCE price data will be published later this month.
Last month's increase in the core CPI led economists to forecast that the core PCE price index gained 0.2% in January, which would raise the annual increase to 1.7%, also as last year's weak readings dropping out of the calculation.
""Fed rhetoric will likely embrace this move higher, while uneasily eyeing a reappearance of downside growth risks,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower as a sharp increase in the number of deaths and cases related to the coronavirus outbreak in China hurt investor sentiment.
TIGHTENING LABOR MARKET
Inflation is likely to be supported by a tightening labor market. In a second report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 205,000 for the week ended Feb. 8. 
Economists had forecast claims rising to 210,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, was unchanged at 212,000 last week. 
The government reported last week that the economy created 225,000 jobs in January after adding 147,000 positions in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor force, a sign of confidence in their job prospects.
Labor market strength is helping to sustain consumer spending, and supporting the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year. There are, however, risks from the coronavirus, which has prompted economists to downgrade their growth estimates for the Chinese economy.
While core inflation pushed higher in January, falling gasoline prices restrained the overall CPI, which nudged up 0.1% after increasing 0.2% for three straight months. In the 12 months through January, the CPI rose 2.5%, the biggest gain since October 2018, after advancing 2.3% in December.
In January, gasoline prices fell 1.6% after jumping 3.1% in December. Food prices gained 0.2%, matching December's increase. Food consumed at home ticked up 0.1%.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.3% after rising 0.2% for two consecutive months. The rent index rose 0.4% after climbing 0.3% in December.
Healthcare costs rose 0.2% last month after surging 0.5% in December. Apparel prices jumped 0.7% after increasing 0.1% in December. But new vehicle prices were unchanged in January after rebounding 0.1% in the prior month. Prices for used motor vehicles and trucks fell 1.2% after decreasing 0.4% in December.

There were decreases in the costs of motor vehicle insurance, household furnishings and operations, and prescription medication.

The Labor Department said on Thursday its consumer price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in December. The so-called core CPI was up by an unrounded 0.2423% last month.
Underlying inflation in January was also lifted by increases in the prices of airline tickets, healthcare, recreation and education. In the 12 months through January, the core CPI increased 2.3%, rising by the same margin for four straight months.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in December. It undershot its target in 2019. January PCE price data will be published later this month.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that the ""economy is in a very good place, performing well,"" adding ""over the next few months, we expect inflation to move closer to 2%, as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation.""
The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady. It is widely expected to keep monetary policy on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. Inflation is likely to remain tame amid moderate wage growth as the labor market works through slack that still remains.

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2020 03:36AM ET</span>",French unemployment fell to 11-year low in fourth quarter,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - French unemployment fell unexpectedly at the end of last year to an 11-year low, official data showed on Thursday, offering President Emmanuel Macron a boost on the economic front.
The unemployment rate fell to 8.1% in the final three months of last year from 8.5% in the third quarter, which was revised down from an initial reading of 8.6%, the INSEE statistics agency said.
The result brought the jobless rate to its lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2008. It far exceeded expectations for a rate of 8.5% on average in a Reuters poll of 11 economists, with none expecting anything lower than 8.4%.
The big drop will be a welcome development for Macron after weeks of strikes as trade unions put up fierce resistance to his planned overhaul of the state pension system.
""This is a clear success for France, and for the economic policy that we've been pursuing these last three years,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told broadcaster BFM TV.
The fall in unemployment comes even though the economy contracted slightly in the final quarter, which economists mainly put down to the strikes hitting manufacturers' supply chains.
Despite the weak finish to the year, the French economy last year outperformed other big euro zone economies like Germany because it has a smaller exposure to exports and thus the slowdown in global trade.
With demand at home firm, French companies have steadily added to staff numbers, also emboldened by labor code changes under Macron that have made hiring and firing easier.
INSEE said that not only did joblessness fall but the number of people in jobs rose in the fourth quarter to its highest level since comparable records began in 2003. 
The employment rate, which captures the share of people of working age who are in jobs, reached 65.9%. The jobless rate captures the number of people who are of working age and are actively seeking work.
The share of people on permanent labor contracts reached 49.3%. Along with the fourth quarter of 2018 when the same rate was reached, it was the highest since the third quarter of 2009.

The rate has risen since Macron's reform of the labor code, which economists say is because employers are less uneasy than in the past about putting people on permanent contracts that previously made it difficult to get rid of workers if business soured.

LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices rose at the fastest pace in nearly three years last month, according to a closely watched survey that adds to signs of a rebound in consumer sentiment since December's election lifted some Brexit uncertainty.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' (RICS) monthly house price index surged to +17 in January from -2 in December, its highest reading since May 2017 and above all forecasts from economists in a Reuters poll.
The growth was driven by a turnaround in London and southeast England, which had previously underperformed due to higher property purchase taxes and the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union in a disorderly way.
For the first time since February 2016, a majority of surveyors said prices in London were going up.
""It remains to be seen how long this newfound market momentum is sustained for, and political uncertainty may resurface towards the end of the year. But at this point in time contributors are optimistic,"" RICS chief economist, Simon Rubinsohn, said.
More widespread price rises were matched by an increase in the number of properties being listed for sale, which rose at the fastest rate since August 2013.
For the year ahead, there was the broadest expectation of price rises since January 2016.
Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 and is now in a no-change transition period until the end of 2020, after which trade with the EU will face border checks and potentially tariffs as well.
But the end of uncertainty over when Britain would leave the EU, and of the risk of a sharp leftward shift in government policy under defeated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, has lifted sentiment since Dec. 12's election.

A deep slump in euro-area industrial output at the end of last year highlights the scale of the challenge the sector will face in 2020.
The 2.1% drop -- the steepest in almost four years -- will raise doubts about a meaningful rebound in momentum. The economy barely expanded in the fourth quarter and the outlook at the start of the year has been dented by the coronavirus.
While some risks to the outlook diminished after the U.S. and China agreed a trade deal and the U.K. left the European Union without much disruption, the virus outbreak that started in China has pushed the world into a new crisis. Companies have shut factories, and warned of disruption to supply chains and a hit to their profits.
The European Central Bank is on high alert. Chief Economist Philip Lane has suggested there could be significant short-term effects for the economy, and President Christine Lagarde said policy makers are closely watching for any broader economic impact.
Some of the slump in industrial production in December could be due to temporary factors. France was hit by strikes and protests that months, while Germany’s plunge is partly linked to the impact of the holidays on construction.
Even though their next monetary-policy meeting is not for another four weeks, speculation has started that the Governing Council may at least consider easing policy to stimulate the economy. Even before the outbreak, the euro region was expected to only grow a meager 1.1% this year. The ECB will update that projection in March."

The Statistics Office said nominal wages climbed by 2.6% on the year in 2019 while consumer prices increased by 1.4%. That meant real wages rose by an average 1.2% in 2019 - slightly weaker than the 1.3% increase seen in 2018.
Rising wages, coupled with record high employment, have given the German economy, which traditionally relied on exports, a big boost in recent years.

“We assume the overall economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in New Zealand will be of a short duration, with most of the impacts in the first half of 2020,” the Reserve Bank said Wednesday after holding rates at 1%. “There is a risk that the impact will be larger and more persistent. Monetary policy has time to adjust if needed as more information becomes available.”
The RBNZ is juggling upbeat signals from a recovery in the housing market, a lift in inflation and falling unemployment against the risk of growth being curbed by a prolonged impact from the virus. The RBNZ trimmed its first-quarter growth forecast but raised its projections for the cash rate, suggesting it no longer sees a chance of further easing.
“We think the improvement in underlying economic conditions means the RBNZ’s easing cycle is now over,” said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore. “The bank emphasized that there was still time to cut rates to support the economy if needed at a later date. But for now, the impact of the coronavirus was expected to be short-lived.”
The New Zealand dollar jumped half a U.S. cent after the announcement. It bought 64.67 cents at 3:06 p.m. in Wellington. The yield on 10-year government bonds rose 11 basis points to 1.39%.
The RBNZ’s new projections show the average OCR falling no lower than 1% through 2020, and starting to increase from mid-2021. Previously, the track fell to 0.9% this year, implying some risk of a cut.
The monetary policy committee’s decision was reached by consensus, according to a record of the meeting also published Wednesday.
The RBNZ said employment is at or slightly above its maximum sustainable level while inflation is close to the 2% mid-point of its 1-3% target range.
“Low interest rates remain necessary to keep employment and inflation around target,” the bank said after keeping the official cash rate at a record low. “Economic growth is expected to accelerate over the second half of 2020 driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus, and the high terms of trade.”
While trimming its first-quarter growth forecast to 0.4% from 0.7%, the central bank revised subsequent quarters higher. It now sees growth in the year through March 2021 of 3.4% compared with 2.7% previously.
The bank’s economic outlook is more optimistic than many private-sector economists, some of whom predict the virus will cause a much sharper slowdown. ASB Bank this week forecast the economy could contract in the first three months of the year as the nation’s borders are shut to Chinese tourists during the peak season, and plant closures stem the flow of goods and services into China.
Still, a report last week showed the jobless rate fell to 4% in the fourth quarter, matching a decade low, and there are signs that inflation pressures are mounting.
The RBNZ expects inflation to reach 2.2% this quarter and remain around its 2% goal over the remainder of the forecast period.

The pace of expansion was well below the 4.2% rise forecast in a Reuters poll, and slower than 4.4% in the third quarter.

At its first meeting of the year, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) held the official cash rate (OCR) at 1.0%, taking comfort from a stabilizing economy after its 75 basis points of easing last year.
While the central bank flagged coronavirus risks, more upbeat comments about employment and consumer prices bolstered expectations it may not need to cut rates this year, which helped the New Zealand dollar climb 0.5% to $0.6440.
All economists polled by Reuters had tipped a hold in policy given domestic risks had receded but said the big unknown would be the hit from the coronavirus epidemic.
RBNZ said the overall economic effects of the outbreak in New Zealand would be of a short duration, with most of the impact likely in the first half of 2020.
""Nevertheless, some sectors are being significantly affected,"" RBNZ's monetary policy committee said in a statement accompanying the rates decision. ""There is a risk that the impact will be larger and more persistent. Monetary policy has time to adjust if needed as more information becomes available.""
Widespread global travel and work restrictions due to the coronavirus, which has so far killed more than 1,000 people and sparked a global health emergency, are putting the squeeze on New Zealand firms doing business in the world's second-biggest economy.
Meat, dairy, timber and seafood exporters in New Zealand have faced cancellations in China, which is its single-biggest export market.
New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that the coronavirus epidemic would have an inevitable impact on economic growth.
RBNZ said in its statement that economic growth is expected to accelerate over the second half of 2020 driven by monetary and fiscal stimulus, and the high terms of trade.
However, soft momentum in economic growth has continued into early 2020, it said.
""Overall, it looks like the RBNZ expects to keep the OCR on hold this year, unless coronavirus blows up into something severe for New Zealand,"" said Westpac New Zealand Chief Economist Dominick Stephens.
Australia's central bank held its cash rate last week and sounded doggedly optimistic even as markets bet devastating bushfires at home and China's virus would force aggressive easing.
The RBNZ's 75 basis point rate cuts last year helped it inch closer to its dual mandate of lifting inflation and increasing employment. Inflation in the previous quarter rose closer to the 2% midpoint of RBNZ's 1-3% target range, while the unemployment rate dropped.
Westpac has said New Zealand's first quarter gross domestic product would be 0.6 percentage points lower than previously thought due to the impact of the coronavirus, assuming a two month ban on travel and one month of disruption in China’s factories.
New Zealand's economy grew at a slightly below-expected 2.9% annual rate last year, as demand was partly hurt by the Sino-U.S. trade war."

Addressing lawmakers, Djerad blamed mismanagement and corruption during the past years for worsening financial problems in the OPEC-member nation, pledging to overcome the situation through reforms.
Algeria has been under financial pressure after a fall in energy earnings and foreign exchange reserves amid growing demands from the country's 43 million people to improve living standards.

Several senior officials and prominent businessmen have been jailed on corruption charges since the eruption of mass protests that ousted veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika who sought a fifth term in office.
""Our country has experienced catastrophic mismanagement in recent years which led to the squandering of its wealth,"" Djerad said. The government will carry out ""deep reforms to get the country out of this critical political and economic situation,"" he said.

(Reuters) - American households added $193 billion of debt in the fourth quarter, driven by a surge in mortgage loans, and overall debt levels rose to a new record at $14.15 trillion, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Tuesday.
Mortgage balances rose by $120 billion in the fourth quarter to $9.56 trillion, the New York Fed said in its quarterly report on household debt. Mortgage originations - pushed up by an increase in refinancing - also rose to $752 billion in the fourth quarter, reaching the highest volume since the fourth quarter of 2005, the report found.
Student loan balances grew by $10 billion in the fourth quarter, a slower pace when compared to five years ago. However, the total $1.51 trillion outstanding in student loan debt could be holding back young consumers trying to build up credit, the researchers found.
Credit card debt, which typically rises in the fourth quarter when consumers are doing their holiday shopping, rose by $46 billion last quarter, an amount economists said was larger than usual.
""Mortgage originations, including refinances, increased significantly in the final quarter of 2019, with auto loan originations also remaining at the brisk pace seen throughout the year,"" Wilbert Van Der Klaauw, senior vice president at the New York Fed, said in a statement. ""The data also show that transitions into delinquency among credit card borrowers have steadily risen since 2016, notably among younger borrowers.""
Graphic: Share of debt becoming seriously delinquent link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1987/1956/Pasted%20Image.jpg)
Some 2.36% of loans became more than 90 days delinquent in the fourth quarter, up from 2.27% in the third quarter. New foreclosures remained low by historical standards, with 71,000 notations added to credit reports between October and December.
However, delinquencies rose more substantially for credit cards, auto debt and student loans - with young borrowers seeing the biggest increase.
New York Fed economists said the rising delinquencies among borrowers in their 20s and 30s could be related to high levels of student loan debt, which could make it difficult for consumers to afford their bills.
""When the economy is strong you would typically not expect that unless they are changing the lending standards,"" Van Der Klaauw said in an interview. ""It could also be that the economy is very strong overall but there are some subgroups, and maybe young people in particular, who are not benefiting as much from that."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings dropped for a second straight month in December to hit their lowest level in two years, while hiring increased marginally, suggesting a recent acceleration in job growth was unlikely to be sustained.
The report from the Labor Department on Tuesday also showed a pick-up in layoffs at the end of the year. Though job openings remain relatively high, economists said the sharp declines at the end of 2019 were potentially warning signals for the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday struck an upbeat note on the economy and labor market, telling the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee that the economy was ""in a very good place, performing well.""
""Something is happening out there to the economy and while we can't be quite sure what it is, this collapse in the need for labor on the part of companies is not a positive development,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, decreased 364,000 to 6.4 million, the lowest reading since December 2017, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. The second straight monthly decline in job openings followed a 574,000 plunge in November, which was the biggest drop since August 2015.
Vacancies dropped by 14.9% in 2019. They peaked at 7.6 million in November 2018. Some economists said while the steep decline in job openings from the peak was concerning, they noted that vacancies continued to outpace the number of unemployed Americans, which was 5.9 million in January. 
""It is possible the decline in job openings represents in part better job matching, greater willingness of employers to hire and train workers, rather than a cautionary signal, but these data should be watched closely in upcoming months,"" said John Ryding, chief economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls surged by 225,000 jobs in January after increasing 147,000 in December. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.6% as more people entered the labor market, a sign of confidence in their job prospects.
The drop in job openings in December was concentrated in the private sector, which saw a 332,000 decline. The transportation, warehousing and utilities industry experienced an 88,000 decrease in vacancies in December. There were 34,000 fewer job openings in real estate, rental and leasing. The educational services sector also saw a decrease of 34,000 vacancies.
QUITS RATE STEADY
The job openings rate declined to a two-year low of 4.0% in December from 4.3% in November. Hiring rose to 5.9 million in December from 5.8 million in November. It was lifted by a 69,000 increase in hiring in the accommodation and food services industry. The hiring rate edged up to 3.9% in December from 3.8% in the prior month.
The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs slipped to 3.5 million from 3.6 million in November. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.3% for the fourth straight month. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence.
""We expect the labor market expansion to endure in 2020, but the pace of expansion will slow,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Risks are, however, stacked to the downside, at least in the near term due to the fallout from the coronavirus, problems in the aircraft industries, and the possibility of policy missteps, such as restrictions on trade.""
Layoffs increased to 1.9 million in December from 1.8 million in November. Layoffs increased in the arts,
entertainment and recreation sectors, and other services. They, however, fell in state and local government, excluding education, and the federal government.

The layoffs rate was unchanged at 1.2% in December.

1249,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 11, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>","U.S. Job Openings Fall to Two-Year Low, Capping Annual Drop","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. job openings unexpectedly slumped, falling to a two-year low in December, which could reflect weaker demand for hiring as an increasing share of the population joins the workforce.
The number of available positions decreased by 364,000 to 6.42 million, according to the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released Tuesday. That compares to the median forecast for a modest gain to 6.93 million. The quits rate held at 2.3% for a fourth month.
The second-straight monthly decrease capped the first annual decline since 2009. It was also the biggest two-month drop in percentage terms since 2009.
Key Insights
The decline in job openings may be a sign of softening hiring demand ahead, but other factors, such as a rising participation rate, may be at play. While the labor market remains strong by most measures, openings have pulled back from their record level in late 2018.The composition of the report showed that the decline in openings was broad based. Retail openings and manufacturing both fell to the lowest since mid-2017, while transportation sector openings fell to a two-year low.The decrease also spanned all four national regions, led by a 176,000 drop in the South, the biggest region.Total openings exceeded the number of unemployed Americans by 670,000, the narrowest since early 2018.Get More
Hiring climbed for a second month, to 5.91 million, as separations ticked up to 5.73 million.The JOLTS report lags a month behind the Labor Department’s jobs report, which showed U.S. hiring in January exceeded projections with 225,000 jobs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy flat-lined in the final three months of 2019, when the country was in a deadlock over Brexit that was only broken by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's December election victory, leading to some signs of a recovery early this year.
Official figures released on Tuesday showed zero growth in the fourth quarter compared with the third, matching the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
In annual terms, growth was 1.1%, stronger than the poll forecast of 0.8% after upward revisions to growth in some previous quarters. However, the last time annual growth was weaker for a calendar quarter was in mid-2012.
""This is a mucky figure with the true sense of the UK economy's performance occluded by the election of December 12,"" said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, chief economist at payments provider Equals Group. 
""More forward-looking data ... are more optimistic, and while outright optimism would be misplaced, upgrades to previous quarters are well received.""
The data also showed quarterly growth in household spending - which has helped drive Britain's economy for most of the period since the 2016 Brexit referendum - was the slowest in four years, rising by just 0.1%.
Business investment dropped 1.0% over the same period, the biggest fall since late 2016.
There have been previous signs that consumers reined in their spending in late 2019, and industry figures published earlier on Tuesday suggested only a modest increase in January.
However, companies have appeared more upbeat since Johnson's election victory, which lifted short-term uncertainty about whether Britain would leave the European Union at the end of January and ended the possibility of a sharp political shift to the left under the Labour Party.
Last month, the Bank of England held off from cutting interest rates as it saw signs of recovery in the economy.
The picture of the economy in late 2019 painted by the Office for National Statistics data on Tuesday was grim.
Manufacturing output fell in the October-December period by the most since the third quarter of 2013, down 2.5% from the same period a year earlier, reflecting car plant shutdowns in November, when Britain faced the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.
It is not only Brexit that has weighed on Britain's economy.
GDP in France and Italy shrank in the final three months of 2019 as the world economy felt the strain of trade tensions between the United States and China.
Britain's finance minister, Sajid Javid, is expected to give the country's economy a boost with a spending increase in the government's first post-Brexit budget on March 11.

The ONS said a surge in exports of gold linked to precious metals dealing in London led to a rare trade surplus for Britain in December. Excluding the gold distortion, the trade deficit in goods narrowed to 7.195 billion pounds ($9.30 billion).

National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) index of business conditions was flat at +3 in January, short of the long-run average of +6.
The survey's volatile measure of business confidence added 1 point to -1, with sales and profitability remaining weak.
One area of worry was the index of employment, which stumbled 3 points to just +1 in January, implying slower jobs growth.
""The picture painted by the first survey of 2020 is broadly similar to that at the end of 2019,"" said NAB Group Chief Economist Alan Oster.
""While there has been no significant deterioration in overall terms the survey continues to suggest very little to no growth in the private sector.""
The impact of the bushfires that intensified steadily through December, hurting tourism and spending at the peak of the holiday period, was felt in the most populous states of New South Wales and Victoria.
""Looking forward, businesses themselves do not anticipate a material improvement with forward orders still weak (and negative) and capacity utilization having fluctuated around its average in recent months,"" Oster added.
NAB will separately release results of a special bushfire-related survey in coming weeks, it added.
Oster said there was a risk that ongoing weakness in business activity could result in a pull-back in hiring intentions in a disappointing outcome for the country's central bank which is expecting unemployment to fall further.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates three times last year to a record low 0.75% to help revive growth and inflation. The cuts helped boost home prices and sent the jobless rate sliding to 5.1%.

Total retail spending edged up by an annual 0.4% in January, the British Retail Consortium said.
The average increase over the past 12 months was just 0.2%, the lowest since BRC's records began in 1995, while like-for-like retail sales in January, excluding changes in floor space from one year to the next, were flat.
""Although static sales might not appear triumphant, at least it is no further deterioration,"" Paul Martin, a partner at accountancy firm KPMG which produces the survey with BRC, said.
""Consumer confidence has started to return post-general election, but we have not experienced any major leaps for the sector yet.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a bigger-than-expected majority on the Dec. 12 election which ended the short-term uncertainty about whether Britain would leave the European Union at the end of January.
There have been signs that businesses and the housing market saw a jump in confidence and activity in January, although many companies are worried about the risk that Britain and the EU fail to get a trade deal by a Dec. 31 deadline.
A separate survey by Barclaycard, which covers a broader range spending, was more upbeat, showing an annual 3.9% jump in spending by consumers in January, boosted by spending on fuel and at supermarkets.
Spending at cinemas jumped by 22%, helped by the release of ""1917"", while travel agents and airlines also saw sales rise.
Barclaycard said consumer confidence in the British economy hit its highest level since September 2016 at 42%.

Sentix's index for the euro zone fell to 5.2 from 7.6 in January. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a fall to 4.1.
The slight drop reflects the fact that investors think the economic damage from the novel virus has been mostly limited to China, said Sentix chief Manfred Huebner, adding that the global economy was getting impetus from the United States.
""The outbreak of the coronavirus and the subsequent drastic measures taken by the Chinese government cast a shadow over the economic outlook,"" said Huebner. ""Fortunately, so far the effect is limited.""
He added: ""However, in view of the significant declines in Chinese economic data, it is clear that the negative effect is likely to be much greater if it does not become apparent in the coming days that the spread of the virus has been taken away.""

December's plunge in output, the largest drop since January 2018, was the third in the last four months and suggests Italy's long-running manufacturing slump may be deepening.
A Reuters survey of 10 analysts had pointed to a 0.5% fall, with no forecasts below -1.0%.
November's data was revised down slightly to show a flat reading, originally reported as 0.1%.
In the fourth quarter, output in the euro zone's third largest economy was down 1.4% compared with the previous three months, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported.
That followed a 0.8% fall in the third quarter and was the steepest drop since the fourth quarter of 2012.
Over the whole of 2019 industrial output, adjusted for the number of days worked, was down 1.3% from the year before, reflecting the persistent difficulties of Italy's manufacturing sector.
The 2019 decline followed a 0.6% rise in 2018 and was the first annual drop since 2014.
Industrial output was weak across the board in December, ISTAT said, with output of consumer goods, investment goods, intermediate goods and energy products all down more than 2% from the month before.
On a work-day adjusted year-on-year basis, output in December was down 4.3%, following a 0.8% fall in November. That was revised down from an originally reported -0.6%.
The 4.3% year-on-year drop in December was the steepest since December 2018.
Italy's economy contracted by a preliminary 0.3% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, ISTAT reported last month, raising the risk that the stagnation of the previous seven quarters could become a recession.
Italian industrial output fell by around a quarter during a steep double dip recession between 2008 and 2013, and has regained only a small part of that during a modest recovery in the subsequent years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth accelerated in January, with unseasonably mild temperatures boosting hiring in weather-sensitive sectors, indicating the economy will probably continue to grow moderately despite a deepening slump in business investment.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday, however, showed the economy created 514,000 fewer jobs between April 2018 and March 2019 than originally estimated.
The strong start to 2020 is a boost to President Donald Trump who is seeking a second term in office in the Nov. 3 election, but the biggest downgrade to payrolls over a 12-month period since 2009 showed the labor market was not as robust as the Republican president has boasted.
""Strong job creation in January provided reassurance that the record-long economic expansion still has room to run,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""But this latest health report also points to a maturing labor market, with benchmark revisions showing it isn't as youthful as it has pretended to be over the last two years.""
Non-farm payrolls increased by 225,000 jobs last month, with employment at construction sites increasing by the most in a year amid milder-than-normal temperatures, the government's survey of establishments showed. There were also strong gains in hiring in the transportation and warehousing industry.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would rise by 160,000 jobs in January. Some said the unusually warm weather was likely throwing off the model the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data, juicing the numbers. With the coronavirus hitting the Chinese economy hard, U.S. payrolls growth could slow in the coming months.
The Federal Reserve on Friday flagged the coronavirus as a risk to the U.S. economy.
""Until it is clear that the hiring was due to an upward shift in the overall economic growth rate, we have to assume that there are weaker numbers coming sometime during the next few months,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, the slowest performance in three years, after logging 2.9% growth in 2018. Growth this year is seen around 2%. The benchmark revisions left job gains in 2019 at 2.1 million, the fewest since 2011. 
Trump, speaking ahead of a trip to North Carolina, described the job numbers as ""fantastic"" and added that ""jobs continue to be great, our country continues to do great.""
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the sharp downgrade to payrolls in the 12 months through last March ""shows the rot at the heart of the Trump economy."" She noted that ""three years in, the Trump economy is creating 42,000 fewer jobs a month on average than the last three years of President Obama.""

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RISES
Economists said the size of the benchmark revisions, which showed substantial downgrades to manufacturing employment from August through December 2018, suggested the government might not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of Trump's 19-month trade war with China, which has contributed to the longest downturn in business investment since 2009. 
(Graphic: U.S. employment - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY-JOBS/010011CJ4GM/us-unemployment.jpg)
""Tariffs hit activity and employment in a way that the BLS did not incorporate at the time,"" said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS in Stamford Connecticut. ""We believe the same is happening now.""
Stocks on Wall Street retreated from record highs as investors focused on the benchmark revisions. The dollar (DXY) traded higher against a basket of currencies while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. 
Economists said the report supported the Fed's desire to keep interest rates unchanged this year.The government also introduced updated population estimates to its smaller household survey data. The unemployment rate is calculated from the household survey. 
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 63.4% last month, the highest since June 2013. As a result, the jobless rate rose to 3.6% from 3.5% in December. 
Economists said the higher participation rate, if sustained, suggests the economy needs to create about 130,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population, instead of the 100,000 estimated by Fed officials.
""Despite the downward pressure from an aging workforce, the participation rate has edged higher over the past few years amid a vigorous rebound in prime-age, especially women's prime-age, participation,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
With slack still remaining in the labor market, wage inflation remains tame. Average hourly earnings increased 0.2%, last month after gaining 0.1% in December. That lifted the annual increase in wages to 3.1% in January from 3.0% in December. The average workweek was 34.3 hours for a third straight month in January. 
The construction industry added 44,000 jobs in January, the largest since January 2019, after payrolls increased by 11,000 in December. Employment in the transportation and warehousing industry accelerated by 28,000, driven by gains in the hiring of couriers and messengers.
Payrolls in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 36,000 jobs. Healthcare and social assistance employment rose by 47,200 jobs. There were also gains in hiring in the professional and business services, and wholesale trade industries.
But manufacturing employment declined by 12,000 jobs after falling by 5,000 in December. The industry has been the hardest hit by the U.S.-China trade war. Though Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal last month, U.S. tariffs on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total, remained in place.

Manufacturing is also being squeezed by Boeing's (N:BA) suspension last month of production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner. Boeing's biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc, said last month it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its facility in Wichita, Kansas because of the 737 MAX production suspension.
The mining and logging industry added no jobs last month, while retail payrolls dropped 8,300. Further job losses are likely as Macy's (N:M) announced layoffs and closures this week.
Government payrolls rose by 19,000 jobs in January, with some hiring for the 2020 decennial census.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada added more than twice the number of jobs than expected in January, the latest indication that the economy could be strong enough to persuade the Bank of Canada not to cut rates next month.
Statistics Canada said on Friday that 34,500 jobs had been created in January, the second straight month of healthy gains after a record loss in November. The unemployment rate dipped to a near record low 5.5%.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a gain of 15,000 positions and for the jobless rate to stay at 5.6%.
The Bank of Canada has held its key interest rate steady since October 2018 but said last month a cut was possible if a recent slowdown in domestic growth persisted. The bank's next scheduled rate announcement is March 4.
Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said the data was better than expected.
""I think it's strong enough to give the Bank of Canada a little bit more encouragement and maybe hold off (on cutting rates) in March,"" he said in a phone interview.
Market expectations of an interest rate cut in March, as reflected in the overnight index swaps markets, dipped to 10.89% from 12.89% before the data was released. 
All the gains were in full-time jobs, said Statscan. The goods-producing sector added 49,100 positions - almost half of them in manufacturing - while the service sector shed 14,500.
The hourly wages for permanent employees - a number closely watched by the Bank of Canada - rose by 4.4% compared with January 2019 and were up from 3.8% in December. 
""(It's a) pretty solid number seeming to indicate that the Canadian economy isn't losing too much steam, so a positive start to the year in that regard,"" said Josh Nye, a senior economist with RBC Economics.
""We think that slow growth leaves the door open to the Bank of Canada lowering interest rates. This jobs number this morning perhaps gives them a bit less urgency to do that.""
Recent data showed the economy surprisingly grew in November, the trade deficit narrowed in December and manufacturing activity expanded in January for the fifth straight month.

The Canadian dollar briefly rose to 1.3284 against the greenback, or 75.28 U.S. cents, from 1.3314, or 75.11 U.S. cents, before falling back.

The overall U.S. labor-force participation rate climbed to 63.4% in January, the biggest share since June 2013. Drilling into the latest data released Friday, the gain reflects the highest participation in almost two decades among prime-age women who are 25 to 54, called that because the years are key for career-building.
Among women, the fastest increases were among millennials and younger Gen Xers, with the biggest gains for those in their early 20s and 30s, and among females aged 35 to 44 -- a full 1.4-point jump last year. Meanwhile, the participation rate of those age 45 to 54 retreated in January for a second month.
What’s more, 2.7 million women who weren’t in the labor force before January, entered and found a job. That was more than the almost 2.2 million men who went from out of the labor force to employed, underscoring sustained demand for workers.
Men in their prime still participate at a higher rate -- about nine out of 10 compared with eight out of 10 women. But the prime-age male participation rate has eased from a high last year of 89.5% in March and remains below levels in prior decades.
There are plenty of theories for this, ranging from an opioid epidemic that disproportionately affects men, to a manufacturing jobs decline in recent decades. There’s also employer demand for those with a college degree, as college-educated women outnumber men in the U.S."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers are set to agree this month a more growth-friendly fiscal policy, three EU officials said on Friday, a change from current targets that would pave the way for more spending in Germany amid fears of a downturn.
Repeated attempts to boost investment and growth in the 19-country bloc have failed in past years as Germany, the euro zone's largest economy, kept posting large budget surpluses despite calls to spend more.
But now, amid fresh recession fears in Germany and concerns about the impact on the global economy of the coronavirus outbreak in China, euro zone countries have reached a preliminary agreement to increase spending in the event of a downturn.
""If downside risks were to materialize, fiscal responses should be differentiated, aiming for a more supportive stance at the aggregate level,"" a draft text agreed by euro zone envoys said, according to an official who had access to it.
Other two senior EU officials confirmed the preliminary compromise, which needs to be formalized by euro zone finance ministers at a meeting in Brussels on Feb. 17.
The text, agreed after lengthy negotiations, stresses that higher spending would need to be compliant with EU fiscal rules which mandate a deficit below 3% of gross domestic product, among other requirements.
Despite its restrictions, the move would mark a departure from past statements in which euro zone ministers had recommended a ""broadly neutral"" fiscal stance, despite weak economic growth.
The change would allow governments with more solid finances to focus more on growth rather than stability as they begin planning for next year's national budgets.
It could also send a positive message to investors that the bloc is finally heeding calls from the European Central Bank to complement its loose monetary policy with a fiscal push that could make it more effective.
Germany has long insisted on keeping budgets under tight control in a bid to reduce imbalances in countries of the bloc with high levels of debt, like Italy or Greece.
But views in Berlin may be slowly changing after weak growth last year and concerns that in the last quarter Germany may have fallen into recession because of tumbling industry output.
Germany's Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has said in past months that Germany would loosen the purse strings in the event of an economic crisis, but despite last year's slowdown it has posted large budget surpluses in the first nine months, Eurostat figures released in January show.
The EU Commission will unveil on Thursday its quarterly forecasts for the euro zone economy and the figures will be discussed by ministers when they adopt the recommendation on the bloc's fiscal stance. That could help the case of those supporting more spending, an EU official said."

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy stayed in robust health in January, with no visible impact from the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, but the figures weren’t enough to give any further momentum to markets that had already rallied sharply earlier in the week.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the U.S. economy created 225,000 jobs in January, well above initial forecasts for a rise of 160,000. However, the impact of the data was blunted by a strong reading for private-sector payrolls from ADP earlier in the week.
With the headline number neutered, market attention focused on other elements of the report, which gave a more mixed picture.
Average weekly earnings, for example, rose only 0.2% on the month, below expectations for a 0.3% gain, but in annual terms they ticked up to 3.1%. Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected that rate to stay at 3.0% this month. 
""Slowing wage growth for both supervisors and production workers. Certainly no inflation pressures for the Fed to worry about,"" said Julia Coronado, a professor of UT Austin and former Federal Reserve economist, via Twitter.
The jobless rate, meanwhile, ticked up slightly to 3.6% from 3.5% - another apparent inconsistency with the strong rise in employment.
Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab, said the report was “strong”, but noted declines in both manufacturing and retail jobs. These were offset by a big increase in jobs in the education and health sectors, along with construction jobs.
The S&P 500 futures contract edged down in the hour following the report, as market participants found little convincing evidence to add to gains posted so far this week. Although the contract was down 0.4% from late Thursday by 9:25 AM ET (1425 GMT), it was still up more than 2.5% for the week – a remarkable performance given the ongoing concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
On Thursday, both luxury goods maker Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) and auto giant Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (NYSE:FCAU) had warned of negative impacts on sales and production, respectively. Those warnings were echoed by British fashion group   Burberry   (LON:BRBY) early on Friday, which said footfall in its Chinese stores was down by 80% on the year. However, French cosmetics giant L’Oreal (OTC:LRLCY)– another company with heavy exposure to China - said it expects only a temporary impact.
In other markets, the dollar index was likewise little changed after the numbers, on course for its highest weekly close since September after a 0.7% rise over the week. The greenback has also hit various highs against emerging market currencies this week as other central banks have cut interest rates, reinforcing the impression that the U.S. is better insulated against the outbreak than many other countries.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell by three basis points to 1.59% on the report, its lowest in three days."

Investing.com - The U.S. economy continued to do a good job with job creation in January, while annual wage growth also accelerated.
Nonfarm payrolls for the month rose by 225,000, up from a rise of 145,000 in December. This was well ahead of the expected 160,000, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The jobless rate rose to 3.6% of the workforce from 3.5%, however.
Average hourly earnings, a measure of wage inflation, rose 0.2% in January, and were up 3.1% year on year, broadly in line with expectations.
The market had already been primed for a bullish number on nonfarm payrolls after ADP’s monthly report on private-sector hiring showed an increase by 291,000 jobs in January, the most since May 2015.
The Dow 30 futures contract, which had rallied sharply earlier in the week, had dropped 45 points within 10 minutes of the report to be down 0.4% on the day. EUR/USD was little changed at $1.0961. "
1266,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 09:03AM ET</span>",Canada’s Labor Market Picks Up Steam for Second Month,"(Bloomberg) -- Canadian employment strengthened for a second-straight month, helping quell concerns that a weak labor market might force the Bank of Canada to promptly lower interest rates.
Canada’s economy added 34,500 positions in January, all in full-time work, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa. That beat economist expectations for 17,500 new jobs. The unemployment rate dropped slightly to 5.5% in the month, from 5.6% in December. Wage gains accelerated 4.4% and hours worked rose 0.5%.
Today’s positive reading coupled with December’s print of a similar employment gain has more than offset the weakness in November, when the country shed 54,400 jobs. The three-month moving trend turned positive for the first time since October, another reassuring sign for the economy.
Canada’s currency appreciated on the report and was trading up 0.2% to C$1.3308 against its U.S. counterpart at 8:48 a.m. Toronto time. Two-year government bond yields were little changed at 1.48%.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 08:21AM ET</span>",Brazil inflation posts lowest January rise since 'Real Plan' launch in 1994,"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian inflation kicked off the year on a soft footing, official figures on Friday showed, as the IPCA consumer price index posted its smallest January increase since the country's ""Real Plan"" was launched more than quarter of a century ago.
Consumer prices rose by 0.21% on the month, down from 1.15% in December and lower than the 0.34% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, driven by a sharp decline in meat prices.
That was the lowest inflation rate for any month of January since the so-called ""Real Plan"", which introduced the currency still in use today, was launched in July 1994 to end Brazil's history of hyper-inflation.
The annual rate of inflation was 4.19%, also down from 4.31% the month before and less than the 4.32% economists had expected.
""This probably marks the peak for inflation, and with the economic recovery this year likely to be slower than most expect, monetary conditions will likely stay loose,"" Quinn Markwith, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
The central bank this week cut interest rates to a new low of 4.25% and signaled that would be the last in the cycle. Its inflation outlook for this year softened slightly to 3.5%, below its official goal of 4.00%, while its 2021 outlook of 3.7% was roughly in line with its 3.75% target.
The slowdown in inflation last month was largely driven by food and beverage prices, and meat prices in particular, IBGE said.
After surging 18% in December, meat prices fell 4% in January, slowing the monthly pace of food and beverages inflation to 0.39% from 3.38% in December. That led to a 0.11 percentage point drag on the overall index.
Transport inflation also slowed, to 0.32% in January from 1.54% in December, while on the upside housing costs rose 0.55% in the month following a fall of 0.82% in December, IBGE said.
January's calculations were based on a new basket of goods and services to monitor changes in consumer habits, and included transport prices from apps aggregated for the first time by a virtual robot, IBGE said."
1268,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 04:21AM ET</span>",French industrial output plunges in December as strikes weigh,"PARIS (Reuters) - French industrial production fell much more sharply than expected in December as factories contended with nationwide transport strikes and a broader European slowdown, official data showed on Friday.
The INSEE stats agency said industrial output plunged 2.8% in December from November when production was flat, marking the biggest drop in nearly two years.
The result missed economists average forecast for a decrease of only 0.3% with none of the 26 economists polled by Reuters expecting anything worse than a -2.5% drop.
Manufacturers were forced to slow production in December as supply lines were hit by industrial action against President Emmanuel Macron's overhaul of pensions.
Economists have blamed the slowdown in large part for a surprise decrease in overall economic growth in the fourth quarter when it fell 0.1% from the previous three months.
However, weak industrial output in other European countries suggest there was more behind the French slowdown than just domestic problems. Germany reported a 3.5% plunge on Friday in its industrial output.
Offering some solace, the French customs office said that the trade deficit narrowed in December to 4.1 billion euros from 5.4 billion in November as imports fell faster than exports.
Although the economy slowed in the final quarter, data published separately by INSEE suggested on Friday that the labor market continued to improve.
INSEE said the economy added 40,700 net new private sector jobs in the period, which makes a solid 210,100 for the year."

Average house prices rose 0.4% from December to 240,054 pounds ($310,000), the mortgage lender said in a statement on Friday. From a year earlier, prices increased by 4.1%.
Other measures have also pointed to an improving mood about the property market. According to Rightmove. asking prices for homes increased 2.3% in January, a record for that month.
The vote to leave the European Union in 2016 has kept the U.K. property market subdued for years. While Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decisive election victory has led to stronger sentiment, most forecasters see small gains in the coming year.
“We still expect a moderate rate of house price growth over the course of the year,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax. “It’s too early to say if a corner has been turned.”"
1270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 07, 2020 04:03AM ET</span>",German Recession Risk Returns With Crisis-Era Plunge in Output,"Germany is facing a possible recession again after industrial production plunged by the most since the global financial crisis.
The 3.5% slide in December’s output comes a day after a report showed factory orders declining at the fastest pace in more than a decade. That suggests Europe’s largest economy may have contracted at the end of 2019, according to Bloomberg Economics, and dragging itself out of the hole this year has become even more challenging with the coronavirus hitting global business.
Germany has been pummeled by trade tensions, Brexit and the climate-change challenges engulfing its auto industry, and the latest data will dampen budding optimism that it can recover soon. Surveys have shown improved sentiment about the outlook, yet the hard data continues to be worse than economists expected.
GDP figures for the whole economy are due next week and a contraction could prompt renewed calls for fiscal stimulus. Germany’s government, which has run a budget surplus for years, has so far insisted that it’s raising spending but there’s no crisis that would warrant a special package.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“The data sit oddly against a backdrop of gently improving sentiment in Germany. The fact that production fell across the euro area also suggests part of the weakness reflects a common factor, rather than just a deepening of Germany’s idiosyncratic problems.”
-Jamie Rush, Read his GERMANY REACT
There was further bad news for Europe on Friday, with France reporting a 2.8% drop in industrial output in December, and Spain posting a 1.4% decline. Both readings were far worse than economists had anticipated. The Netherlands added to the gloom, with manufacturing shrinking 1.7%, the most since 2018.
The euro fell, and could close at its weakest since October. It traded down 0.2% to $1.0966 as of 9:36 a.m. Frankfurt time.
Part of the French weakness may have been due to protests and strikes that hit the economy in December and January. Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said it was a “temporary hiccup.”
“There was a bad surprise in the fourth quarter, which is that the strikes weighed temporarily and negatively on business inventories,” he said on Europe 1 Radio.
Likewise, Germany can attribute some of its poor performance to construction, which sank as companies took holiday breaks. The Economy Ministry pointed to signs of improving sentiment that could brighten industrial production in coming months.
While the U.S.-China trade war has eased though, new risks have appeared. U.S. President Donald Trump has revived his threat of tariffs on European imports, and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned this week that the coronavirus outbreak adds another layer of uncertainty.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG is among German companies from aerospace to car makers that were forced to shut their Chinese plants because of the coronavirus outbreak. Construction equipment maker Wacker Neuson and Daimler warned last month their 2019 performance was worse than expected.
“The data has raised the risk that next week’s GDP data could bring back the R-word for the German economy,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief German economist at ING in Frankfurt. “2019 was definitely a year to forget for German industry.”"

House prices increased by 0.4% on the month in January, above economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for them to stay unchanged after an unusually big 1.8% jump in December.
Halifax was cautious about the outlook for the rest of 2020.
""It’s too early to say if a corner has been turned. The recent positive figures may actually represent activity that would ordinarily have been expected to take place last year, but was delayed by economic uncertainty,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said."

Labor Department data due at 8:30 a.m. Friday in Washington will show 165,000 jobs were added in January as private hiring rise to 155,000, according to Bloomberg’s survey of economists. The jobless rate is seen holding at a half-century low of 3.5%, while annual wage growth improved to 3% from a 17-month low of 2.9%.
“We’re looking for a healthy employment report in January, but one that confirms a gentle cooling of the U.S. economy,” said Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics. He sees a 162,000 gain.
Other measures signal strength. The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute on Wednesday reported that firms added 291,000 jobs in January, the most since 2015. Unemployment benefit filings are lowest since April, and the Conference Board’s labor differential, which shows the share of consumers who say jobs are plentiful exceeds those who say they’re hard to get, is near the highest since 2000.
The Federal Reserve last week kept policy on hold while affirming solid hiring. “The labor market continues to be strong,” Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters. “We see strong job creation. We see low unemployment.”
Here’s what economists are saying, with payroll projections listed from low to high:
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)
145,000 jobs, 3.5% unemployment, 2.9% annual wage gain“We expect ongoing moderation,” Chief Economist James Sweeney wrote. “Lead indicators have been solid, with the ISM non-manufacturing employment index holding its gains after a rebound and initial claims reverting back to the low-200s range.”S&P Global Ratings
150,000 jobs, 3.5% unemployment, 3% annual wage gain“Firm consumer confidence readings, including a boost in the labor market differential, and a slip in jobless claims all point to a healthy jobs market for the month,” U.S. Chief Economist Beth Ann Bovino wrote. “Labor market conditions will likely remain healthy in 2020. We expect solid employment growth of about 150,000 average per month in the first half of the year, in tandem with increased prime-aged employment growth.” Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)
155,000 jobs, 3.5% unemployment, 3.1% annual wage gain“Sector swings to watch for this month are professional and business services and transportation and warehouse payrolls,” which could rebound from December weakness, Chief U.S. Economist Ellen Zentner wrote. “On the flip side, retail trade payrolls had an unusually strong gain in December so could reverse downwards in January. How these swing factors resolve should be taken into consideration when gauging underlying trends in January.”Bloomberg Economics
160,000 jobs, 3.5% unemployment, 3.1% annual wage gain“While moderating economic growth in 2020 could temper the pace of hiring, it will not disrupt the gradual, upward sloping trend of wage pressures and labor-cost inflation,” economists Carl Riccadonna, Yelena Shulyatyeva and Andrew Husby wrote. “Average hourly earnings may have missed to the downside in December, but one month is hardly a trend -- in fact, the trend has been in line with what should be expected as labor slack diminishes.” Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)
160,000 jobs, 3.5% unemployment, 3% annual wage gain“Given the instrumental role that the consumer plays, elevated confidence in the labor market is supportive to our call for extended economic expansion,” Senior Economist Sam Bullard wrote. “The labor market remains strong across most measures, though there are signs of deceleration. While job cuts remain low, openings are trending down.”NatWest Markets
165,000 jobs, 3.5% unemployment, 3.1% annual wage gain“We expect further moderation in the trend in payroll growth in 2020,” consistent with slower output growth relative to last year’s 2.3% fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter pace, Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI) and Michelle Girard wrote. “We expect the jobless rate remained steady at 3.5% in January, which would coincide with consumers’ favorable assessment of the labor market.” Citigroup  (NYSE:C)
187,000 jobs, 3.5% unemployment, 3% annual wage gain“A stronger-than-consensus increase in jobs, as we expect, would support the risk-on movement in markets, following other stronger U.S. data releases this week such as ISM manufacturing,” economist Veronica Clark wrote. “Following a weaker-than-expected December employment report that revealed moderate job growth, softer wages, and revisions lower to average hours worked, we expect a stronger January report will reaffirm that the labor market remains healthy overall.”"

The customs office issued the statement in the afternoon in response to a query about the January data, which had been expected to be released around 11 a.m. local time (0300 GMT) on Friday.

The current situation index fell to 83.7 in January, the lowest since March 2015, according to the Reserve Bank of India’s consumer confidence survey, where 100 is the dividing line between pessimism and optimism. Another survey showed capacity utilization at companies dropped to 69.1% in the second quarter of the year ending March -- the lowest since the RBI started tracking it in 2009 -- mirroring subdued demand conditions.
“Current perception on the general economic situation, price levels and household income remained weak when compared with the position a year ago,” the central bank said in the survey that covered 13 major cities. Households reported lower spending on non-essential items.
As consumers reduced spending, companies too cut back on production. Capacity utilization fell from 73.6% in the April-June period, according to a separate central bank report that covers the manufacturing sector and surveyed 866 companies.
The sustained drop means the output gap is widening -- the difference between actual and potential production -- and will push policy makers to keep rates lower for longer. On Thursday, the RBI kept benchmark rates at a decade-low of 5.15% and resorted to more unconventional tools to bring borrowing costs down and boost demand in an economy on course for its weakest expansion since 2009.
The survey findings temper any optimism about a growth turnaround, after recent purchasing managers surveys, as well as coal, steel, cement and electricity production data, indicated some recovery. The economy is set to expand 5% in the year to March, the weakest pace since 2009."

The index of permanent job placements from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation and accountants KPMG hit its highest level since December 2018 at 52.3, up from 51.9 in December.
The survey chimed with other signals of the economy perking up in early 2020 following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's sweeping election win on Dec. 12, after a near standstill in late 2019.
Last week, the Bank of England decided against cutting interest rates as it waited to see if the signs of a recovery translate into a pickup in economic growth.
""It's good to see that businesses have grown in confidence over the past two months and taken the opportunity to restart hiring,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
There were also some less positive signals in REC's survey.
Starting salaries for permanent staff grew at the slowest rate since July 2016, immediately after the Brexit referendum.
The REC report also showed temporary staff hiring fell for the first time since 2013, possibly reflecting concerns about reforms aimed at tackling tax avoidance that are likely to affect temporary workers.
A separate survey published on Friday showed British retailers had their biggest sales increase in six years in January, helped by the election and price-cutting.
Accountancy firm BDO said its High Street Sales Tracker found sales jumped by 5.7% last month, the biggest annual rise since January 2014, with gains seen across all sectors.
Until now there has not been a clear sign of a post-election improvement in the mood of consumers similar to the increase in confidence among businesses.
BDO warned that the January sales surge might not last.
""This may be a false dawn in terms of a high street recovery,"" Sophie Michael, national head of retail and wholesale at BDO, said.
There were signs that retailers were sitting on high levels of stock and that buying orders had fallen again, suggesting that discounting was driving sales, Michael said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese household spending fell at a much faster pace than expected in December, sliding for the third straight month in a sign consumers are having a hard time coping with a sales tax hike.
The world's third-largest economy is struggling to regain momentum after last October's sales tax hike led consumers to curb spending. China's coronavirus epidemic poses a new threat to the global growth outlook and Japan's output and exports.
Household spending slipped 4.8% in December from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, coming in well below a median forecast for a 1.7% decline.
Following the tax hike to 10% from 8%, the first such rise in four and a half years, it tumbled 5.1% in October, the fastest pace of decline since March 2016, and dropped 2.0% in November.
Japanese policymakers are hoping on a recovery in domestic demand largely fueled by resilience in consumer spending to help soften the blow to businesses' profits from a delayed pick-up in global growth.
Stronger consumer spending is also needed to help achieve the Bank of Japan's elusive 2% price target.
Sluggish wage recovery is leading to further worries about private spending, with inflation-adjusted real wages falling 0.9% to also drop for a third month in December.
For the whole of 2019, real wages also lost 0.9%, reversing a 0.2% gain in 2018, the data showed.
While Friday's reading excludes the impact on spending from the virus outbreak originating in China, analysts expect it will hurt consumption in the coming months as tourism takes a hit.
Japan's economy is expected to have shrunk in the fourth quarter last year due to fallout from the sales tax hike and a powerful typhoon, after it had expanded an upwardly revised annualized 1.8% in the July-September period.
A preliminary U.S.-China trade deal had raised hopes globally of a let-up in the pressure facing businesses worldwide, in particular export-reliant nations like Japan.
But uncertainty on how the spread of the coronavirus could affect China - a major engine of global growth - has now cast doubt on the BOJ's optimistic economic projection.
The BOJ expects the economy to recover this year, holding onto hope that global growth will rebound around mid-year and provide a lift to exports."

Accountancy firm BDO said its High Street Sales Tracker found sales jumped by 5.7% last month, the biggest annual rise since January 2014, with gains seen across all sectors.
There have been signs of a pick-up among companies since Johnson's Dec. 12 election victory, which cleared up the short-term uncertainty about Brexit and ended the possibility of a big shift in economic policy under the opposition Labour Party.
Last week, the Bank of England held off on cutting interest rates as it waited to see if the improved confidence among companies translates into a broader economic recovery.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dropped to a nine-month low last week, suggesting a tightening labor market would continue to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track despite weak business investment.
While other data on Thursday showed worker productivity rebounding in the fourth quarter, the trend remained sluggish, indicating that the economy will probably remain on a moderate growth path. Lackluster productivity is squeezing corporate profits. Economists say this could make businesses, which have already cut back on capital expenditures, cautious about hiring. 
""Compression of profit margins usually precedes a recession, as it causes businesses to become more cautious,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moodys' Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""This is likely one factor behind the recent weakness in business investment.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 202,000 for the week ended Feb. 1, the lowest reading since last April, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dipping to 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Alabama and Pennsylvania were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,000 to 211,750 last week, also the lowest level since last April.
The claims data has no bearing on January's employment report, which is scheduled for release on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. Claims were lower in January relative to December, suggesting a pick-up in job growth. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 160,000 jobs in January after rising 145,000 in December. Employment gains could, however, exceed expectations given unseasonably mild weather, which could have boosted hiring at construction sites and in the leisure and hospitality industry. 
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment report on Wednesday showed private payrolls surged by 291,000 jobs in January, the most since May 2015, after increasing 199,000 in December.
The dollar firmed marginally against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with investor sentiment buoyed by China's plan to slash additional tariffs on some American goods by 50%.
WARNING SIGNS
Labor market strength is helping to underpin consumer spending, supporting the economy, now in its 11th year of expansion. But tepid productivity remains a challenge and is one of the reasons the economy has struggled to achieve the Trump administration's target of 3% annual growth. 
The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, the slowest in three years, after logging 2.9% in 2018. 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 1.4% annualized rate last quarter.
Productivity decreased at an unrevised 0.2% pace in the July-September period, the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2015. Economists had forecast productivity rebounding at a 1.6% rate in the fourth quarter.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, productivity increased at a 1.8% rate. It accelerated 1.7% in 2019, the strongest since 2010, after increasing 1.3% in 2018.
Productivity increased at an average annual rate of 1.3% from 2007 to 2019, below its long-term rate of 2.1% from 1947 to 2019, indicating that the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation has slowed. Economist estimate the economy's growth potential at 1.8%.
""A lot of an economy's productivity gains are dependent on investment spending and it is a concern that businesses are making fewer capital expenditures to prepare for growth later this year and beyond,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Despite the low level of jobless claims, there are some warning signs flashing for the labor market. Job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers jumped 106% to an 11-month high of 67,735 in January, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in another report on Thursday.
The surge in layoffs was led by technology companies, with 13,869 planned job cuts. There were also redundancies in the retail sector last month, many because of bankruptcies and store closings. Manufacturers, which have been hurt by trade tensions and slowing global growth, continued to shed workers.
The Labor Department's annual benchmark revisions to payrolls data to be published on Friday are expected to show some cooling in the jobs market. 
The government last August estimated the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade. That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000.
Economists say the size of the estimated revision suggests that payrolls data from April 2019 through March this year could also be revised lower. 

But the pace of job gains is more than the 100,000 per month needed to keep up with growth in the working age population. The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at 3.5% in January.

The Labor Department said on Thursday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 1.4% annualized rate last quarter. Productivity decreased at an unrevised 0.2% pace in the July-September period, the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2015.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity rebounding at a 1.6% rate in the fourth quarter.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, productivity increased at a 1.8% rate. It accelerated 1.7% in 2019, the strongest since 2010, after increasing 1.3% in 2018.
Sluggish productivity is one the reasons the economy has struggled achieve the Trump administration's target of 3% annual growth. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, the slowest in three years, after logging 2.9% in 2018.
Productivity increased at an average annual rate of 1.3% from 2007 to 2019, below its long-term rate of 2.1% from 1947 to 2019, indicating that the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation has slowed.
Economist estimate the economy's growth potential at around 1.8%. Some economists blame tepid productivity on a shortage of workers as well as the impact of rampant drug addiction in some parts of the country. 
Others also argue that low capital expenditure, which they say has resulted in a sharp drop in the capital-to-labor ratio, is holding down productivity. There is also a belief that productivity is being inaccurately measured, especially on the information technology side. 
Hours worked rose at a 1.1% rate in the fourth quarter. That was down from the 2.5% pace notched in the third quarter, when hours were boosted by a surge in the volatile self-employed and unpaid family workers component. 
With productivity rebounding last quarter, growth in unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - slowed to a 1.4% rate. Unit labor costs increased at a 2.5% rate in the July-September period.
Compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, labor costs grew at a 2.4% rate. They increased 2.0% in 2019 after rising 1.8% in 2018, suggesting inflation will probably continue to run below the Federal Reserve's 2% target even as the labor market has tightened.

Hourly compensation increased at a 2.8% rate in the fourth quarter. That followed a 2.3% pace in the prior quarter.

1283,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 05:06AM ET</span>","China drafts banks, brokerages and funds into war on virus","SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping is enlisting the state-dominated financial sector in a war against a virus outbreak that has killed more than 500, mobilizing lenders, brokerages and fund managers to pump resources into stricken parts of the economy.
Answering Beijing's call, banks are rushing to offer virus-fighting loans at ultra-low rates, investment banks are helping companies issue anti-virus bonds faster, and managers of mutual funds are refraining from selling stocks, to damp market panic.
Concerted efforts to rein in the virus that emerged late last year in the central city of Wuhan highlight the centralized power the ruling Communist Party wields in a sector dominated by state-owned companies.
But the campaign, which has stirred memories of government rescue efforts during a market crash in 2015, deepens concern over corporate governance in China and risks sowing seeds of future trouble.
Wuhan DDMC Culture & Sports Co (SS:600136), a leisure company in the city, won Shanghai Stock Exchange approval to issue bonds of up to 600 million yuan ($86 million) via a ""green channel"" created for virus-hit companies, it said on Thursday.
""It's like receiving charcoal on a snowy day,"" the company, whose operations were wrecked by the epidemic, said on its website.
Three other companies - Zhuhai Huafa Group, Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical and China Nanshan Development Group - have raised a combined 2.1 billion yuan ($301 million) this week by issuing bonds via the interbank market, to fund virus-battling efforts.
Proceeds from the debt issuance, which won quicker-than-usual approval from regulators, will fund drug discovery programs and hospital construction, the companies said.
Regulators have also asked banks to inject cheap funds into virus-stricken areas, and not to withdraw loans from companies suffering the impact. Sectors such as tourism, transport and leisure are the worst-hit.
Bank of Suzhou, in the eastern province of Jiangsu, vowed to cut financing costs for hundreds of small corporate clients and bolster lending.
For companies such as food producers, logistics firms and makers of anti-virus drugs, it will cut the rate on loans by 10 basis points below the lending benchmark, to stand as low as 3.98%.
A loan officer at Bank of China promised special treatment for those defaulting because of virus fallout, saying the central bank would cap interest on loans to firms with operations critical to beating the virus, such as makers of masks and drugs.
He added, ""Such companies will enjoy the lowest possible rates.""
But the orchestrated support also triggered concerns of moral hazard among some.
""I'm afraid many companies about to go bankrupt will come and say their businesses are affected by the virus outbreak,"" said a bond fund manager, who declined to be named.
A flurry of government support has helped stabilize stocks in China's equity market after a plunge on Monday.
Regulators have told major mutual fund companies and insurers not to cut net equity positions this week, and urged brokerages to limit short-selling activities by clients, said sources who sought anonymity.
Fund managers were also nudged to do their bit. China's fund association, which is supervised by the securities regulator, said employees at 26 mutual fund houses had put their own money - or more than 2 billion yuan ($287 million) - into fund products since Monday.
Shi Bo, a fund manager at China Southern (NYSE:SO) Asset Management, added his remarks to a chorus of market-soothing views orchestrated by regulators.
""Despite short-term corrections triggered by the new virus outbreak, the long-term uptrend of the A-share market is intact,"" he wrote this week."
1284,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2020 04:16AM ET</span>","World food prices rise for fourth month running, cereal outlook up: U.N.","ROME (Reuters) - World food prices rose for the fourth month running in January, boosted by jumps in quotations for vegetable oils, sugar and wheat, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar, averaged 182.5 points in last month, up 0.7% on the previous month.
FAO also predicted that cereal production would hit a new record in 2019 and come in some 2.3% higher than the 2018 crop.
The FAO cereal price index climbed 2.9% month-on-month in January to record its highest value since May 2018, with the prices of all major cereals rising, led by wheat.
The vegetable oil index jumped 7.0% last month to reach a three-year high and the sugar price index climbed 5.5%, while the dairy index was up 0.9%.
By contrast the meat price index fell 4.0%, ending 11 consecutive months of increases, with the price quotations for all meat categories heading lower, ""pressured by reduced purchases, especially from China and the Far East,"" FAO said.
FAO also issued a new forecast for world cereal production, predicting a record high of 2.715 billion tonnes this year.
""This month's forecast remains nearly unchanged from December, as downward revisions made for wheat and rice production are offset by upward adjustments for maize and barley,"" FAO said."

Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods fell by 2.1% from the previous month, the Statistics Office said. That was the biggest drop since February and compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.6% rise.
""The orders situation remains terrible,"" said Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Lampe. ""The coronavirus means that we'll probably have to keep waiting for a turning point.""
The reading for November was revised up to a drop of 0.8% from a previously reported fall of 1.3%.
Commenting on the figures, the Economy Ministry said major fluctuations in foreign demand for large transport equipment accounted for about a third of the drop in demand in December.
""Overall, the outlook for the industrial economy remains subdued,"" the ministry added.
The German economy narrowly dodged recession last year, and the Ifo institute's monthly survey last week showed business morale weakening, suggesting the economy got off to a slow start in 2020.
Germany's export-dependent manufacturers are struggling with sluggish demand from abroad as well as business uncertainty linked to trade disputes and Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition is at odds over how to spend the federal government's budget surplus of 13.5 billion euros. Her conservatives are calling for corporate tax cuts, while centre-left Finance Minister Olaf Scholz favors more public investment.

The 2.1% decline in December -- the steepest in almost a year -- puts a damper on recent reports suggesting that manufacturing is slowly working its way out of a slump that left the nation with the weakest annual growth since 2013. Factory orders are a key measure of the economy’s strength because they indicate future output.
The euro fell after the report and traded at $1.1000 at 8:06 a.m. Frankfurt time.
While the government has raised its 2020 growth forecast to nearly twice last year’s pace on the back of a resilient labor market, overall momentum remains muted and new risks have appeared. China’s coronavirus is disrupting global trade, the U.S. has revived threats of tariffs on European imports, and climate change is forcing companies to rethink how their business is run.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“We suspect the economy has reached its low point and expect momentum to gather pace gradually in 2020. Still, there’s no evidence of a significant recovery.”
-- Jamie Rush. 
Labor unions remain nervous about the outlook. IG Metall, Germany’s biggest union, has called on employers to refrain from cutting jobs and instead constructively working toward a strategy for future growth. While union representatives are seeking wage gains in the current bargaining round, they haven’t made specific demands.
Factory orders from the euro area plunged 13.9% in December, with a particularly sharp drop in investment goods. Domestic orders rose for a second month."

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 11:47AM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit narrows in 2019 for first time in six years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell for the first time in six years in 2019 as the White House's trade war with China curbed the import bill, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite a slowdown in consumer spending and weak business investment.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed the Trump administration's ""America First"" agenda decreased the flow of goods last year, with exports posting their first decline since 2016. President Donald Trump, who has dubbed himself ""the tariff man,"" has pledged to shrink the deficit by shutting out more unfairly traded imports and renegotiating free trade agreements.
Trump has argued that substantially cutting the trade deficit would boost annual economic growth to 3% on a sustainable basis. The economy has, however, failed to hit that mark, growing 2.3% in 2019, which was the slowest in three years, after expanding 2.9% in 2018.
With tensions in the 19-month U.S.-China trade war easing, last year's narrowing in the deficit is unlikely to be repeated.
""Since that entire drop came from the huge change in the China deficit, don't expect further declines in the years to come,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The trade deficit dropped 1.7% to $616.8 billion last year, declining for the first time since 2013. That represented 2.9% of GDP, down from 3.0% in 2018. 
Goods imports plunged 1.7% last year, also the first decrease in three years. The United States imported 2.4 billion barrels of crude oil, the fewest since 1992, as the country significantly reduced its dependence of foreign oil amid a surge in production and exploration. 
It also imported fewer capital and other goods. The 1.3% tumble in exports was led by decreases in shipments of capital goods, industrial supplies and materials, and other goods. 
At the height of the U.S.-China trade war last year, Washington slapped tariffs on billions worth of Chinese goods, including consumer products, thumping imports. 
The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China plunged 17.6% to $345.6 billion in 2019. 
The White House has also sparred with other trading partners, including the European Union, Brazil and Argentina, accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of U.S. manufacturers. But those efforts did little to rein in the goods trade deficit with the EU, which reached an all-time high of $177.9 billion. The deficit with Mexico jumped to a record high of $101.8 billion.
Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal last month. The deal, however, left in place U.S. tariffs on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total.
Goods imports rebounded sharply in December, boosting the trade deficit 11.9% to $48.9 billion that month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap would widen to $48.2 billion in December.
TEMPORARY BOOST
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit increased $4.3 billion to $80.5 billion in December. 
Trade added almost 1.5 percentage points to GDP growth in the fourth quarter, exceeding the 1.20 percentage points contribution from consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching the pace notched in the July-September period.
Though the trade deficit is expected to swell, the economy is likely to continue growing moderately, with other reports on Wednesday showing a pickup in activity in the services sector and private employers boosting hiring in January.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 55.5 last month from 54.9 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
The report came on the heels of a survey from the ISM on Monday showing manufacturing rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months.
Separately, the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report showed private payrolls jumped by 291,000 jobs in January, the most since May 2015, after increasing by 199,000 in December. Private payrolls were likely flattered by unusually mild weather and a seasonal quirk, amid signs that overall job growth has slowed.
The ADP report has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's more comprehensive employment because of methodology differences. January's employment report is scheduled for release on Friday. 
""We are always skeptical of the ADP's accuracy and that scepticism is doubled every January because firms tend to purge names from the payroll at the start of the year, even though those people may not have done and paid work for that firm for several months,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
""That distortion occasionally used to generate very weak readings at the start of the year but, in this case, it looks like the ADP could have over-compensated with an adjustment.""
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
The 3.2% surge in imports to a seven-month high of $207.5 billion in December came after three straight monthly declines and reflected a $1.7 billion increase in crude oil imports. There was also a $1.2 billion rise in imports of other goods. 
Economists believe a 15% tariff on $110 billion worth of Chinese goods that came into effect on Sept. 1 had weighed on imports in the prior months. They also say anticipation that the Phase 1 trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports in late 2019.

Goods exports rose 0.9% to $137.7 billion in December, lifted by a $1.5 billion jump in shipments of crude oil as well as a $1.0 billion increase in exports of other goods. At $17.1 billion, petroleum exports in December were the highest on record. But motor vehicle and parts exports fell $1.0 billion to $12.4 billion, the lowest since November 2016.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 55.5 last month, the highest level since August. Data for December was revised slightly down to show the index at a reading of 54.9 instead of the previously reported 55.0.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index unchanged at a reading of 55.0 in January.
The report came on the heels of a survey from the ISM on Monday showing manufacturing rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months. The improvement in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, reflected easing tensions in the 19-month U.S.-China trade war.
Any recovery in manufacturing, however, is likely to be limited by Boeing's (N:BA) suspension last month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded last March following two fatal crashes. The coronavirus, which has killed hundreds in China and infected thousands globally, is expected to disrupt supply chains, especially for electronics producers.
The economy grew 2.3% last year, the slowest since 2016, after expanding 2.9% in 2018.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry increased to a reading of 56.2 in January from 55.3 in December. Order backlogs, however, continued to contract in January, which could curb growth in the services sector.
The survey's index for services industry employment slipped to a reading of 53.1 last month from 54.8 in December. This is in line with slowing job growth, both as workers become more scarce and demand for labor cools.
The economy created 2.1 million jobs in 2019, the least since 2011 and down from 2.7 million in 2018. Growth in consumer spending slowed considerably in the final three months of 2019."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada posted a narrower-than-expected trade deficit of C$370 million ($279 million) in December, largely on higher crude exports, official data showed on Wednesday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a shortfall of C$610 million. Statscan revised the November deficit to C$1.20 billion from an initial C$1.09 billion. 
The value of exports increased 1.9% in December to C$49.32 billion, with gains in eight of the 11 product sections tracked by Statscan. Imports edged up 0.2%, with advances in five of the 11 product sections. 
""It's a nice bounce back, a modest bounce back in what was a very challenging year for Canadian exports in 2019,"" said Ross Prusakowski, principal economist with Export Development Canada, in a phone interview.
""We saw the recovery from the transportation challenges that we had in November with the rail strike as well as the pipeline outage, so it's obvious the recovery is there, especially on the energy side,"" he said.
The Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.3283, or 75.28 U.S. cents, after the data was released.
Statscan said exports of energy products jumped 9.5% in December, with crude oil exports surging 18.0% following the repair of a rupture in the Keystone pipeline in North Dakota.
Canada's ongoing trade row with China, that has seen Beijing block Canadian canola seed exports because of disputed pest concerns, also appeared to be taking a toll. 
Statscan said on Wednesday overall exports to China were down 16.0% in 2019, the first annual decline since 2014, largely on lower canola and soybean shipments. 
Meanwhile, Canadian exports to the United States rose 2.9%, mainly due to crude exports, while imports from the United States were down 0.2%, the fourth consecutive monthly decline. 
Statscan said Canada's trade surplus with the United States, its largest trading partner, widened to C$5.2 billion in December.
About 75% of Canada's goods exports are sent to the United States.
The Bank of Canada has held its overnight interest steady for more than a year even as several of its counterparts have eased, but in January left the door open to a possible rate cut if a recent slowdown in domestic growth persists.
Market expectations, as reflected in the overnight index swaps markets, show operators expect the Bank to hold rates again in March. [BOCWATCH]

1291,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 05, 2020 09:13AM ET</span>","Companies in U.S. Add Most Workers Since May 2015, ADP Says","(Bloomberg) -- Companies in the U.S. ramped up hiring at the start of the year, taking on the most workers since May 2015 and indicating the labor market remains robust, a report on private payrolls showed Wednesday.
Employment at businesses increased by 291,000 in January after a revised 199,000 gain in the previous month, according to data from the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute. The surge in hiring, which partly reflected the benefits of warmer weather, exceeded all economists’ forecasts in a Bloomberg survey that called for a 157,000 gain. The dollar strengthened and Treasury yields rose after the report.
Key Insights
The larger-than-expected gain was broad-based and included the biggest advance in service industry payrolls since February 2016, including a record surge in hiring at leisure and hospitality companies in data back to 2002.The report is in line with last week’s statement from Federal Reserve policy makers following their meeting on interest rates. The Fed said that “job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months.”Economists monitor the ADP data for clues about the government’s job report. The Labor Department’s employment data due Friday is expected to show a 150,000 gain in private payrolls and an unemployment rate remaining at a 50-year-low of 3.5%.The government figures will also include annual revisions. In August, the Labor Department’s preliminary benchmark projections showed the number of workers added to payrolls will probably be revised down by 501,000 in the year through March 2019.

“Mild winter weather provided a significant boost to the January employment gain,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said in a statement. Moody’s produces the report jointly with ADP. “The leisure and hospitality and construction industries in particular experienced an outsized increase in jobs. Abstracting from the vagaries of the data underlying job growth is close to 125,000 per month, which is consistent with low and stable unemployment.”

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.9 January, a full point higher than a preliminary reading for the month and up from 50.0 in December.
It was the strongest reading since September 2018 and came in above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a reading of 52.9.
Last week, the Bank of England said it saw signs of a post-election pick-up in growth as its policymakers voted against an immediate interest rate cut to help the lackluster economy, which slowed to a near-crawl in late 2019.
Data company IHS Markit, which produces the PMI, stuck to its view that the economy looks on track for quarterly growth of around 0.2% at the start of this year.
The survey showed new business in services companies grew last month at the fastest rate since June 2018.
""January's PMI surveys give a clear signal that the UK economy has picked up since the general election, as a diminishing headwind from political uncertainty translated into rising business and consumer spending,"" IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said.
Brexit anxieties could still cloud the outlook before Dec. 31, when Britain's new trading relationship with the European Union is due to start.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pitched two models for his country's trade ties with the EU after Brexit: preferably a deal based on the EU's accord with Canada or, failing that, the basic terms that the bloc has with Australia -- with business groups opposed to the latter approach.
For now, the signs of growth appear clear.
The services PMI's gauge of business expectations rose to its highest level since May 2015.
""However, this sub-index was the only measure in the final UK Services PMI dataset to drop since the earlier 'flash' estimate, which may suggest that business expectations tailed off towards the end of the month,"" Williamson said.
The composite PMI, which combines the services and manufacturing output indexes, rose in January to 53.3 from the earlier flash reading for the month of 52.4 and December's 49.3, hitting its highest level since September 2018."

The fall was led by a drop of nearly 14% in private consumers' car purchases, while business sales were more resilient, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.
""The new car market is a key driver of the UK's overall economy, so another month of decline is unsettling. Consumer confidence is not returning to the market,"" SMMT CEO Mike Hawes said."

IHS Markit's final euro zone composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good indicator of economic health, rose to a five-month high of 51.3 in January from December's 50.9.
That beat a preliminary estimate which suggested no change from the previous month but remained close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""A further rise in the headline PMI to the highest since last August adds to evidence that the tide may be turning for the euro zone economy,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Williamson said the PMI pointed to quarterly GDP growth of 0.2%, in line with the latest Reuters poll prediction. However, the data were largely collected before the coronavirus outbreak spread further beyond China's borders, which has raised risks to global growth.
Demand strengthened last month. The new business index rose to 51.3 from 50.6, prompting firms to hire staff at a faster rate than they did in December.
A sister survey on Monday suggested the worst may be over for factories in the region too. But possibly of concern to policymakers, the PMI for the bloc's dominant service industry slipped a bit to 52.5 from 52.8.
Services firms were at their most optimistic since April. The business expectations index rose to 61.9 from 60.7."

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.2 from 52.9 in December, matching a flash reading and remaining above the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction, as it has since May 2013.
The survey also showed new business expanded for the second month running and that the pace of employment in the sector hit a seven-month high.
""Germany's service sector made a bright start to the new year, which provides some welcome reassurance that the domestic economy has, by and large, remained resilient to the weakness in manufacturing,"" said IHS Markit's principal economist Phil Smith.
""Moreover, it bodes well for domestic demand that service providers stepped up the rate of job creation in January, though overall job gains continued to be limited by the staff cuts across manufacturing.""
The final composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to 51.2, the second successive month of expansion. That was slightly above a flash reading of 51.1."

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector fell to 51.0 in January from 52.4 in December, its slowest rise in nine months.
A reading of above 50 points signals an expansion in activity compared to a contraction.
IHS Markit's overall composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, fell to 51.1 in January from 52.0 in December.
Data at the end of last month showed that France's economy had unexpectedly shrunk in the final quarter of 2019, as output slumped in the face of strikes over an unpopular pension reform.
""The French private sector began 2020 with a sluggish performance, as growth in both output and new orders eased to their slowest since September,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
Kerr said January's PMI results pointed to economic growth of around 0.2%.
""The weakness stemmed from the service sector, where a softer expansion in activity more than offset a quicker rise in manufacturing production. Similarly, dampened new business growth in services outweighed a rebound in manufacturing,"" added Kerr."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark interest rate for a third time in six months on Wednesday, taking it to a record low as a virus spreading from China puts further pressure on the struggling economy.
The Bank of Thailand's (BOT) monetary policy committee voted unanimously to cut the one-day repurchase rate by 25 basis point to a fresh record low of 1.0%, the lowest in Asia outside of Japan.
""The Committee viewed that the Thai economy would expand at a slower rate in 2020 than previously forecasted and much further below its potential,"" the MPC said in a statement.
The virus outbreak, a drought and a delay in passing the fiscal budget would affect a large number of businesses and employment, it said.
Analysts say potential growth shocks emanating from China are raising the chances of further central bank policy easing in Asia.
The Bank of Japan's deputy governor said earlier on Wednesday that it stands ready to ramp up stimulus if the economy is derailed, while several others have said they are closely monitoring the situation. The Philippines is expected to lower borrowing costs on Thursday.
Thailand is considered one of the most vulnerable economies in the region to the virus due to its heavy reliance on Chinese tourists and China trade.
The unanimous decision to cut the rate ""underscores the severity and urgency of economic challenges,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research of Kasikornbank.
Charnon Boonnuch, an economist at Nomura in Singapore, said he expected the BOT to pause after three rate cuts of 75 basis points in this cycle.
""However, we see some room for more easing this year if growth continues to disappoint. There is still some room for the BOT to cut,"" he added.
In a Reuters poll, 14 of 23 economists had predicted no rate change on Wednesday while the others forecast a quarter-point cut.
The BOT had cut the rate by a quarter-point each in August and November but left it unchanged in December.

Titanun Mallikamas, secretary of the BOT's monetary policy committee, told a news conference that the economy was expected to grow less than the forecast 2.8% this year.
Tourism in particular will likely be much slower than expected, he said.
Titanun did not answer when asked whether there was room to cut rates further.
The virus outbreak - which has sickened thousands in China and killed nearly 500 people - has compounded problems for Southeast Asia's second-largest economy as its exports have been weak amid global trade tensions.
Revenues from tourism, another key growth driver, are expected to plummet after China banned tour groups from leaving the country to contain the spread of the disease.
Thailand may see 2 million fewer Chinese tourists than last year's 11 million, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand. China is Thailand's biggest source of tourists, making up 28% of the total last year.
A joint standing committee of industry, banking and commerce said on Wednesday the country's tourism earnings may tumble by 108 billion baht to 220 billion baht ($3.47 billion-$7.08 billion) if the outbreak lasts for 3-6 months.
It also slashed its 2020 economic growth forecast to 2.0%-2.5% from 2.5%-3.0% projected last month.
In addition, some investments have been stalled due to delays in the 3.2 trillion baht budget, which is now pending a court ruling on its validity.

The headline Business Activity index in Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.3 from December's 54.9.
The index has held above the 50 line separating growth from contraction for more than six years. January's reading is the lowest since November 2013.
Firms in the services sector, which accounts for around half of Spain's economic output, reported lower activity last month and said sales increased at the slowest pace since September 2013, IHS Markit said.
Firms reported concerns linked to the formation of the new government and its as-yet unknown impact on economic activity, notably on wages, regulation and taxes.
""Political uncertainties were widely reported by the survey panel to be negatively influencing decision-making, leading to a stalling of decisions around investment and hiring,"" Paul Smith, Economics Director at IHS Markit, said.
The data is another sign that Spain's economic slowdown is likely to extend well into 2020. The economy has outperformed most of the euro zone for the past few years but lost some pace last year.
According to a sister survey, Spain's manufacturing sector contracted for the eighth month in a row in January, although at a slower pace than in December.
An uptick in unemployment numbers in January confirmed the economic slowdown."

The results would likely bring some relief for markets and policymakers after only modest spending increases in a recent budget had disappointed investors looking for more robust stimulus to support a stuttering economy.
The Nikkei/IHS Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.5 in January from December's 53.3. It was the highest reading since January 2013 and above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction for a third straight month.
""The Indian service sector sprung to life at the start of 2020, defying expectations of fragility and building on to the momentum gained at the end of 2019,"" Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit, said in a release.
""With business revenues rising, service providers continued to increase capacity to meet further strong growth in sales. This is good news for jobseekers, particularly when we consider the results from the manufacturing industry which showed the steepest upturn in employment since August 2012.""
A sub-index tracking new business also climbed to its highest since January 2013, encouraging firms to maintain a strong hiring rate.
Yet, not everything was rosy. New export business - a proxy of foreign demand - contracted last month, falling to its lowest since May 2018 on weaker demand from China, the United States and Europe. Pressure could heighten further amid growing global risks from China's coronavirus epidemic which has rapidly spread to other countries and claimed nearly 500 lives, nearly all in mainland China.
Moreover, prices charged by service firms increased at the fastest pace in nearly two years after a sharper rise in input costs forced businesses to transfer some of the inflationary pressure to consumers.
That suggests overall inflation could remain above the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4%, making it difficult for the central bank to ease monetary policy further.
""One worrying development, however, was the trend for inflation. This may translate into quicker increases in selling prices in months to come, which may curb sales,"" De Lima said.
""Firms could also choose to restrict hiring in order to protect profit margins.""
Service providers remained optimistic about growth in the year ahead, although the expectations index remained well below the long-term average.
A sister survey on Monday showed factory activity accelerated at the fastest pace in eight years last month which, along with the strong expansion in services activity, pushed a composite index to 56.3, its highest since January 2013."

Exports from the world's second-largest economy are expected to have dropped 4.8% in January from a year earlier, according to a median estimate from the survey of 18 economists, compared with a 7.9% gain in December and marking the steepest fall since February 2019.
Imports likely fell 6% from a year earlier in January, a sharp contrast with 16.5% growth in the previous month.
The drop was likely due to seasonal distortions caused by the long Lunar New Year holidays, when business activity typically slows, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said. The holiday fell in February last year.
The impact of the virus on trade will start to show in February data, the analysts said. Nearly 500 people in China have died in the outbreak so far, with over 24,000 infected.
In a bid to contain the virus, authorities have implemented widespread curbs on transportation and other tough public health measures that are already weighing heavily on the travel, tourism and retail sectors. Analysts are forecasting a sharp drop in first-quarter economic growth.
Most firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which began on Jan. 24 this year. This year, China's government extended the holidays to limit the spread of the virus, and it is not clear when millions of migrant workers will be able to return to factory floors.
Many Chinese exporters say they're facing difficulty in fulfilling overseas orders for February as companies are unsure when they will resume production.
""So far 14 provinces and cities across China, including main industrial centers of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Fujian have told businesses not to reopen until at least Feb. 10...These places account for around 70% of China's GDP and 80% of its exports,"" analysts with Capital Economics said in a note, adding that extended factory closures would affect supply chains in the rest of Asia.
The disruptions are already rippling through global supply lines from Asia all the way to New Zealand and the United States.
Hyundai Motor said on Tuesday it will suspend production in South Korea because the outbreak has disrupted the supply of parts from China. In addition, many airlines have canceled passenger flights to China, impacting air freight.
The manager of a state-backed logistics firm in Ningbo said that the waiting time has swelled to ""at least four days"" to unload river barges due to staffing shortages.
Economists from UBS have lowered their forecasts for China's annual merchandise export growth to 1.3% from 2.0% and for import growth to 3.2% from 3.6% in 2020.
The White House's top economic adviser said on Tuesday that the outbreak would delay a surge in U.S. exports to China expected from the Phase 1 trade deal set to take effect later this month.
But Larry Kudlow said it would not have a catastrophic effect on business supply chains.
With the risks of the epidemic to China's economic growth mounting, the central bank is likely to lower its key lending rate - the loan prime rate (LPR) - on Feb. 20, and cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) in the coming weeks, Reuters reported on Tuesday citing sources.
The sources also said Chinese policymakers are debating whether to lower the planned 2020 economic growth target of around 6%, which many private sector economists see as well beyond China's reach at this point."

""Although less upbeat regarding future business activity growth, service providers registered a stronger increase in output in January,"" said Sian Jones, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Nevertheless, underlying data signaled challenging demand conditions, less motivation to expand workforce numbers and a decline in charges amid efforts to stay competitive.""
Output charges decreased for the first time in a decade with companies noting that efforts to remain competitive and secure clients drove output prices lower.
Business confidence in the services sector continued to rise, but optimism dipped to its lowest since December 2016 amid uncertainty regarding the stability of future demand conditions, IHS Markit said.

Gross domestic product rose 5.02% last year, broadly in line with the 5.04% forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists, according to data released Wednesday. Fourth-quarter growth of 4.97% was the slowest since late 2016, below the median estimate of 5% in the survey.​
“We continue to maintain our view that domestic demand has been weak, and we see little impetus for it to turn around meaningfully,” said Mohamed Faiz Nagutha, an economist with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in Singapore. “As such, policy support -- from both fiscal and monetary sides -- remains appropriate.”
He expects the central bank to cut interest rates by 50 basis points this year. Bank Indonesia lowered its key rate four times since July, and left it unchanged last month.
Speaking at another venue Wednesday, Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo pledged to maintain an accommodative stance this year and said easing would not be limited to lowering the benchmark rate.
Downside Risks
Manufacturing was under pressure throughout last year, Suhariyanto, head of the government statistics agency, told reporters Wednesday. Exports contracted 0.39% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, and 0.87% for the full year.
Growth in consumer spending, which makes up 57% of the economy, slowed to 4.97% in the fourth quarter, while government expenditure slowed to 0.48%. Investment growth declined to 4.06%.
“Growth is uninspiring, especially if you compare with peers like the Philippines,” said Euben Paracuelles, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “This should support the case for BI to more than maintain an accommodative stance and eventually cut its policy rate, especially with still limited signs the government is making budget revisions with some meaningful fiscal stimulus.”
The government is projecting growth of 5.3% this year, but officials say there are downside risks to the forecast because of the coronavirus crisis.
“While domestic consumption has been a bulwark to stabilize things, if Indonesia does not boost investment soon, sub-5% growth in 2020 cannot be ruled out,” said Wellian Wiranto, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's central bank on Wednesday raised the bar for further easing in monetary policy, saying it would consider cutting interest rates if the unemployment rate moved higher and inflation stayed tepid.
The unemployment rate eased to 5.1% in December while the latest data showed inflation had ticked higher in the final quarter of last year, implying no urgency to lower rates for now.
""It's possible that interest rates could come down but I’m hoping that does not happen,"" Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe said in Sydney, responding to questions from journalists.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) slashed its cash rate three times last year to an all-time low of 0.75%. At its first meeting of 2020 on Tuesday, it sat on its hands while sounding doggedly upbeat about the economic outlook.
""It is possible to have a period of stability"" on interest rates, Lowe added signaling a neutral bias on policy.
The remarks were enough for investors to push back the probability of interest rate cuts this year while three-year bond yields (AU3YT=RR) jumped nine basis points from an all-time low to reach 0.71%.
Financial futures are now pricing in a full 25-basis-point cut in August from June earlier while there is only a one-in-five chance of a second cut later in the year.
""It seems that having taken interest rates to a record low, the RBA is very much back in the mode of being patient rather than doing more to push unemployment down faster,"" ANZ economist David Plank said.
""This potentially pushes the timing of the next rate cut out considerably,"" he added.
Plank stuck to his forecast for a cut in April, saying the risks to the economy from raging bushfires at home and a fast spreading virus in China were ""very much to the downside.""
The RBA estimated the fires will shave around 0.2 percentage points off gross domestic product growth across the December 2019 and March 2020 quarters though an expected pick-up from rebuilding later in the year would help the economy.
Lowe identified the coronavirus outbreak as a new uncertainty hanging over the outlook, although he said it was too early to gauge the overall impact.
For now, the RBA kept its forecasts for GDP growth intact, predicting a 2.75% expansion over this year and 3% next year.
Lowe said the board is ""continually"" looking at the benefits as well as the costs and risks associated with very low interest rates.
""If the unemployment rate were to be trending in the wrong direction and there was no further progress being made toward the inflation target, the balance of arguments would change,"" he said.
""In those circumstances, the Board would see a stronger case for further monetary easing,"" Lowe added.
The RBA will release its updated quarterly economic outlook on Friday when Lowe and other senior RBA officials will be grilled by lawmakers in parliament."

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine January inflation picked up more than expected to an eight-month peak, but the outcome is still within the central bank's comfort range and supports views it will likely cut interest rates when it meets on Thursday.
The consumer price index (CPI) in January rose 2.9% from a year earlier, the statistics agency said on Wednesday, the highest since May 2019, due to increases in the cost of food, clothing, transport and utilities.
A Reuters poll had forecast the CPI in January would rise 2.8% from a year earlier, within the central bank's 2.5%-3.3% forecast range for the month, and more than the previous month's 2.5% increase.
""This is consistent with the BSP's prevailing assessment that inflation is expected to gradually approach the midpoint of the target range in 2020 and 2021,"" Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Benjamin Diokno said in a tweet.
The annual core inflation rate was 3.3% in January compared with December's 3.1%.
The data was released a day before the central bank meets, where it is widely expected to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% to buttress the economy against the negative impact of the spreading virus outbreak.
""Inflation pop in January (was) induced by transitory factors and we expect the central bank to carry out its rate cut on Thursday despite the slightly higher inflation print,"" ING Economist Nicholas Mapa said.
The central bank has a 2%-4% inflation target for this year.
It kept rates on hold at its meetings in November and December as the outlook improved on the back of higher government spending and strong domestic demand.
Governor Diokno said last week the central bank was still eyeing at least a 50 basis point cut in policy rates this year to further unwind the total 175 basis points of rate hikes in 2018 to control red-hot inflation.
The government has set a 6.5%-7.5% growth target for the year, but disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak which began in China and is spreading to other countries poses risks to Manila's growth outlook."
1306,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 08:56PM ET</span>",China's services sector growth hits three-month low in January: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's services sector slowed for a second straight month in January, a traditionally busy sales season, hitting a three-month low as companies cut prices and new orders dipped, a private sector survey showed on Wednesday.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) slowed to 51.8 last month from 52.5 in December, but was still higher than an 8-month low hit in October.
The slowdown in growth suggests the services sector, which accounts for more than half of the economy, faces persistent challenges despite a flurry of stimulus and a U.S.-China trade ""Phase 1"" deal. The reading is also unlikely to reflect the early impact of the coronavirus crisis that flared in late January, which could weigh heavily on growth.
""China's economic recovery was not strong enough due to limited improvement in demand, and some companies didn't replenish inventories,"" Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, wrote in a note accompanying the Caixin PMI release.
The index has stayed above the 50-point margin that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis since late 2005. Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to cushion a prolonged slowdown in manufacturing and investment and create jobs for workers laid-off in other areas.
Economic growth has cooled to near 30-year lows amid sluggish demand at home and abroad.
The cooling trend in the private sector survey, which focuses more on small, export-oriented companies, contrasts with the official non-manufacturing PMI, which showed the sector's activity quickened in January.
Services companies reported a smaller rise in the volume of new work in January and continued to face higher fuel and labor costs. Demand softened at home, while new orders from overseas picked up modestly from the previous month.
The pace of job creation almost stalled, with the employment sub-index hitting the lowest level in 16 months. Meanwhile, firms had to lower their selling prices for the second time, squeezing companies' profit margins.
But their expectations regarding the one-year outlook for business activity improved notably in the month, as the ""Phase 1"" trade deal with the United States eased some of the pressure on exporters.
However, a coronavirus outbreak that has abruptly limited the movement of millions of people and forced the closures of restaurants, malls, and movie theaters across the country during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, is likely to further darken the outlook for China's slowing economy.
Analysts have noted the deepening coronavirus crisis, which is expected to be as much as two or three times worse than the SARS outbreak, will potentially add to industry headaches.
""As during the SARS episode, we expect consumption and travel to take the hardest hit,"" Analysts at Oxford Economics said in a note.
""But we also expect that there will be significant disruption to other economic activities, though to a lesser degree than the impact on consumption.""
Analysts like CEBM Group's Zhong have urged policymakers to take swift action to cushion to hit to growth from the virus.
""As the current pneumonia epidemic is putting pressure on the economy, policymakers need to make efforts to ensure no major disruptions to improving business confidence,"" he said.

While it is early days, the uptick will be welcome news for the Bank of Japan as it pins its hopes on a domestic demand-led economic recovery even as global policymakers fret over a new threat to world growth from China's coronavirus epidemic.
The final seasonally adjusted Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.0 in January from a more than three-year low of 49.4 in December, but below a preliminary reading of 52.1.
It marked the fastest pace of growth since last September, and was above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion.
The PMI data showed a jump in new business to its highest since June last year, and stronger service sector employment and higher selling prices.
""Stronger growth in demand and employment instill some confidence that short-term economic prospects are not as bad as feared at the end of last year,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""That said, business confidence dropped to a 29-month low in January, with concern towards the aging working population and low-growth environment restricting expectations in the year ahead.""
Business expectations dropped to their lowest since August 2017, while backlogs of work remained in contraction for the second straight month, suggesting the world's third-largest economy is likely to remain under pressure for the time being.
A preliminary trade deal between the United States and China had raised hopes globally of a relenting in the pressure facing businesses worldwide, especially export-led nations like Japan.
The coming months might prove critical to the outlook as investors count the cost of China's virus outbreak.
Many analysts expect Japan's economy to have shrunk in the quarter through December last year largely due to the fallout from last October's sales tax hike, after it grew an annualized 1.8% in the third quarter.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, rebounded in January after seeing the fastest pace of decline since April 2014 in the previous month.
The index advanced to 50.1 from December's final 48.6, expanding for the first time in four months."

The drop in inflation came after the government last year unexpectedly relaxed 15 years of stringent economic regulation, abandoning enforcement of price controls and allowing dollar transactions in the face of runaway inflation and U.S. sanctions. The country is in its sixth year of recession.
The government has also sharply curtailed circulation of the local bolivar currency, which has helped limit prices but left many individuals and businesses struggling to obtain bolivars.

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>",Defense aircraft demand lifts U.S. factory orders; underlying softness remains,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased by the most in nearly 1-1/2 years in December, flattered by robust demand for defense aircraft, but persistently weak business spending on equipment pointed to limited scope for a sharp rebound in manufacturing.
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday followed on the heels of a survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Monday showing manufacturing activity rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months.
The business investment downturn could be compounded by Boeing's (N:BA) suspension last month of production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded last March after two fatal crashes, and the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed hundreds in China and infected thousands globally. These events are seen disrupting supply chains.
""The strength in (factory orders) is a little misleading,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Fundamentals haven't improved significantly for either manufacturing or real business equipment spending."" 
Factory goods orders surged 1.8% in December, the largest gain since August 2018. Data for November was revised down to show orders tumbling 1.2% instead of dropping 0.7% as previously reported. Excluding defense, factory orders dropped 0.6% in December after edging up 0.1% in the prior month. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would increase 1.2% in December.
Factory orders fell 0.6% in 2019. While business sentiment has improved as trade tensions between the United States and China have eased, confidence remains subdued. Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal last month, but U.S. tariffs on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total, remained in place. 
Underlying weakness in manufacturing was underscored by a 0.5% jump in inventories at factories in December. That was the biggest increase in factory inventories since last January and followed a 0.3% rise in November. 
The inventory bloat indicates sluggish sales at factories, though shipments increased 0.5% in December, the most since September 2018. Unfilled orders at factories were unchanged. 
U.S. stocks rose for a second straight day as measures by the Chinese government to contain the coronavirus and limit its economic fallout lifted demand for riskier assets. The dollar (DXY) firmed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BOEING, CORONAVIRUS DRAG
The 18-month-long U.S.-China trade war has pressured business confidence and undercut capital expenditure. Business investment contracted in the fourth quarter for the third straight quarter, the longest such stretch since 2009. 
Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. The U.S. economy grew 2.3% in 2019, the slowest in three years, after expanding 2.9% in 2018.
The coronavirus outbreak could hurt global growth, which has been stabilizing after declining since mid-2018. It is seen disrupting the supply chain for technology companies like Apple (O:AAPL) which source their components from China.
""The toll on U.S. manufacturing production is likely to be borne most heavily in the computer and electronics industry given its reliance on Chinese-made inputs as well as its relatively high share of industrial production,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Well Fargo Securities in Charlotte North Carolina.
Transportation equipment orders surged 7.9% in December, the biggest increase since August 2018, after plunging 8.2% in the prior month. Orders were boosted by a 168.3% jump in demand for defense aircraft and parts, which offset a 74.7% tumble in orders for civilian aircraft and parts. Motor vehicle and parts orders increased 0.5% in December.
But machinery orders fell 1.0% in December after dropping 1.2% in November. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components orders decreased 0.3% in December.
The government also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, dropped 0.8% in December instead of deceasing 0.9% as reported last month.

Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, declined 0.3% in December, rather than falling 0.4% as previously reported.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Trade confidence among Canadian exporters fell to its lowest level in nearly a decade, Canada's export credit agency said on Tuesday, as businesses wrestle with protectionist policies and fret about the global economy.
In its biannual survey of 1,000 Canadian exporters, Export Development Canada (EDC) said its trade confidence index fell to 69.3% - the lowest level since 2012 and 6% below the survey's historical average. 
""The results, an eight-year low in confidence, suggest a soft start is likely for Canada's exports in 2020,"" Stephen Tapp, EDC's deputy chief economist, said in a statement. 
""Protectionism and concern about the global economy are key issues weighing on the minds of Canadian exporters.""
Thirty percent of exporters polled said protectionism was affecting their global strategies, while nearly 90% said they expected protectionism to either stay the same or increase in 2020, the survey found. 
""Trade barriers are now the No. 1 challenge, cited as a bigger problem than perennial issues, like finding skilled talent, logistics and financing,"" Tapp said.
Meanwhile, 34% of respondents said they had been negatively affected by the U.S.-China trade dispute.
The national telephone survey of small, medium and large-sized companies was conducted between Nov. 18 and Dec. 15, before the United States and China agreed to an initial Phase 1 trade deal in mid-January.
Closer to home, more than three-quarters of respondents told EDC they expect United States-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) to be ratified. The pending trade deal will update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Only 16% of respondents expressed a negative assessment of the deal, down from 34% in the previous survey, EDC said.
Canada, which sends about 75% of its goods to the United States, is the only one of the three signatories to not have formally blessed the USMCA deal. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose minority Liberal government no longer controls the House of Commons, has urged parliament to ratify the deal quickly.

Tapp said both the initial Phase 1 trade deal between China and the United States as well as the expected ratification of the USMCA ""will reduce trade uncertainty and provide a welcome reprieve for Canadian exporters.""

Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro dropped by 0.7% year-on-year in December, after a 1.4% plunge in November, in line with market expectations.
The slowdown in industry deflation was mostly caused by a less prominent fall in energy prices, which declined by 4.0% in December after a 6.1% drop in November.
Without that volatile component, industrial producer prices rose 0.5% in December, up from 0.3% in November.
Prices of non-durable consumer goods, such as clothing, went up by 2.1% on the year. Durable consumer goods, like fridges or cars, recorded a 1.3% inflation at factory gates.
On the month, overall industry prices were flat in December, after a 0.1% rise in November, confirming market forecasts.
Producer prices signal inflationary pressure early in the pipeline because, unless absorbed by intermediaries and retailers, changes are transmitted to the final consumer, impacting headline inflation.
The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation below, but close to 2% over the medium term, but has struggled to accelerate price growth for years despite programs of government bond buying on the market.
Euro zone headline inflation accelerated to 1.4% in January on the year from 1.3% in December, preliminary estimates from Eurostat showed last week [nL8N2A0355]."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's retail sales extended their freefall in December as months of often violent anti-government protests scared off tourists and shoppers, hitting spending and threatening the survival of many businesses.
Over the festive period, protesters roamed through prime shopping malls and clashed with police, forcing many stores to close early on repeated occasions.
Retail sales in December fell 19.4% from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, against a revised 23.7% drop in November and a 24.4% fall in October, which was the steepest on record.
For the whole of 2019, sales fell 11.1% from a year earlier to HK$431.2 billion ($55.51 billion). Volume fell 12.3%.
Analysts say the figures are likely to get worse in coming months as a new coronavirus outbreak in mainland China has emptied shopping centers and closed down tourist attractions. Hong Kong, which relies heavily on spending by mainland visitors, has taken measures to reduce the flow of people crossing the border.
Retail sales fell to HK$36.2 billion in December, the 11th consecutive month of decline. In volume terms, retail sales in December fell 21.0%, compared with a revised 25.5% drop in November.
""The business environment for retail trade has become even more difficult recently, with the threat of the novel coronavirus infection heavily weighing on inbound tourism and local consumption sentiment,"" a government spokesman said.
Hong Kong sank into recession for the first time in a decade last year, as the city plunged into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
TOURISM HIT
Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong plunged 51.5% year-on-year in December, compared with a 55.9% plunge in November, which was the steepest fall since May 2003 - when the city was hit by an outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic.
December tourist arrivals fell to 3.2 million, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board.
The number of mainland visitors fell 53.2% in December to 2.4 million.
Many businesses have felt the pain, especially some of the city's large luxury retailers who rely heavily on mainland Chinese spending, as the protests show no signs of easing.
Sales of jewelry, watches, clocks and valuable gifts plunged 36.7% on-year in December, compared with a 43.5% drop in November, data showed. Medicines and cosmetics fell 29.9%, while department store sales dropped 25.3%.
The Hong Kong Retail Management Association (HKRMA) estimates about 7,000 businesses, or more than one in 10 retailers, will be forced to close in the next six months. HKRMA has urged landlords to cut rents."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 48.4 from 44.4 in December, still showing a decline in output but rebounding by more than the Reuters poll forecast of 46.6 and reaching its highest level since May.
The last time the construction PMI rose by more in one month was in April 2018 when the sector was recovering from the ""Beast from the East"" winter storms earlier that year.
Some survey respondents said the reduction in political uncertainty after the Dec. 12 election might unlock new projects and boost client spending.
Johnson's win meant he was able to move ahead with taking Britain out of the EU on Jan. 31, whereas the opposition Labour Party proposed a second referendum on Brexit which would have extended the uncertainty for months.
Also, many business leaders were worried about Labour's plans to nationalize some industries and exert more state control over the economy.
The PMI showed construction companies were the most optimistic about their growth prospects since April 2018.
""Anecdotal evidence suggested that greater clarity in relation to Brexit following the general election had a positive impact on demand, especially in the residential development category,"" survey compiler IHS Markit said.
There have been other signs that Johnson's election victory has boosted business confidence in Britain, at least for now, before potentially tense talks on a new trade deal with the EU which must be settled before a deadline of Dec. 31.
Last week, the Bank of England held off from cutting interest rates while it waited to see if the improvement in sentiment translates into stronger economic growth.
It published a survey on Monday showing output in Britain's manufacturing sector emerged last month from its longest decline since the financial crisis, reaching the no-change level of 50.0 in January."

Taiwan is one of Asia's major exporters, especially of technology goods, and its export trend is a key gauge of global demand for technology gadgets worldwide.

The trade-reliant island's inflation rate in January is estimated to stand at 1.25%, the highest since September 2018, according to the median forecast of 14 analysts surveyed by Reuters.
Taiwan's growth outlook has improved, boosted by recovering global demand for electronics and factory relocations as some manufacturers move factories from China back to Taiwan to avoid higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made goods.
The island's economy grew at the fastest pace in one-and-a-half years in the fourth quarter of 2019, after its two largest trading partners - China and the United States - signed a Phase 1 trade agreement last month after a bruising tariff war.

Exports of fresh fruits and vegetables will be the worst hit, Ghanyapad Tantipipatpong, group chairwoman of Thai National Shippers' Council, told reporters.
China was Thailand's second-largest export market last year, purchasing goods worth $29.2 billion, or 11.8% of total Thai exports.
The group has maintained its forecast for overall export growth of 0-1% this year, as the virus is expected to cut shipments by just 0.11%, Ghanyapad said, adding that it expects exports to China to accelerate due to pent-up demand.

Governor Philip Lowe kept the cash rate at 0.75% at the Reserve Bank’s first meeting of 2020, as predicted by most economists and traders. The jobless rate falling in the final two months of 2019 kept the RBA sidelined, despite the impending hit from wildfires and now the coronavirus.
The coronavirus “is having a significant effect on the Chinese economy at present. It is too early to determine how long-lasting the impact will be,” Lowe said in a statement announcing the decision. “The board will continue to monitor developments carefully, including in the labor market. It remains prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed.”
The Australian dollar rose, trading at 67.15 U.S. cents at 2:36 p.m. in Sydney, from 66.86 before the decision.
Australia’s economic fortunes are heavily dependent on the world’s number 2 economy: China buys one-third of Australian goods and services. Halting flights to limit the spread of the Coronavirus will strike at the heart of the education and tourism sectors, some of the nation’s most valuable exports. A slowing Chinese economy also has less need for iron ore, and the price is tumbling accordingly.
Yet, the RBA’s capacity to cushion the shock with easing monetary policy is questionable. Indeed, doing so could cause more harm than good.
The central bank lowered interest rates three times between June and October as it sought to buttress the economy. While the property market revived, consumer confidence sagged as households were spooked by the signal the cuts sent about the growth outlook.
The economy’s traditional shock absorber -- the exchange rate -- has answered and is down almost 4% in the past month.
The RBA releases its updated quarterly forecasts Friday in the Statement on Monetary Policy and many economists expect near-term gross domestic product will be cut as a result of the wildfires and now the virus in China. Fire reconstruction will boost growth in future quarters as well as the government’s loosened purse strings.
Lowe will have plenty of opportunity this week to elaborate on the RBA’s current stance, with a major speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday and three hours of parliamentary testimony on Friday. The latter will take place concurrently with the release of the Statement on Monetary Policy."

The IHS Markit Egypt Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the non-oil private sector slid to 46.0 in January from 48.2 in December, well below the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
""Firms squarely linked this to falling sales, with customers increasingly cautious about their expenditure and new contracts dwindling,"" IHS Markit economist David Owen said. ""This led to softer output, reduced employment and a marked drop in overall purchases.""
The January reading was the worst since the months immediately following a November 2016 IMF-backed economic reform plan that included a halving of the value of Egypt's currency, a sharp increase in fuel prices and the imposition of a 13% value-added tax.
It was also the sixth consecutive month of decline for private non-oil business activity. Activity has expanded in only six of the last 54 months, according to the PMI.
The January survey said output at Egyptian firms contracted sharply, as did new orders.
""Employment and purchases were also down solidly, leading to only a slight uptick in input costs and driving firms to offer discounts for the third month in a row,"" the survey said.
Export orders received by the non-oil companies shrank for a fourth successive month, with the index registering 38.5, its lowest reading in three and a half years.
""Softer trade conditions reportedly led to less foreign contracts,"" the survey said. ""Moreover, the latest decline was steep and the fastest observed since October 2016.""

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, fell to 49.3 in January from 50.2 in December. Readings above 50 indicate expansion while readings below point to contraction.
Growth in the country's non-oil private sector slowed last year, hitting a decade-low in December, but January was the first time the private sector shrank since 2009, when the economy was hobbled by a debt crisis in Dubai - one of the seven emirates.
""The IHS Markit UAE PMI continued to worsen in January, and this month fell below the 50.0 mark that separates growth from contraction for the first time in over ten years,"" said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit and author of the report.
Economic growth in the UAE has been sluggish, especially in Dubai, which is also suffering from a property downturn and severe cuts in white-collar jobs.
Demand slipped in January, with total new orders falling for the second time in three months, and firms struggled to improve sales, particularly within the domestic economy, the survey said.
""Key to the decline were firms' efforts to reduce employment at one of the fastest rates on record in order to streamline costs,"" Owen said. The employment sub-index fell to 48.8 in January from 50.3 in December.
The governments of Dubai and Abu Dhabi have boosted spending to provide stimulus to their economies, and the International Monetary Fund expects economic growth in the UAE to pick up this year, rising to 2.5% from 1.6% in 2019.
Dubai, which will host Expo 2020 this year, announced a record budget of around $18 billion for 2020, a 17% increase year on year.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined to 54.9 in January from 56.9 in December. Any reading above the 50 mark indicates expansion.
The headline figure - which gives a measure of operating conditions in the non-oil private economy - was the lowest since December 2018.
""January data suggested that non-oil private sector companies remained in expansion mode. However, business activity was again constrained by a slowdown in new order growth,"" said Tim Moore, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
""The latest rise in sales volumes was the softest recorded for 13 months,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, is aiming to boost the private sector and diversify its revenues, but will likely see its growth curbed this year because of sliding oil prices and crude output cuts agreed with OPEC allies.
Growth in the non-oil private sector averaged 57.1 last year, index data showed, markedly up from a 53.8 average in 2018, when growth was sluggish after Riyadh introduced a 5% VAT to improve non-oil revenue generation after a plunge in oil prices from mid-2014.
But it lost momentum in December, weighed down by slower output and new orders.
In January, new export orders fell below the 50.0 no-change threshold for a second consecutive month, reflecting subdued business conditions in key overseas markets, according to the survey.
Employment slowed down too in January, remaining just slightly above the 50 mark, the slowest rate of job creation since August 2019.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing rebounds; Boeing, coronavirus loom","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity unexpectedly rebounded in January after contracting for five straight months amid a surge in new orders, offering hope that a prolonged slump in business investment has probably bottomed out.
A rebound in business investment is critical to keeping the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track amid signs of fatigue in consumer spending. The improvement in manufacturing reported by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Monday likely reflected an ebb in trade tensions between the United States and China.
But manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy, is not out of the woods. Boeing (N:BA) last month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded last March following two fatal crashes. The coronavirus, which has killed hundreds in China and infected thousands globally, could disrupt supply chains, especially for electronics producers.
""A first step toward de-escalation in the trade war certainly helped,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We are only beginning to understand the potential effects of the coronavirus outbreak and what it means for supply chains.""
The ISM said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July, from an upwardly revised 47.8 in December.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. The ISM index had held below the 50 threshold for five straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 48.5 in January from the previously reported 47.2 in December.
Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal last month. The deal, however, left in place U.S. tariffs on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total, which economists say will remain a constraint on manufacturing.
The ISM said ""global trade remains a cross-industry issue, but many respondents were positive for the first time in several months."" The survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index jumped to a reading of 52.0 last month, the highest since May, from a revised 47.6 in December. 
A measure of exports orders raced to the highest level since September 2018, while a gauge of imports touched levels not seen in 11 months. Manufacturers also reported paying more for raw materials and other inputs. The survey's measure of prices paid hit its highest level in 10 months, suggesting some building up of inflation pressures at the factory level.
The Federal Reserve held interest rates unchanged last week and could keep monetary policy on hold at least through this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that while manufacturing PMIs in many jurisdictions had moved up off of their lows, ""I would just say none of this is assured."" 
The 18-month-long U.S.-China trade war has pressured business confidence and undercut capital expenditure. Business investment contracted in the fourth quarter for the third straight quarter, the longest such stretch since 2009. 
The ISM's factory employment index rose to 46.6 last month from a revised reading of 45.2 in December. It, however, held below the 50 level, suggesting manufacturing payrolls could remain weak. Factory employment increased by 46,000 jobs in 2019 after rising 264,000 in 2018.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher.
MIXED SURVEYS
The rebound in ISM's closely watched national survey follows a series of mixed readings on the manufacturing sector at the regional level. A purchasing manager survey tracking the Chicago region slumped to a four-year low in January. 
A manufacturing index from the Dallas Fed continued to show contraction in the district that covers Texas.
But factory activity in areas monitored by the Philadelphia and Richmond Fed showed significant improvement in January, closely aligning with ISM's findings. A separate survey on Monday from data firm IHS Markit showed its manufacturing sector PMI fell to a reading of 51.9 in January from 52.4 in December. 
""It is hard to tell a consistent story that covers all of the manufacturing surveys,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Economists estimate Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth. The economy grew 2.3% in 2019, the slowest in three years, after expanding 2.9% in 2018.
The coronavirus could hurt global growth, which has been stabilizing after declining since mid-2018. The strengthening in the manufacturing surveys, including the ISM, has left some economists hopeful that the so-called hard manufacturing data like durable goods orders and industrial production would follow suit. They, however, caution that hard manufacturing data could remain soft for a while because of the production cuts at Boeing and supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus.
""The production cuts at Boeing could yet weigh on the hard data at the start of this year,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London. ""The likely hit to manufacturing activity in China from the coronavirus shutdown could also become a headwind for U.S. producers, particularly those reliant on intermediate parts from China.""
While manufacturing appears to be stabilizing, the construction sector is showing some weakness. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending decreased 0.2% in December, the first drop since June, as investment in both private and public projects fell.

Construction spending increased 5.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. For all of 2019, construction spending fell 0.3%, the first annual decline since 2011, after rising 3.3% in 2018.

The officers also said they were seeing weaker demand for business loans from firms and that interest in most commercial real estate loans was unchanged.
For household loans, it was a mixed picture with loan standards unchanged for residential real estate loans but a less rosy picture for credit cards and auto loans.
""Banks reportedly tightened their lending standards on credit card and auto loans, while demand remained unchanged for credit cards and weakened for auto loans,"" the U.S. central bank said in its quarterly survey.
U.S. banks previously reported keeping loan standards mostly unchanged for many business loans while tightening commercial real estate loans in the third quarter.
Last week the U.S. central bank kept interest rates unchanged and continued to signal that it plans to hold them steady for the foreseeable future unless there is a material change in the U.S. economy.
The coronavirus outbreak in China has already rattled world markets and a senior Fed official on Friday called it a ""wildcard"" that could pose risks to U.S. growth if the economic harm to China is sustained over a long period.
Loan officers were also asked about their outlook for this year as part of the latest survey. Their responses showed that they expected to tighten loan standards for most business, credit card and auto loans, and expected demand to hold steady for most types of loans.
They did, however expect some deterioration in loan performance. ""Credit card and auto loans to nonprime borrowers stand out as the loan categories for which the largest net shares of banks expect a deterioration in loan performance over 2020,"" the Fed said.

1324,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 03, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",Britain’s Productivity Decline Is the Worst in 250 Years,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K.’s worst productivity slump in a quarter of a millennium may be caused by a “perfect storm” of three factors, according to a study by economists at the University of Sussex and Loughborough University.
Productivity was almost 20% below its pre-2008 path in 2018 -- the worst slowdown since the reign of George III and a “shockingly bad” performance, said Nicholas Crafts, who co-authored the paper with Terence Mills. It may have been caused by the end of the information and communications technology boom, the financial crisis, and Brexit, they said in research to be published by the National Institute Economic Review on Feb. 6.
Though technology had a substantial impact on productivity around the turn of the 21st century, it contributed less than a quarter of that in the decade since 2008. A new revolution may be on the horizon with artificial intelligence but this has yet to have a significant impact, the economists said. At the same time, Brexit has meant top managers have had to turn their focus to planning, and also led to a relative shrinking of highly productive exporters compared with less efficient domestically orientated firms."

The Commerce Department said on Monday construction spending decreased 0.2%. Data for November was revised up to show construction outlays rising 0.7% instead of increasing 0.6% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.5% in December. Construction spending increased 5.0% on a year-on-year basis in December.
For all of 2019, construction spending fell 0.3%, the first annual decline since 2011, after rising 3.3% in 2018.
In December, spending on private construction projects slipped 0.1% after increasing 0.6% in November. It was pulled down by a 1.8% tumble in spending on nonresidential structures, which includes manufacturing plant and mining exploration, shafts and wells, to the lowest level since November 2018.
Spending on nonresidential structures fell 0.5% in November. The government in its fourth-quarter GDP report last week said spending on nonresidential structures contracted in 2019 by the most since 2016. Outlays on private nonresidential structures have been depressed by a manufacturing downturn due to trade tensions and cheaper energy products.
Spending on homebuilding increased 1.4% after surging 1.5% in November. Residential construction is being supported by lower mortgage rates. Residential investment increased solidly in the second half of 2019, after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the recession.
Investment in public construction projects dropped 0.4% in December after rebounding 1.0% in November. Spending on state and local government construction projects fell 0.6% after rising 0.9% in November. Outlays on federal government construction projects surged 2.1% in December to the highest level since December 2012. That followed a 1.7% advance in November."

Analysts polled by Reuters in late 2019 expected Russia's gross domestic product to expand 1.2%. The central bank predicted that the economy would grow by no more than 1.3%.
The GDP figures are closely watched by the market because the issue of sluggish economic growth in Russia has become acute recently, drawing attention from President Vladimir Putin, who ordered his government to find ways to speed up the economy.
""This is the first estimate as we don't have full data yet,"" said Pavel Malkov, the head of Rosstat statistics service, presenting the 2019 growth figure.
The reading can change in the future when Rosstat obtains more information, Malkov told reporters.
Rosstat has revised data in the past, usually to give the statistics a more positive hue. For example, in late 2019 Rosstat revised GDP growth figures, altering the trajectory of Russia's 2018 economic growth to 2.5% from 2.3%.
Rosstat has said it has five readings of GDP and revisions make numbers more accurate.
In the next few years, GDP growth is expected to pick up thanks to state investment in large infrastructure projects, reaching 2% to 3% by 2022, according to the central bank's forecasts.
This year, the Russian economy was seen growing by 1.8%, below the 2.5% global growth projected by the World Bank, analysts polled in late January predicted."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's manufacturing sector emerged from its longest decline since the financial crisis last month, after a boost from December's election result, though weak European demand and Brexit concerns muted the optimism, a survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to the no-change level of 50.0 from 47.5 in December, slightly stronger than an earlier ""flash"" reading for January of 49.8 which had shown the index just within contraction territory.
""Reduced levels of political uncertainty following the general election led to mild recoveries in new orders and business confidence and a stabilization of production volumes,"" IHS Markit said.
December's reading was the second-lowest since 2012, and the manufacturing PMI had been below 50 since May, the longest such unbroken run since 2009.
Manufacturing makes up 10% of the British economy, and the most recent official data showed the sector shrank by 2.0% in the 12 months to the end of November.
January's rebound matches other data since Prime Minister Boris Johnson won an unexpectedly big parliamentary majority in a Dec. 12 election, reducing short-run uncertainty over Brexit and the government's political direction.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last week that data in early 2020 had been good enough to keep the BoE from cutting interest rates after weakness in late 2019, but the survey numbers would need to be confirmed by official figures.
Past PMI surveys have sometimes overestimated the scale of upturns and downturns in the economy.
New orders grew overall at the fastest rate since April 2019, but export orders continued to decline, which manufacturers blamed on weak economies in mainland Europe.
After leaving the European Union at 2300 GMT on Jan. 31 following 47 years of membership, Johnson now has until the end of the year to negotiate a trade deal that will avoid new tariffs on British goods.
However, the car industry and other sectors which rely on just-in-time delivery worry that future border checks will make their British operations uncompetitive.
""Optimism remained low compared to the historical standards of the survey, in part due to ongoing uncertainty at some firms about the impact of Brexit,"" IHS Markit said.
The BoE said some new trade frictions will be unavoidable, and estimates Britain's sustainable annual growth rate over the coming years will fall to 1.1% from an average of 1.6% since the financial crisis."

Euro-area manufacturing started 2020 showing signs of recovery after unexpected economic contractions in France and Italy damped growth in the fourth quarter.
Order books in the region continued to stabilize in January and warehouse stocks fell the most in more than three years. Expectations for output growth also jumped as sentiment across the region improved.
“Green shoots of recovery” are in sight, said Chris Williamson, an economist at IHS Markit. “The improvement adds to our view that the euro-zone economy could see growth strengthen in the coming months.
The 19-nation economy expanded a mere 0.1% in the fourth quarter, the least in almost seven years.
While France can blame its poor performance at least partially on disruptions caused by massive strikes against President Emmanuel Macron’s pension reform, Italy’s is facing more persistent problems. The IMF has urged the government to liberalize its labor market and improve competition to rekindle chronically low economic growth.
In the euro area, a Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing rose to 47.9 from 46.3, slightly exceeding an initial estimate. While the reading below 50 still indicates contraction, it’s the strongest since April. Gauges for industry in Greece, Ireland and France signaled expansion.
The report is likely to reinforce views that the year-long factory slump that has hobbled the euro-area economy is finally coming to an end. The European Central Bank has turned slightly more optimistic, arguing risks to the economy have become “less pronounced.”
At the same time, many threats remain.
“Key risks which could alter the brightening outlook include the threat of U.S. tariffs and trade-war escalation, Brexit-related disruptions to trade as well as uncertainty surrounding the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus,” according to Williamson.
European companies operating in the city and across China have already started to flag hits to profit from extended plant closures. Wuhan is the fourth-largest city for auto production in the country, and both Peugeot and  Renault  (PA:RENA) have operations there.

Releasing its final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, Markit said the outbreak in China - Germany's largest trading partner - would also hurt business sentiment in Europe's biggest economy.
Still, the survey found that the manufacturing sector contracted at the slowest pace in 11 months in January on slower falls in new orders and export sales.
IHS Markit's PMI for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 45.3 after falling in December.
The figure was higher than a flash reading of 45.2 but remained below the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction for a 13th month in a row.
""The recent improvement in manufacturers' expectations extended into January, with firms noting the influence of easing trade tensions and the prospect of a revival in exports,"" said Phil Smith, economist at IHS Markit.
Despite the improvement in orders and export sales, employment and output remained deep in contraction, highlighting the challenges still facing German manufacturers.
Smith said those challenges are likely to be exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak.
""The picture has change somewhat in the short space of time since the survey was conducted, with the disruption to business in China from the coronavirus bound to have an impact,"" he said.
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said last week it was too early to tell how the coronavirus could impact the German economy.

IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a nine-month high of 47.9 in January, just above a preliminary reading of 47.8 and edging closer to the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. It was 46.3 in December.
An index measuring output that feeds into a Composite PMI, due on Wednesday and seen as a good guide of economic health, climbed to 48.0 from 46.1, its highest reading since June.
""Euro zone manufacturing started 2020 with green shoots of recovery in sight,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The improvement adds to our view that the euro zone economy could see growth strengthen in the coming months, meaning the European Central Bank will hold off with any policy changes and instead focus on its strategic review.""
Last month the central bank left policy unchanged but launched a broad review of its policy that is likely to see new President Christine Lagarde redefine the ECB's main goal of price stability and how to achieve it.
The ECB has struggled for years to get inflation anywhere near its just below 2% target and factories again cut prices last month. The output prices index fell to 48.6 from December's 48.9.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its purchasing managers' index rose to 51.1 in January from 50.4 in December, moving the index further above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
Nevertheless, the broader outlook for the French economy remains uncertain as the impact of strikes against President Emmanuel Macron's plans to simplify and streamline the country's pension system starts to bite.
Data last week showed the French economy had unexpectedly contracted in the final quarter of last year as manufacturing output slumped in the face of the strikes.
""Output grew at a faster pace (in January) compared to December and there was a fresh rise in new orders. That said, there was a disappointment on the job front, as employment slipped into contraction territory,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
""At the sub-sector level, consumer goods firms led the way with another marked improvement in business conditions. Meanwhile, the health of the investment goods sub-sector stabilized after deteriorating in December.

For full-year 2019, the median forecast of 14 analysts was for 5.03%, compared with the previous year's 5.17%.
A smaller pool of analysts predicted growth in Southeast Asia's largest economy would then pick up to 5.09% this year, though some noted that the coronavirus epidemic in China could hurt the global economy, including Indonesia.
Last year, Indonesia's economy was battered by falling exports in line with slowing global trade due to the protracted U.S.-China tariff dispute and sluggish investment, with businesses adopting a wait-and-see approach due to domestic elections. The third quarter's growth rate was the weakest in over two years.
""We expect Indonesia's Q4 GDP growth to have edged up marginally but remain at lackluster levels,"" ANZ in a research note.
The bank pointed to deteriorating capital goods imports, which is a proxy for investment, while net export volume growth had likely eased.
The government has sought to prop up GDP growth by making no significant cuts in its spending, despite a $15 billion revenue shortfall in 2019. The central bank last year also reduced rates by 100 basis points and eased lending rules to lift growth.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani last month predicted economic growth of 5.06% for the October-December quarter. That would bring 2019 growth's to 5.02%, below the government's 5.3% target, she said. This year's target is also 5.3%.
She expected household consumption to have stagnated and public spending to have slowed in the fourth quarter, but investment may have picked up, according to her presentation to lawmakers.
David Sumual, BCA's chief economist, said this year's GDP will be affected by the coronavirus epidemic, with tourism and transport sectors already taking a hit.
However, the virus could also be seen as an opportunity, Sumual said. ""When there were floods in Thailand, automotive companies diversified their investment. Trade war has also triggered factory relocation,"" he said, adding that the epidemic may force companies to diversify even more into Southeast Asia.
There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Indonesia.

The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturers rose to 51.3 in January, exceeding the 50-point line that separates expansion from contraction for the first time since March 2018, the Istanbul Chamber of Industry and IHS Markit panel said.
New orders returned to growth with improving customer demand and new export order also increased, ending a five-month moderation, the panel said.
Manufacturers expanded production for the third consecutive month, as a result of the rise in new orders, it said, adding that some firms using inventories to meet new business led to the sharpest decrease in stocks since July.
Employment rose for the first time in three months, which the panel linked to the need for additional resources. Input prices rose at the fastest pace in six months, which panelists said was due to ongoing currency weakness, while output prices rose at a moderate pace.
""PMI data for January signaled that the Turkish manufacturing sector made a positive start to 2020. Renewed growth of new orders encouraged firms to accelerate the pace of output expansion, resulting in the need for additional staff,"" said Andrew Harker, associate director at IHS Markit.

In response to the jump in sales, factories hired new workers at the fastest rate in more than seven years.
If sustained, the improvement in business conditions could point to a gradual economic recovery in coming months, as forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll last month, after growth slowed to a more than six-year low in the July-September quarter.

A new orders sub-index that tracks overall demand hit its highest level since December 2014 and output grew at its fastest pace in over seven and a half years, pushing manufacturers to hire at the strongest rate since August 2012.
Meanwhile, both input costs and output prices rose at a slower pace, indicating overall inflation may have eased after hitting a more than five year high of 7.35% in December, although probably not below the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's industrial firms posted their first annual decline in profits in four years in 2019, as the slowest economic growth in almost 30 years and a bruising trade war with the United States hit the country's factories.
Official data released on Monday showed industrial profits declining 3.3% on an annual basis to 6.1996 trillion yuan ($897.96 billion) in 2019, compared with the 2.1% dip in the January-November period, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on its website. It was first full-year decline since 2015 when profits fell 2.3%.
The figures, however, predate the significant worsening of the coronavirus outbreak seen in January, which economists expect to seriously hurt economic growth in the first half of 2020.
The virus, which has killed over 300 people in China and infected over 17,000 patients in the past few weeks, could drag China’s economic growth to 5% or lower in the first quarter, analysts say.
China's economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019 amid its trade war with the United States.
Analysts expect Beijing to step up liquidity and credit support for the economy but such measures are unlikely to turn the economy around in the first quarter as the virus may further erode domestic demand.
For the month of December, profits fell 6.3% from a year earlier to 588.39 billion yuan ($85.22 billion), erasing the gain seen in November, the data showed.
The contraction in last year's profits came mainly from slowing sales and increasing raw material and labor costs, said Zhu Hong, an official with the statistics bureau in a statement released alongside the data.
Profits in key industries like steel, petrochemicals and automobiles fell markedly, said Zhu.
For the whole of 2019, profits at state-owned industrial firms dropped 12.0%, while private-sector profits rose 2.2%.
Liabilities at industrial firms grew 5.4% year on year at end-2019, versus a 5.3% increase as of end-November."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's housing market started the year with a bang as annual price growth accelerated to the fastest pace since late 2017, supporting consumer wealth and confidence in the face of damaging wildfires and the coronavirus scare.
Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Monday showed home prices across the nation rose 0.9% in January, from December when they were up 1.1%.
That brought the gains for the 12 months to January to 4.1%, a world away from the punishing declines seen early last year.
The revival was led by the major cities with values in Sydney up by 1.1% in January and 7.9% for the year. Melbourne boasted gains of 1.2% and 8.2% respectively.
The bull market was also becoming more broad-based with every major city recording gains in January, while values in Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra hit all-time highs.
January is seasonally a slow period for home sales being the peak of the Australian summer holiday season. This year sentiment was also darkened by bushfires raging across the southeast of the continent.
The spread of the coronavirus has added a new headwind by badly hindering Chinese tourism to Australia.
As a result, analysts have trimmed forecasts for economic growth this quarter and markets have stepped up wagers of more interest rate cuts.

An easing is now fully priced in by May, having been brought in from July given the latest news on the virus. Investors have even priced in a two-in-three risk of a further move to 0.25% by yearn end.
Rates were cut three times last year in an attempt to stimulate consumer spending, with only limited success.
Still, the rebound in home prices is a boon for wealth with Australia's housing stock valued at a hefty A$6.9 trillion ($4.72 trillion).
""The lift in home prices has the potential to boost perceived wealth and thus boost consumer spending,"" said Ryan Felsman, a senior economist at CommSec.
""Wealth is at record highs and incomes are still running faster than consumer prices. The missing ingredient is confidence.""
The surge in prices is also attracting more money into home building after more than a year of sharp declines.
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Monday showed approvals to build new homes held steady in December, a surprisingly firm result after a steep jump the month before.
Maree Kilroy, an economist for BIS Oxford Economics, noted annual growth in approvals had turned positive for the first time in 18 months.
""The positive momentum that has developed in the established property market and the flow through of a range of stimulus measures to new dwelling demand sets the scene for a recovery in approvals over 2020,"" she added.
The residential construction sector is a major employer and spills over into wider activity as homes are furnished."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's current account surplus remained the world's largest last year despite trade tensions, the Ifo economic institute will say on Monday, in an estimate likely to renew criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's fiscal policies.
The Ifo estimate, seen by Reuters ahead of publication, put Germany's current account surplus -- which measures the flow of goods, services and investments -- at some $293 billion in 2019.
It is the fourth successive year that Germany's current account surplus has been the world's largest, with Japan's the next largest at $194 billion, according to Ifo calculations.
The International Monetary Fund and the European Commission have for years urged Germany, Europe's largest economy, to do more to lift domestic demand and imports as a way to reduce global economic imbalances and stimulate growth elsewhere.
Since his election, U.S. President Donald Trump has also criticized Germany's export strength.
Germany's current account surplus can mainly be attributed to the fact that far more German products and services are sold overseas than imported to Europe's largest economy.
Merkel said last year: ""We are proud of our cars and so we should be."" But she added that many were built in the United States and exported to China.
Ifo economist Christian Grimme said the German surplus increased last year by almost 16 billion euros to some 7.6% of gross domestic product (GDP).
""Stronger exports to the U.S. due to the stronger depreciation of the euro and increased exports to the UK, where demand recovered somewhat, saw total German exports rise sharply again in the second half of the year,"" he said.
""By contrast, imports expanded very weakly in the summer half of 2019 - the ongoing industrial recession in Germany severely curbed imports of intermediate goods.""
The European Commission, the EU's executive, considers a current account surplus of 6% as sustainable over the long-term when measured by the size of a country's economy.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at its slowest pace in five months in January, even as an outbreak of a new virus added to risks facing the world's second-largest economy, a private survey showed on Monday.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 51.1 from 51.5 in December, missing expectations but remaining above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for the sixth straight month. Analysts had expected a reading of 51.3.
The findings, which focus mostly on small and export-oriented businesses, were slightly more optimistic than those in an official survey released on Friday, which showed growth had stalled.
But they likely did not reflect the early impact of the public health crisis which flared in late January, which could weigh heavily on economic growth in coming months.
More than 300 people have died from the flu-like virus in China so far and over 14,000 have been infected, with more cases being reported around the world.
The outbreak has prompted widespread transport curbs and tough public health measures in the past week that are already hitting the travel, tourism and retail sectors.
Millions of migrant workers who had returned home for the long Lunar New Year holidays last week may be unable to return to factory floors, and companies in a number of areas including some major manufacturing hubs have been told to stay closed for another week or more.
""In the near term, China's economy will also be impacted by the new pneumonia epidemic,"" and will need more government support, Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in comments on the survey.
Limited improvement in domestic and foreign demand meant some manufacturers did not replenish stocks, said Zhong.
New export orders slipped back into contraction after three months of expansion, while production and total new orders slowed but remained in expansionary territory.
Factories also shed jobs in January for the first time since October.
But business confidence rose to a 22-month high, boosted by a trade deal signed in January between the United States and China, Zhong said. Fears of an epidemic only began to surface late in the month.
Economic growth in China slowed markedly to 6.1% last year, the weakest pace in nearly three decades, amid a bruising trade war with the U.S and despite Beijing's stimulus to boost sluggish investment and demand.
During the SARS outbreak in 2002-03, China's economic growth fell 2 percentage points in a few months, but it rebounded quickly once the disease was brought under control. However, both Chinese demand and the global economy had generally been in better shape."
1344,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 09:06PM ET</span>","South Korea January exports fall for 14th straight month, virus threat looms","By Joori Roh and Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports suffered a sharper contraction in January, falling for a 14th straight month as worsening sentiment over the new coronavirus and the effect from fewer working days outweighed improving global demand for semiconductors.
Overseas sales tumbled 6.1% at the first month of 2020 from a year earlier, trade ministry data showed on Saturday, worse than a 5.2% drop in December but beating a median 7.8% decline tipped in a Reuters poll.
Average exports per working day, however, rose 4.8% on year, the first expansion in 14 months, when eliminating the calendar effect. There were only 21.5 working days in January, 2.5 days less than last year, due to changes in the Lunar New Year holiday.
South Korea's exports are a closely watched bellwether for world trade as it is the first major exporting economy to release monthly foreign trade data.
Overseas sales of semiconductors, the country's top export, accounting for one-fifth of its total exports, fell 3.4% year-on-year, logging the smallest decline in 14 months.
The novel coronavirus' spread across China and the globe had cast a shadow over expectations Asia’s fourth largest economy was heading for a firmer footing. Disruptions from the virus are seen knocking economic growth in China and beyond, denting demand for Korean goods.
The trade ministry said January figures showed barely any impact from the virus, but shipments may be affected from February if risks from the virus threat lingers.
On Monday, the Chinese government has extended the week-long Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 2 as it seeks to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The holiday, which began on Jan. 24, had been due to end on Jan. 30.
""Though we see exports recovery momentum on improving export prices and chip sales, exports to China are likely to have a negative impact, depending on the extent of the virus spread and whether it lasts,"" said Chun Kyu-yeon, an economist at Hana Financial Investment.
Exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, fell 10.5% year-on-year just a month after recording the first growth in 14 months in December.
The ministry said China-bound sales fell mainly due to the holiday comparisons, and that exports to China's Hubei province, where the epidemic originated, accounts for only 0.3% of total exports, meaning the direct impact will be limited.
Imports fell 5.3% in January, better than a 6.9% contraction tipped in the survey and compared to a 4.6% fall in December. That brought the month's trade balance to a $0.62 billion surplus, the smallest in seven years and compared to a $2.02 billion surplus a month earlier.
The trade figures came a day after data showed South Korea's factory output surged sharply and exceeded forecasts in December, as soaring chip production fueled industrial activity."

Revenues increased by 3.1% in November on higher income tax revenues. Program expenses jumped 5.2% because of increases in major transfers to people and other levels of government.
For the first eight months of the 2019-2020 fiscal year, Canada posted a deficit of C$11.75 billion, compared to a deficit of C$2.13 in the same period of 2018-2019.
Revenues between April and November grew by 2.7% on an increase in personal tax revenues, while program expenses were up 7.5% because of a combination of higher major transfers to persons, other levels of government and direct program expenses.

The decision by the six board members present - economist Arturo Galindo will join the usually seven-member board in February - met the predictions of all analysts in a Reuters survey last week.
Those analysts were divided over expectations for the board to hold the rate - which has been in place since April 2018 - throughout 2020 or raise it by between 25 and 75 basis points in the coming months.
In a statement the bank said annual inflation fell slightly to 3.8%, which is significantly higher than the targeted 3%.
However, it added that inflation is expected to fall during the course of the year.
""We continue to hold that by the middle of 2020, inflation will reach around 3.5%,"" bank chief Juan Jose Echavarria told journalists. ""At the end of 2020 it will be nearer 3%.""
In last week's poll, analysts said they expected inflation of 3.36% for 2020, before falling to 3.19% next year.
The bank said it expects Colombia's current account deficit to be above 4% of gross domestic product in 2019 and maintained its outlook for economic growth last year and in 2020 at 3.2% and 3.3% respectively.
""In this sense, the bank is a bit more pessimistic compared to other groups, we are in the low range,"" Echavarria said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters - U.S. consumer spending rose steadily in December, but tepid income gains pointed to moderate consumption growth this year, which together with slumping business investment likely set the economy on a slower growth path this year.
While the report on Friday from the Commerce Department also showed inflation picking up last month because of higher prices for energy products, price pressures remained muted. The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and could keep monetary policy on hold at least through 2020.
Economic growth is already expected to slow considerably in the first quarter, in part because of Boeing's (N:BA) suspension this month of production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which was grounded last March following two fatal crashes. 
""The consumer says don't count on me in 2020, and their support will be critical for growth this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.3% last month as households spent more on prescription medication and healthcare services. That followed an unrevised 0.4% rise in November. 
December's increase in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations. When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending nudged up 0.1% in December after rising 0.3% in the prior month. That likely puts consumer spending on a slower growth trajectory heading into the first quarter. 
For all of 2019, consumer spending increased 4.0%, the smallest gain in three years, after advancing 5.2% in 2018.
The data was included in the gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter, which was published on Thursday. The government reported that growth in consumer spending slowed to a 1.8% annualized rate last quarter after expanding at a brisk 3.2% pace in the July-September period. 
The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the final three months of 2019, matching the third quarter's pace.
Despite the anticipated slowdown in growth this year, a recession is not expected as the economy draws support from the Fed's three rate cuts last year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday that he expected ""moderate economic growth to continue"" but also acknowledged some risks, including the recent coronavirus outbreak in China.
Business investment contracted in the fourth quarter for the third straight quarter, the longest such stretch since 2009. It has been hurt by the Trump administration's 18-month trade war with China, which has depressed business confidence. 
Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal this month, but U.S. tariffs remained in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total. There are no signs of a turnaround in business investment.
A separate report on Friday showed a measure of manufacturing activity in the Midwest dropped to a four-year low in January, with factories reporting declines in new orders and order backlogs.
The dollar (DXY) weakened against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries rose. Stocks on Wall Street fell on worries over the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on global economic growth.
CONSUMER SENTIMENT SEEN EBBING
The World Health Organization declared the epidemic a global emergency on Thursday. The fast-spreading virus has killed more than 200 people in China and infected thousands globally. 
Economists expect the epidemic to weigh on manufacturing by disrupting supply chains. The virus, together with the downturn in manufacturing, slowing job growth and falling share prices, is expected to restrain consumer sentiment this year. Consumer sentiment ticked up in January, other data showed on Friday. 
""Most fundamentals are weakening or expected to do so, so confidence may be near its peak,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Confidence is likely to trend lower in 2020.""
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3% last month, the biggest gain since April. The PCE price index was boosted a 1.5% surge in energy goods and services costs. Food prices were unchanged. 
The PCE price index edged up 0.1% in November. In the 12 months through December, the PCE price index increased 1.6%, the biggest advance in a year, after climbing 1.4% in the 12 months through November.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index gained 0.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in each of the four prior four months. That lifted the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.6% in December from 1.5% in November.
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It missed the U.S. central bank's 2% target every month in 2019.
Benign inflation was underscored by a fourth report from the Labor Department showing the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after a similar gain in the third quarter. 
That lowered the year-on-year rate of gain in the ECI to 2.7%. Labor costs rose 2.8% on a year-on-year basis in the third quarter. The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack. It is also considered a better predictor of core inflation.
Labor costs peaked in the final quarter of 2018 as a tightening labor market pushed up wage growth. The pace of increases has since slowed in tandem with wages.
Personal income gained 0.2% last month after an increase of 0.4% in November. There was a $36.2 billion decrease in farm proprietors' income, reflecting a drop in subsidy payments to farmers caught in the 18-month U.S.-China trade war. 
Income rose 4.5% in 2019 after surging 5.6% in 2018. Wages gained 0.3% in December after rising 0.4% in November.
""Income is just not growing fast enough to support even the modest-to-moderate spending increases,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

Savings fell to $1.28 trillion last month from $1.30 trillion in November. In 2019, savings increased to a record $1.31 trillion from $1.21 trillion in 2018.

1348,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 09:17AM ET</span>","U.S. Consumer Spending Cooled Last Month, Core Prices Picked Up","(Bloomberg) -- Consumer outlays for goods and services, which account for about 70% of gross domestic product, increased 0.3% from the prior month after an unrevised 0.4% advance in November, Commerce Department data showed Friday. The report also showed income growth slowed to 0.2%, reflecting a decrease in farm subsidies, while the Fed’s favored core price gauge exceeded estimates with a 0.2% rise, the most since July.
The data add to other signs that consumers may be poised to offer the record-long expansion less of a boost than before. The figures provide additional detail after a report Thursday showed fourth-quarter GDP growth matched the prior three months but consumption slowed for a second straight period.
Consumers last year aided the world’s largest economy as it was whipsawed by trade policy, a manufacturing slump and faltering business investment. While tensions with China have cooled somewhat, headwinds from factories and investment remain.
After adjusting for inflation, spending climbed 0.1%. That gain was driven by prescription drugs and health care, suggesting that discretionary outlays may be less robust than the headline figures indicate.
Pay Gains
A solid labor market continues to support spending, though pay gains show signs of deceleration despite high labor demand. The Commerce Department’s report showed wages and salaries posted a 0.3% monthly gain that was the weakest since September.
The inflation figures show price pressures are still short of the Fed's goal, even after the central bank cut interest rates three times last year. Powell on Wednesday expressed confidence that inflation would approach 2% in coming months as “unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation.”
The broader personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Fed officially targets for 2% inflation, rose 0.3% from the prior month, topping the median estimate in Bloomberg's survey, and was up 1.6% from a year earlier.
The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, increased 1.6% in December from a year earlier, up from a six-month low of 1.5% in November. Policy makers view the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying price trends and have said they’re also aiming for it to rise 2%.
Higher Inflation
While Thursday's GDP report showed core prices rose at a 1.3% annualized pace in the fourth quarter, Friday's monthly data show that inflation was moving higher at the end of the period.
The data follow the latest statement from Fed policy makers, who on Wednesday kept their main interest rate unchanged while stressing the importance of lifting inflation to their target.
In a separate report Friday from the Labor Department, the employment cost index, a broad gauge monitored by the Fed, rose 0.7% in the fourth quarter from the prior period, as projected. The measure decelerated to a 2.7% annual gain, consistent with other data showing slower gains for workers in late 2019.
Wages and salaries for private workers rose 3% for a fourth straight quarter -- indicating they likely have plateaued despite unemployment at a half-century low -- and the 0.7% rise from the prior quarter was down from 0.9%.
By sector, wage and salary gains cooled in construction, financial activities and professional and business services. The government’s quarterly ECI reading covers employer-paid taxes such as Social Security and Medicare along with other benefits."

ROME/PARIS (Reuters) - The economies of France and Italy, respectively the euro zone's second and third largest, shrank unexpectedly in the last quarter of 2019 causing GDP growth for the 19 countries sharing the single currency to miss forecasts, data showed.
French manufacturing output slumped in the face of strikes over an unpopular pension reform, putting more pressure on President Emmanuel Macron, while in Italy Friday's data hit the outlook for 2020, dealing a blow to its 5-month old government.
The French economy shrank 0.1% in the quarter from the quarter before, when it grew 0.3%, data from INSEE showed, while Italy's gross domestic product fell 0.3% between October and December, following an unrevised 0.1% rise in the third quarter, national statistics bureau ISTAT said in a preliminary estimate.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire blamed the pension protests, which began in December, for the slowdown which he said would be temporary, adding that the fundamentals for French economic growth were ""solid"".
Analysts at British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) backed Le Maire's view. ""We think this is likely to be a one-off, and thus remain confident in our cautiously optimistic outlook,"" they wrote.
But AvaTrade chief market analyst Naeem Aslam said the French figures cast doubt over the European Central Bank's views on the euro zone economy.
In another worrying sign for the ECB, the euro zone as a whole grew less than expected in the last quarter of 2019, a first estimate showed, while core inflation slowed in January.
Gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.1% quarter-on-quarter for a 1.0% year-on-year gain, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.2% quarterly and a 1.1% annual increase.
'EVEN MORE CHALLENGING'
For Italy, the 0.3% GDP drop was the steepest decline since the first quarter of 2013 and was much weaker than expected. None of the 27 economists polled by Reuters had expected a quarterly contraction.
On a year-on-year basis, GDP was flat in the fourth quarter, following an upwardly revised 0.5% rise in the third.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) economist Loredana Federico said the negative carryover effect will make it ""even more challenging"" for Italy to get close to the government's forecast of 0.6% growth this year. Her own forecast is for expansion of just 0.2%.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast Italian growth of 0.5% for 2020 and said its economy would be the weakest in the European Union over the next few years. [L8N29Y2Z4]
Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said heavy rains in November had probably subdued activity in the fourth quarter, and he expected a rebound at the start of this year, adding that ""measures adopted by the government will support growth"".
The government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the left-wing Democratic Party cut income tax by some 3 billion euros in its 2020 budget approved by parliament in December.
Renato Brunetta, economics spokesman of Silvio Berlusconi's opposition Forza Italia party, said the ""disastrous"" data showed the government ""isn't capable of managing the economy.""
ISTAT said the slump was due to a fall in domestic demand which was only partially offset by a positive contribution from trade flows.
It gave no numerical breakdown of components with its preliminary estimate, but said industry and agriculture had contracted, while services had been broadly stagnant.
Over the whole of 2019, growth came in at a preliminary 0.2%, slightly beating the government's most recent forecast of 0.1%. That followed a 0.8% rate in 2018 and was the weakest since 2014.
Upward revisions to year-on-year growth in the second and third quarters propped up the full-year growth rate."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's jobless rate fell to 11.0% in the three months through December, statistics agency IBGE said on Friday, the lowest in almost four years and further evidence that the labor market continues to steadily improve, albeit gradually.
This was down from 11.2% in the three months to November, exactly line with the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and will likely be welcomed by policymakers as another indication the economy is moving in the right direction.
The number of Brazilians out of work in the three months to December was 11.6 million, down 883,000 people or 7.1% from the preceding quarter, IBGE said. Compared with the same period in 2018, the number of people out of work fell by 520,000, or 4.3%.
The underemployment rate, which hit a record 25% earlier this year, fell 1.1 percentage points to 23.0% from the preceding quarter, and was 0.8 percentage points down from the same period the year before, IBGE said.
It was a similar picture with the number of underemployed workers in Brazil: 26.2 million people, down 1.3 million people or 4.7% from the prior three months, IBGE said, and down 670,000 people from the same period the year before."

The surprise slump in two of the region’s biggest nations is yet another blow for their governments. President Emmanuel Macron is already under fire amid protests over controversial pension reforms, while Italy’s fragile coalition is scarred by internal skirmishes.
Output in the 19-nation region rose just 0.1% in the fourth quarter, down from 0.3% in the previous period, and underlying inflation slowed in January to the weakest in three months. The French economy shrank 0.1%, and Italy posted a 0.3% contraction. Germany has previously said it posted slight growth at the end of 2019 -- the official reading is due next month.
The economic gloom may prove to be temporary. Surveys have suggested that the rot has been stemmed for now. The European Central Bank says the risks to the outlook have become “less pronounced,” and more signs of improving momentum came Thursday when the European Commission reported a marked rise in sentiment in January, led by manufacturing and construction.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Growth momentum is set to build into 2020 reflecting fewer risks from the global economy -- trade tension between the U.S. and China have eased somewhat and the worst type of Brexit should be avoided. We see quarterly growth of 0.3% through 2020.”
-- Jamie Rush. 
Still, the reports could revive calls for more spending by countries that have fiscal space, such as Germany. The ECB has repeatedly called for action, and the European Union’s executive arm is planning to publish a document next week asserting that the euro zone’s fiscal rules are too convoluted.
The yield on German 10-Year debt has slipped in recent days and fell below -0.4% for the first time in three months. The euro was little changed at $1.1031 at 11:57 a.m. Frankfurt time on Friday.
Trade risks have returned to the fore with the U.S. renewing threats last week to raise duties on imports of cars from the EU, and France only narrowly avoiding American tariffs on wine and cheese in a dispute over digital taxation. The U.S. just reported the biggest drop in imports since 2009, and new concerns are emerging such as the coronavirus and the hit to Chinese and global growth.
French cognac maker Remy Cointreau has already sounded a note of caution over the impact of the virus on its business in China and ditched its guidance for the year. Airlines including Germany’s Lufthansa cut flights, and Finnish elevator-maker Kone expect a hit on bottom lines amid factory closures.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire blamed his economy’s poor results on disruptions in ports, the rail network and fuel deposits and highlighted resilient consumption and business investment.
“This temporary slowdown does not call into question the fundamentals of French growth,” he said. Without the curb from companies using up stocks rather than increasing production, the economy would have expanded about 0.3%.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew less than expected in the last quarter of 2019, a first estimate showed on Friday, while core inflation slowed in January, a worrying sign for the European Central Bank.
Gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.1% quarter-on-quarter for a 1.0% year-on-year gain, according to Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.2% quarterly and a 1.1% annual increase.
""The ECB will not like today's data. This is because it is counting on stronger economic growth to drive inflation up. In fact, the economy actually lost momentum in autumn,"" said Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
The disappointing growth for the euro zone was mainly caused by GDP contractions in France and Italy, its second and third biggest economies.
The ECB targets inflation below but close to 2% over the medium term, but it has been struggling to hit that target for years, despite its program of government purchases to inject more cash into the economy.
Eurostat said consumer prices fell 1.0% month-on-month in January for a 1.4% year-on-year rise, accelerating from a 1.3% rate in December and 1.0% in November.
But the pick-up in headline price growth was mainly caused by a jump in the volatile prices of food, alcohol and tobacco, which rose 2.2% year-on-year. Energy prices were also up 1.8%.
Without unprocessed food and energy -- what the ECB calls core inflation -- prices grew 1.3% year-on-year, decelerating from 1.4% in December.
An even narrower inflation measure watched by many market economists also excludes alcohol and tobacco, which can move if excise taxes change. It decelerated even more, to 1.1% from 1.3% in December, year-on-year.
""Headline inflation ticked up, but core inflation fell to 1.1%,"" said Bert Colijn, senior euro zone economist at ING bank. ""Core was always likely to come back down again as it had trended higher than price pressures warranted at 1.3% over the past two months."""

The number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 67,241 in December - higher than the consensus forecast of 65,700 in a Reuters poll of economists - from 65,514 in November.
The value of mortgage lending rose by 4.55 billion pounds, also stronger than the poll forecast of 4.1 billion pounds.
There have been other signs that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's victory in the Dec. 12 election - which removed the possibility of a further delay to Brexit which is due to happen on Friday - has given a confidence boost to the economy.
On Thursday, the BoE kept rates on hold after the signals of a pick-up. Many investors had expected a rate cut.
Growth in consumer credit rose by 1.2 billion pounds, stronger than the poll forecast too.
The BoE figures showed credit card borrowing rose by the most since February, up by 412 million pounds.
Household spending has helped to drive Britain's economy over the last few years, helped by record levels of employment and a recovery in wage growth. But there were signs of a slowdown in spending in late 2019.

1354,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 31, 2020 04:23AM ET</span>","French, Italian Economies Shrink in Blow to Europe’s Recovery","(Bloomberg) -- The French and Italian economies unexpectedly shrank at the end of 2019, casting a shadow over expectations the euro area was on a firmer footing.
France’s strike-ridden economy contracted 0.1% amid a decline in exports and a huge drag from companies using up stocks rather than increasing production. Italy’s GDP fell 0.3%, the most in almost seven years.
Neighboring Spain fared significantly better at the end of last year, reinforcing its position as one of Europe’s outperformers. Faster-than-anticipated growth of 0.5% was driven by buoyant exports and a strong increase in services.
France’s unexpected contraction is a sting for Macron, who’s already facing mass protests and strikes against his pension reforms, and which have disrupted household spending. His government has repeatedly pointed to France’s relative strength in Europe as a sign his reforms of taxes and labor laws are working.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire blamed the poor results on disruptions in ports, the rail network and fuel deposits and highlighted resilient consumption and business investment.
“This temporary slowdown does not call into question the fundamentals of French growth, which are solid,” he told reporters in a statement. “We are nonetheless particularly vigilant of international uncertainties.”
Consumer spending contracted 0.3% in December, when the impact of the strikes was the most acute. Households cut back on expenditures for clothes, home furnishings and food, statistics from Insee showed.
On a quarterly basis, household consumption and business investment recorded their weakest performance of the year.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“Our central scenario is for growth to rebound to 0.3% in 1Q before increasing to 0.4% from the following quarter. But the risks are tilted to the downside.”
-- Maeva Cousin. 
France’s slump takes away from the more upbeat mood emerging about Europe recently. Surveys have suggested that the rot has been stemmed for now, and growth in the region could improve in 2020.
The European Central Bank has already been striking a more positive tone, highlighting that risks to the outlook have become “less pronounced.” More signs of improving momentum came Thursday when the European Commission reported a marked rise in sentiment in January, led by manufacturing and construction.
There’s still plenty that could test the European economy’s resilience.
Trade risks have returned to the fore with the U.S. renewing threats last week to raise duties on imports of cars from the EU, and France only narrowly avoiding American tariffs on wine and cheese in a dispute over digital taxation. New risks are also emerging, notably including how much the spread of the deadly coronavirus drags on the Chinese and global economies.
French cognac maker   Remy Cointreau   (PA:RCOP) has already sounded a note of caution over the impact of the virus on its business in China. The company ditched its guidance for the year.
At home, French companies are also facing headwinds from prolonged transport strikes. Retailer Casino Guichard Perrachon SA pointed to the disruption as a reason for cutting its profit forecast earlier in January, and the tourism sector is also expected to suffer.
GDP figures for the whole of the euro area will be published later Friday. Economists expect growth to have slowed to 0.2% in the fourth quarter.
In the U.S., the economy grew at a 2.1% annualized pace in the fourth quarter, matching the previous period, though consumer spending growth weakened and business investment declined.
Figures from Spain -- also due Friday -- are expected to show growth steady at 0.4% in the fourth quarter. There’s been encouraging numbers from some of the euro area’s smaller economies already. Belgium’s economy grew 0.4% in the period, while expansion in Austria accelerated to 0.3% from 0.1%."

Retail sales fell by 3.3% on the month in real terms after a downwardly revised rise of 1.6% in the previous month, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed. This beat a Reuters forecast of analysts for a 0.5% drop.
Retail sales are a volatile indicator often subject to revision.
German consumer morale unexpectedly rose in January, the GfK market research group said on Wednesday, suggesting that a partial agreement reached in the U.S.-Sino trade conflict is putting German buyers at ease.

The surprisingly sharp slowdown is a blow for President Emmanuel Macron who has so far been able to point to resilient growth and job creation to justify his pro-business reform agenda.
The INSEE statistics agency said the euro zone's second-biggest economy shrank 0.1% in the period from the previous three months, when it grew 0.3%.
The weak year-end performance confounded economists' expectations who on average had forecast growth of 0.2% in the quarter. None of the 33 economists polled by Reuters had expected anything weaker than 0.1% growth.
INSEE said that consumer spending growth had slowed to 0.2% in the quarter from 0.4% in the previous three months, despite a raft of measures last year to boost households' purchasing power. Meanwhile, business investment growth slowed to only 0.3% from 1.6% in the third quarter.
Overall, domestic demand contributed 0.3 percentage points to growth in the quarter, but that was erased by the -0.4 percentage point impact of companies drawing down inventories rather than producing new goods. The contribution of foreign trade was flat.
The economy's year-end performance means that over course of 2019 it grew 1.2%, which was nevertheless in line with the government's forecast despite the unexpectedly weak year end."

The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index dropped to 50 in January, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Friday, matching the median estimate of economists. The non-manufacturing gauge was 54.1, compared with 53.5 the previous month.
Due to the holiday, the surveys were conducted earlier in January than normal, before the extent of the disease outbreak and the disruption to the economy were evident.
China’s economy was already slowing amid weak domestic demand, a crackdown on debt and the trade war with the U.S. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which has killed hundreds and sickened thousands, is now hammering growth as businesses shut for at least another week and people across major cities avoid going out for fear of getting sick.
“We expect a big plunge of both manufacturing and service PMIs in February and March,” said Lu Ting, chief china economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong. “The virus outbreak may further weaken domestic demand and thus render the upcoming policy easing less effective.”
The worsening health crisis has seen numerous economists revise down their forecasts for growth. Many expect the government and central bank will step in to cushion the blow.
What Bloomberg’s economists say...
The positive signal from China’s non-manufacturing PMI in January clearly doesn’t reflect the reality now - the economy will take a hit in the near term from the outbreak, and policy is likely to shift to intensive cyclical support for growth.

The impact of the new coronavirus “has not been fully reflected in January PMI, and its influence on the economy shouldn’t be underestimated,” Zhang Liqun, an analyst at China Logistics Information Center compiling the data with the NBS, wrote in a statement. “Efforts are needed to stabilize growth.”
GDP growth will slow to 4% year-on-year in the first quarter from a previously forecast 5.6%, according to Andrew Tilton, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in Hong Kong. Even with the assumption of a relatively quick rebound in the second and third quarters, that would lower full-year 2020 growth to 5.5%, he said.
“A more prolonged outbreak could lower full-year growth to 5% or even below,” Tilton wrote in a note to clients dated Jan. 31."
1358,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 11:22PM ET</span>",China's December soybean imports from U.S. soar amid easing trade tensions,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports of U.S. soybeans surged in December from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, as China ramped up purchases during a thaw in the two country's trade war.
China brought in 3.09 million tonnes of soybeans from the United States in December, 44 times the level a year ago, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. 
The figure was also up from 2.56 million tonnes in November, after some delayed cargoes cleared customs, but was still shy of the six million-plus levels for U.S. December imports to China in 2017 and earlier years.
Friday's data provided a breakdown of China's buying by origin after figures released earlier in January showed it bought 88.51 million tonnes of soybeans overall in 2019, just up from 88.03 million tonnes in 2018. 
(GRAPHIC: China annual soybean imports by main supplier - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8347/8328/ChinaAnnualSoyImportsThru2019.png)
Beijing has pledged to buy billions of dollars more in agricultural goods from the United States as part of a Phase 1 deal to calm a bitter trade row. Soybeans made up more than half of its U.S. agricultural purchases in 2017 before the trade war erupted and are expected to make up a key part of any increased purchases.
For all of 2019, China brought in 16.94 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans, edging up from 16.6 million tonnes in 2018, when shipments nearly halved from the previous year due to the trade dispute.
China usually turns to U.S. soybeans in the fourth quarter of the year when the American harvest dominates the market. But U.S. cargoes nearly halted in late 2018 after Beijing slapped retaliatory tariffs on a list of U.S. products including soybeans.
(GRAPHIC: China seasonal soybean imports from the U.S. vs rest of world - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8348/8329/ChinaSeasonalSoyImportsthru2019.png)
Chinese buyers, however, resumed some purchases of U.S. beans after a truce in their trade row and after Beijing issued extra tariff-free waivers for some American shipments in a goodwill gesture to Washington. 
China's December shipments from Brazil, its largest supplier of the oilseed, came in at 4.83 million tonnes, up 10% from a year earlier, and up 25.1% from November. 
For the full year, China brought in 57.67 million tonnes of soybeans from Brazil, down 12.8% from 66.1 million tonnes in 2018. 
Chinese importers bring in soybeans to crush into cooking oil, and soymeal to feed the livestock sector. 
Overall imports in 2019 were down from 95.54 million tonnes in 2017, with China's demand curbed by the deadly African swine fever disease, which has nearly halved the country's massive pig herd.

The 2017 imports included 32.85 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans and 50.93 million tonnes from Brazil.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 09:53PM ET</span>",China's factory activity stalls as virus risks grow,"By Gabriel CROSSLEY and Lusha Zhang
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's factory activity faltered in January, an official survey showed, as export orders fell and an outbreak of a new virus added to risks facing the world's second-largest economy.
The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.0 in January from 50.2 in December, China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Friday. The reading was in line with analysts' forecasts and hit the neutral 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
While the PMI showed activity in some parts of the sector holding up, economists are doubtful the survey provides a meaningful read on the economy given recent developments with the coronavirus and distortions from the Lunar New Year break.
More than 200 people have died from the virus in China in the past few weeks, prompting widespread transport curbs and tough public health measures that are weighing heavily on the travel, tourism and retail sectors. Analysts say the fast-spreading virus could hurt first-quarter economic growth.
""I would disregard today's release,"" said Raymond Yeung, Chief Economist for Greater China at ANZ, in an email to Reuters. 
""The figure certainly overrates the economic outlook as it does not reflect the interruption due to the outbreak,"" he said. 
China's economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019 amid a bruising trade war with the United States.
The PMI's component indicators painted a mixed picture of the sector.
New export orders slipped back into contraction after rising for the first time in over a year in December while production slowed from a multi-month high but remained in expansionary territory. Total new orders expanded at a slightly faster clip than the month before. 
The sub-index for imports fell deeper into contraction.
Factories also continued to shed jobs in January, although the pace of reduction slowed.
China watchers typically advise caution in their analysis of economic data early in the year due to the effect of the week-long Lunar New Year holidays, which usually slows activity.
Many firms scale back operations or close for long periods around the holidays, which began on Jan. 24 this year. This year, China's government extended the Lunar New Year holidays to limit the spread of the virus.
""Extended closures could ripple through supply chains across China and beyond,"" Capital Economics said in a note to clients this week.
In contrast, activity in China's service sector quickened with the official non-manufacturing PMI rising to 54.1 from 53.5 in December.
However, the NBS warned the impact of the coronavirus is not fully reflected in the survey and that more observation was needed.
Already, the outbreak has been seen hitting service sectors such as transportation, tourism, catering and entertainment as people avoid crowded areas. 
Analysts estimated its impact on China's economy could be bigger than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.
Beijing has relied more on services and consumption to offset manufacturing weakness now than then.
One bright spot might be construction, Capital Economics said in a note, with the sub-index for the industry rising to 59.7 in January from 56.7, a sign local governments have been quick to begin new infrastructure projects this year. 
Economic growth in China slowed to 6.1% last year, the weakest pace in nearly three decades, amid a bruising trade war with the United States and despite Beijing's stimulus to boost sluggish investment and demand.
""We expect a big plunge of both manufacturing and service PMIs in February and March due to the coronavirus outbreak,"" Ting Lu, Chief China Economist at Nomura, said. 
Beijing will try to provide liquidity and credit support to the economy, especially to businesses severely hit by the outbreak, he said.

""However, it seems unlikely that these measures would turn the economy around in Q1 and part of Q2, as the virus outbreak may further weaken domestic demand and thus render the upcoming policy easing less effective.​​​​​""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's December factory output exceeded forecasts as soaring chip production fueled industrial activity, but the virus outbreak in China will likely dent demand in January.
Industrial output jumped by a seasonally adjusted 3.5% in December from a month earlier, government data showed on Friday, easily beating a 0.5% rise tipped in a Reuters survey and marking the fastest jump since November 2016.
Recent economic indicators, including December trade data, have shown signs of recovery in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
""Production in machinery equipment, especially semiconductor and flat panel displays, boosted the industrial output data,"" a statement by Statistics Korea showed.
From a year earlier, production gained 4.2%, also handily outpacing 1.0% forecast in the poll and logging the sharpest increase since October 2018.
Output of memory chips surged 33.8% on year, while that for machines and other transportation equipment increased 15.7% and 9.4%, respectively.
Facility investment in December jumped 10.9% from a month earlier, while it also rose 11.1% year-on-year, thanks to higher demand in chips and cars.
""Today's bullish data was mainly helped by improvement in facility investment as global uncertainties eased on the 'Phase 1' trade deal between the United States and China, as well as the policy mix of the government's expansionary fiscal policy and the Bank of Korea's easing monetary policy,"" said Ha Keon-hyeong, economist at Shinhan Investment Corp.
For the whole of 2019, industrial output fell 0.7%, the worst reading since a 6.4% dip in 1998. The drag came from facility investment which tumbled 7.6% on year as global demand cooled amid a crash in the semiconductor super-cycle.
The average factory operation rate was 72.9% in 2019, the worst since the Asian financial crisis.
""Due to the economic slowdown last year, restructuring in firms and decreased productivity pulled down the average operation rate,"" an official from Statistics Korea said.
But economists are wary that the spreading China virus could weigh on the fragile economy.
The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached 213 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in what many fear will hurt global growth.
""The concern is that if the virus spreads like the deadly SARS in 2003, the economic rebound could collapse, instead of being stagnant, so we would have to carefully see the development,"" Ha said, adding he sees the recovery momentum to be back in track around March after a temporary slowdown in January.
The statistic agency official also added that the effect of the flu-like virus, originating in the Chinese central city of Wuhan, will be reflected in January figures."

Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to help offset prolonged weakness in manufacturing, which has been weighed by weak domestic and global demand and the protracted U.S.-China trade war.
But analysts estimate the sector could take a severe hit from an outbreak of the new coronavirus, as shops, restaurants and movie theaters see a slump in sales as people avoid crowded areas.

Market research firm GfK said its index of consumer confidence rose to -9 in January from -11 in December, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists.
The survey chimed with other gauges of the economy that point to a pick-up since the Dec. 12 election in which Prime Minister Boris Johnson secured a big majority in parliament, removing some of the uncertainty hanging over businesses.
Signs of optimism among companies and consumers dissuaded the Bank of England on Thursday from cutting interest rates, and its officials cited the European Commission's gauge of consumer morale for December, which is based on the GfK survey.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ended Jan. 25, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims data for the prior week was revised to show 12,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 215,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Alabama were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,750 to 214,500 last week.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged, noting that the ""labor market remains strong"" and ""economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.""
Labor market strength is helping to keep the longest economic expansion, now in its 11th year, on track, despite a prolonged slump in business investment. The economy created 145,000 jobs last month after adding a massive 256,000 positions in November. The economy needs to create roughly 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working age population.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 44,000 to 1.70 million for the week ended Jan. 18. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims decreased 6,250 to 1.76 million.
The continuing claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed households for January's unemployment rate. The four-week average of claims dropped 51,000 between the December and January survey weeks, suggesting some improvement in the unemployment rate.
The jobless rate is near a 50-year low of 3.5% and a measure of labor market slack hit an all-time low of 6.7% in December."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy contracted for the first time in a decade last year, data showed on Thursday, as businesses reined in investment due to nagging uncertainty over the economic management of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, Latin America's no. 2 economy contracted by 0.1% in 2019 after growth of just over 2% the previous year, according to a preliminary estimate published by national statistics office INEGI.
""Today's figures essentially confirmed that Mexico was one of the world's worst-performing large emerging markets in 2019,"" said Capital Economics in a note. ""The carryover from the weak performance in 2019 will weigh on conditions this year.""
Gross domestic product (GDP) was unchanged during the fourth quarter compared to the previous three months, INEGI said. 
That, at least, was slightly better than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a contraction of 0.1%. A final estimate for the quarter will be published on Feb. 25.
Mexico's economy struggled during the first year in office of Lopez Obrador, a leftist who promised to root out corruption and chronic inequality when he took office in December 2018.
Foreign investment has held firm in Mexico under his government, but domestic businesses have been more wary.
Gross fixed capital investment fell by 5.2% on the year during the first 10 months of 2019, according to figures published by INEGI this month.
Earlier this week, Carlos Salazar, head of Mexico's powerful CCE business lobby, told a news conference that ""uncertainty"" had eaten into domestic investment last year.
However, the U.S. ratification of a new North American trade agreement this month and the roll-out of major infrastructure projects augured more positively for 2020, he added.
Capital Economics agreed but was still downbeat, arguing that growth will be ""much weaker than most expect"" and forecast the economy would only expand 0.5% this year.
Lopez Obrador's decision to cancel a partly built, $13 billion new airport for Mexico City, and his retreat from the prior government's liberalization of the oil and gas industry, have stirred widespread concern about his economic stewardship.
The president argues the airport project was tainted by corruption, but business leaders were incensed by the decision. Lopez Obrador has pledged to deliver annual growth of 4%.
The last time the Mexican economy suffered an annual contraction was during the sharp recession that engulfed the country in 2009 in the wake of the global financial crisis.
A breakdown of the latest GDP figures showed that weakness in manufacturing had fueled the downturn.
Secondary activities, which include manufacturing, slipped by 1.7% last year. Primary activities such as farming, fishing and mining rose by 1.9%, and tertiary activities, which capture services, meanwhile advanced 0.5%, the data showed. 

During the July-September period, the economy stagnated quarter-on-quarter and shrank by a tenth of a percentage point in each of the three prior quarters, INEGI said.

U.S. consumer spending moderated and business investment continued to deteriorate at the end of 2019, while a smaller trade deficit and more home construction helped keep economic growth steady.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.1% annualized rate for a second straight quarter, according to Commerce Department data Thursday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 2% growth. Consumer spending decelerated to a 1.8% pace, below projections and the weakest since the first quarter. Nonresidential business investment declined for a third straight period, the longest stretch since the last recession.

Even so, full-year GDP grew 2.3% in 2019, the slowest in three years. Economists expect growth to further moderate in 2020, as the waning effects of tax cuts and cooling wage gains make achieving Trump’s goal of sustained 3% economic expansion difficult in the late-stage expansion.
A closely watched gauge of underlying demand grew at the slowest rate of the year. So-called final sales to domestic purchasers, which exclude the volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, expanded 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Excluding government purchases, final sales advanced just 1.4%, the weakest in four years.
Fed’s Message
Slower consumption growth is consistent with the message from Federal Reserve policy makers. The Fed, in a statement Wednesday at the conclusion of a two-day policy meeting, softened its characterization of household spending growth to “moderate” from “strong” as “business fixed investment and exports remain weak.”
Business investment declined an annualized 1.5% after falling at a 2.3% pace in the previous three months. Spending on structures and equipment continued to weaken, particularly in the slumping energy sector.
Meanwhile, the autoworkers’ strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM) represented a drag on fourth-quarter growth. Motor vehicle output subtracted 0.81 percentage point from GDP, the most since late 2015, following the largest boost since 2009. GDP excluding auto production climbed 3% in the fourth quarter after 1.3% in the previous period.
At the same time, a pickup in home building helped soften the blow. Residential construction outlays increased at a 5.8% rate, the strongest in two years and following a 4.6% advance in the third quarter.
A narrowing in the trade deficit -- largely due to a sharp drop in imports amid the U.S.-China trade war -- gave a significant boost to the main GDP number. Net exports added 1.48 percentage points to growth, the most since 2009. That helped to offset a 1.09 percentage point drag from inventories.
Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred underlying inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, rose at a 1.3% annualized pace in the quarter, well below policy makers’ 2% objective.
A separate Labor Department report out Thursday showed initial filings for unemployment benefits fell by 7,000 to 216,000 in the week ended Jan. 25. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, decreased to 214,500. The historically-low figure suggests a solid labor market.
The third-quarter figures will be revised in February and March as additional source data are compiled.

German inflation accelerated to a nine-month high at the start of 2020 amid mounting signs that the economy started to stabilize.
The rate climbed to 1.6% in January, slightly below economists’ expectations. The pickup follows reports showing German unemployment unexpectedly fell this month and European manufacturers turned more optimistic.
The figures will be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which has struggled for years to keep euro-area inflation just below 2%. President Christine Lagarde said last week there were indications of a moderate increase in underlying price pressures.
Improvements on the inflation front are underpinned by a brightening economic outlook. Trade tensions have eased after the U.S. and China signed a deal, and Germany’s government this week raised its forecasts for the year.
Yet, risks remain. U.S. levies on European products are still a threat, and the outbreak of the coronavirus in China could yet impact global growth.

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 08:43AM ET</span>",U.S. economy misses Trump's 3% growth target in 2019,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy missed the Trump administration's 3% growth target for a second straight year, posting its slowest annual growth in three years in 2019 as the slump in business investment deepened amid damaging trade tensions.
The economy grew 2.3% last year, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was the slowest since 2016 and followed the 2.9% notched in 2018. The 3% growth target has remained elusive despite the White House and Republicans' $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which President Donald Trump had predicted would lift growth persistently above that target.
The department's snapshot of gross domestic product, however, showed the economy maintaining a moderate pace of growth in the fourth quarter, thanks to a smaller import bill. The report suggested the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts in 2019 helped to keep the longest expansion in history, now in its 11th year, on track and avert a downturn.
It followed on the heels of the Fed deciding to keep rates unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters on Wednesday the U.S. central bank expected ""moderate economic growth to continue"" but also nodded to some risks, including the recent coronavirus outbreak in China.
The Trump administration's 18-month-long trade war with China last year fueled fears of a recession. Though the economic outlook has improved with this month's signing of a Phase 1 deal with Beijing, economists do not see a boost to the economy as U.S. tariffs remained in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, matching the third-quarter pace, as lower borrowing costs encouraged purchases of motor vehicles, houses and other big-ticket items. Growth was also lifted by increased government spending. That helped to offset the drag from a slower pace of inventory accumulation.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP rising at a 2.1% rate in the fourth quarter. Excluding trade, inventories and government spending, the economy grew at a 1.4% rate in the fourth quarter, the slowest in four years. This measure of domestic demand rose at a 2.3% pace in the third quarter.
Economists estimate the speed at which the economy can grow over a long period without igniting inflation at around 1.8%.
The White House claimed that slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, as well as shrinking the trade deficit would boost annual GDP growth to 3.0% on an sustainable basis. Economists have long disagreed, pointing to structural issues like low productivity and population growth. Some also argued that there was historically not a very strong relationship between corporate tax rates and business investment.
Business investment fell at 1.5% rate in the fourth quarter. It was the third straight quarterly decline and the longest such stretch since 2009. There were decreases last quarter in spending on nonresidential structures and business equipment.
Trade tensions have eroded business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure. With confidence among chief executive officers remaining low in the fourth quarter after dropping to a 10-year low in the prior quarter, a rebound is unlikely soon.
Business investment is also seen pressured by Boeing's suspension this month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, which was grounded last March following two fatal crashes. Boeing (NYSE:BA) on Wednesday reported its first annual loss since 1997.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slowed to a 1.8% pace after rising at a brisk 3.2% rate in the third quarter.
A decrease in imports in the fourth quarter, in part because of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, compressed the trade deficit. Trade added 1.48 percentage points to fourth-quarter GDP growth. But the decline in imports in the fourth quarter resulted in businesses almost depleting inventories in warehouses. A 40-day strike at General Motors (NYSE:GM) also weighed on motor vehicle inventories.
Inventories rose at a $6.5 billion rate in the fourth quarter, the smallest gain since the second quarter of 2018, after increasing at a $69.4 billion pace in the July-September quarter. Inventory investment chopped 1.09 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter."
1371,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 08:19AM ET</span>",Bank of England keeps rates steady as it eyes post-election pick-up,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England kept interest rates steady on Thursday, saying signs that Britain's economy had picked up since December's election and that the global economy had stabilized meant further stimulus was not needed now.
Financial markets had seen a 50% chance of a cut, but the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) split once again 7-2 in favor of keeping Bank Rate at 0.75% with external members Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel voting to lower rates.
Sterling jumped by around half a cent against the dollar on the news, though interest rate futures still pointed to the central bank cutting rates soon, probably in May after Governor Mark Carney hands over to his successor Andrew Bailey.
Carney pointed to encouraging signs for the economy in early 2020 but said the BoE was waiting to see if this would be borne out in hard economic data.
""To be clear, these are still early days, and it is less of a case of so far so good, than so far, good enough,"" Carney said in comments to reporters following the decision.
Seema Shah, market strategist of fund manager Principal Global Investors, said Carney had seemingly deferred the next policy decision to Bailey.
""Unless economic activity data improves measurably over the coming months, reflecting proof of the so-called 'Boris bounce', and interest rate cut is likely to remain on the agenda for 2020,"" Shah added.
In a policy statement, the central bank came up with downbeat economic growth forecasts, saying Brexit would weigh on growth from next year, and it kept the door open to lower rates if the recent signs of a pick-up prove to be illusory.
""Policy may need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained or should indicators of domestic prices remain relatively weak,"" the BoE said in its quarterly Monetary Policy Report.
But if growth gathers pace as suggested by upbeat business surveys since Prime Minister Boris Johnson's unexpectedly emphatic Dec. 12 election win, ""some modest tightening"" of policy might be needed further ahead, the BoE said.
BREXIT FRICTION
The central bank no longer specified that such tightening would be ""limited and gradual"", a long-standing piece of BoE guidance that dated back to a time when a more rapid pace of rate hikes might have looked likely.
The central bank estimated Britain's economy did not grow at all in the final three months of 2019, a time of political uncertainty when parliament forced a delay to Brexit and a snap election raised the prospect of a change in government.
This will have a knock-on effect on economic growth for 2020, which the BoE forecasts will be just 0.8% for the year as a whole, the slowest since the financial crisis.
Growth is seen recovering over the year, however, reaching an annual rate of 1.2% by the final quarter of 2020.
Johnson's victory means Britain will formally leave the EU at 2300 GMT on Friday, starting an 11-month transition period during which Britain needs to negotiate a longer-term trade deal with the EU or face tariffs on its exports from 2021.
Even if this deal is reached, the BoE said it now penciled in increased trade frictions from the start of 2021, contributing to a reduction in its estimates of Britain's long-term growth potential.
Lower immigration and weaker business investment would also weigh on the economy, it added.
Investors who expect a BoE rate cut soon may also be encouraged by the central bank's subdued inflation forecast.
Inflation is seen staying below the BoE's 2% target over the next three years if rates stay at 0.75%. BoE forecasts based on market expectations of a cut in rates to 0.5% this year show inflation rising slightly above target."

1374,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 06:41AM ET</span>","Euro zone business starts year upbeat, coronavirus may sour mood","By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment jumped as confidence among manufacturers rose while unemployment was at its lowest level in more than a decade, data showed on Thursday, but the mood may quickly turn sour as fears over the coronavirus epidemic mount.
A European Commission's monthly survey said economic sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 102.8 points in January from 101.3 in December, well above the average forecast of 101.8 points in a Reuters poll of economists.
The improvement was driven by higher confidence in industry, as factory managers were more upbeat on their production expectations and their stocks of finished products.
The sector was hit hard last year by global trade wars and seems to have benefited from an initial trade deal between the United States and China signed in mid-January. 
But economists warned that the recovery in optimism may be short-lived as experts assess the fallout of the outbreak of the new coronavirus which emerged in China last month. 
The positive readings on sentiment and unemployment ""are signs that the bottom in manufacturing is now getting close"", said Bert Colijn, a senior economist at ING bank.
""One has to be cautious in interpreting these numbers though, as uncertainty around the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy is mounting,"" he said, adding that was not yet factored into these results released on Thursday.
Among euro zone's largest economies, the industry indicator rose most in Germany, the bloc's top exporter of manufactured goods and the region's biggest economy. 
But the overall industry mood remained below the long-term average both in Germany and in the euro zone. The indicator for the services sector, the largest in the euro zone, dropped slightly after three consecutive monthly rises.
The more positive business mood could be a signal of a stronger economy in the first quarter of 2020, as the euro zone leaves behind a year of weak growth.
Unemployment data supported the upbeat view, as the jobless rate dropped in the euro zone to 7.4% in December, its lowest level since May 2008, when the global financial crisis began to hit the bloc, data from the EU statistics agency Eurostat showed.
But economists remained cautious.
""Today's data do not change our view that euro zone economic growth will remain subdued, at least during the first half of this year, and that any subsequent recovery will be weaker than many anticipate,"" said Melanie Debono, economist at research firm Capital Economics. 

She said she expected the euro zone economy to grow around 0.7% this year, well below EU Commission's forecasts of a 1.2% expansion, and less than 1.1% estimated for last year.

The ECB last week reaffirmed its pledge to keep rates at rock bottom or even cut them, while also buying bonds at 20 billion euros ($22.19 billion) per month, until inflation in the euro zone headed back to its target of just under 2%.
The euro zone's central bank has fallen short of its inflation target for years. The ECB has also launched a broad review of its policy with the possible aim of redefining its main goal and how to achieve it.
A poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested German consumer price inflation, harmonized to compare with data from other European Union countries, would rise by 1.7% after an increase of 1.5% in December.
Nationwide preliminary inflation data are due at 1300 GMT.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, inflation registered 1.8% after 1.7% in December. In Bavaria, consumer prices rose by 1.5% after a 1.3% increase a month earlier.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. goods trade deficit rose sharply in December as imports rebounded and businesses became more cautious on accumulating inventory, prompting some economists to cut their fourth quarter economic growth estimates.
The housing market also provided some discouraging news on Wednesday, with contracts to purchase previously owned homes dropping by the most in more than 9-1/2 years in December. The housing market has been regaining momentum after slumping in 2018 and the first half of 2019, thanks to lower mortgage rates.
The Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates three times last year, left them unchanged on Wednesday, noting that ""economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.""
The Commerce Department said the goods trade gap, which had dropped for three straight months due to declining imports, surged 8.5% to $68.3 billion last month. 
The overall trade deficit is on track for its first annual fall since 2013, with economists saying the Trump administration's ""America First"" agenda, underscored by an 18-month trade war with China, has restricted the flow of goods, particularly imports.
Though Washington and Beijing signed a Phase 1 trade deal this month, U.S. duties remained in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two-thirds of the total.
""Despite a Phase 1 U.S.-China deal, existing tariffs, easing U.S. demand and slow global growth will keep trade sluggish,"" said James Watson, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
In December, goods imports surged 2.9% to $205.3 billion after decreasing 1.3% in November. Imports were boosted by industrial supplies, food, consumer and capital goods. Motor vehicle and parts imports, however, fell last month.
Exports of goods rose 0.3% last month to $137.0 billion after increasing 0.8% in November. There were increases in exports of industrial supplies and capital goods. Exports of consumer goods and motor vehicles and parts dropped. Food exports were unchanged last month.
The dollar was marginally firmer against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, as were U.S. Treasury prices.
Q4 GROWTH ESTIMATES CUT
The sharp widening in the goods trade deficit last month suggests the expected boost to fourth-quarter gross domestic product from trade could be a bit more moderate than initially expected. Still, the overall goods trade deficit was probably smaller relative to the July-September period.
A smaller trade gap is positive for the calculation of GDP. Trade subtracted 0.14 percentage point from GDP growth in the third quarter. The Atlanta Fed lowered its fourth quarter GDP estimate to a 1.7% pace from a 1.9% rate. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) cut its fourth-quarter GDP estimate by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.4% rate. The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday.
""It looks like the contribution to fourth-quarter GDP growth coming from trade will be more modest than we had previously anticipated,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""Details of the trade report related to the domestic absorption of capex point to equipment spending coming in a little weaker than we had estimated.""
The anticipated trade lift to GDP growth could be offset by a smaller pace of inventory accumulation relative to the third quarter. The Commerce Department also reported on Wednesday that retail inventories were unchanged in December after declining 0.8% in the prior month. Motor vehicle and parts inventories were also flat after falling 1.8% in November.
Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of GDP, were also unchanged after decreasing 0.3% in November. 
Wholesale inventories dipped 0.1% last month after gaining 0.1% in November. Inventory investment had a neutral impact on GDP growth in the third quarter.
A separate report from the National Association of Realtors showed its pending home sales index fell 4.9% in December, the biggest drop since May 2010, likely because of a shortage of houses on the market. Compared with one year ago, pending sales were up 4.6%.
Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month's decline suggests a slowdown in existing home sales, which raced to a near two-year high in December. Still, demand for homes remains strong. Another report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase a home increased 5% last week from the week before.

Cheaper borrowing costs are being offset by tight inventory, especially in the lower-priced segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages. There were a record-low 1.40 million previously owned homes on the market in December.

1378,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 03:56PM ET</span>",Fed Keeps Rates Steady as Sluggish Inflation Continues,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
 
Investing.com - The Federal Reserve held rates steady on Wednesday, as the sluggish pace of inflation coupled with a strong labor market did little to shift the central bank's outlook on the economy.
In a unanimous decision, the Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 1.5% to 1.75%. 
The Fed delivered three rate cuts in 2019, the last in October and policymakers have indicated that rates will remain on hold until there is some significant change in the economic outlook.
""The committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective,"" the Fed said in its statement. 
With the U.S. labor market in good shape, boasting record-low unemployment, the Fed has identified inflation as the main driver of future policy decisions. 
U.S. consumer prices ticked higher in December, while monthly underlying inflation slowed, supporting the Fed’s case to keep interest rates on hold at least through this year.
Looking ahead, the U.S. central bank reiterated that its future policy decisions will be led by incoming data. 
""The committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted inflation pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate,"" the Fed said.
With rates set to remain on hold, investor focus has shifted to the Fed's efforts to maintain stability in the overnight lending markets. 
In a bid to avoid fears of a liquidity crunch in short-term funding markets that led to a spike in overnight rates in September, the U.S. central bank has been buying Treasury bills of up to $60 billion a month since mid-October. The Fed confirmed that it would purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020.
Against the backdrop of a rally in markets following the Fed's repo operations, market participants have been eager for clues on whether or when the central bank expects to withdraw repo funding.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in the press conference that followed the statement said the central bank expects that the pace of bill purchases will continue until reserves reach an ample level, expected sometime in the second quarter. The pace of purchases will be gradually scaled down after enough reserves have been built up in the system.
The Fed also raised the effective fed funds rate - the interest it pays on excess reserves - by five basis points to 1.6% from 1.55% to ensure that it remains well within its targeted range of 1.5% to 1.75%. 
""Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 10 basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC's target range,"" the Fed added. 
 
The Fed has stressed that its repo funding is not a form of quantitative easing, but many disagree, pointing to the expansion in the central bank's balance sheet to $4.1 trillion from $3.8 trillion since the launch of the operation.

The shortfall in trade in goods narrowed to $852.7 billion in 2019 on a non-seasonally adjusted basis as the drop in imports outpaced the decline in exports, according to unofficial calculations by Bloomberg based on preliminary U.S. Census Bureau data released Wednesday. The official numbers are expected to be released with the full trade report due Feb. 5, which will also include trade in services.
Trump is seeking to rebalance the nation’s trading and investment relationship with other countries. The U.S. earlier this month signed the first phase of a trade deal with China, which agreed to buy an additional $200 billion in American exports.
The Senate has approved his U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement -- which he is due to sign Wednesday -- and the White House is turning its attention to scrutinizing trade relationships across other nations and regions including the European Union, the U.K. and Africa.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its pending home sales index declined 4.9% to a reading of 103.2. November's index was unrevised. Compared to one year ago, pending sales were up 4.6%.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales increasing 0.5% in December. Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator for the wellbeing of the housing market because they become sales within a couple of months.
The housing sector has largely regained momentum following a slump in 2018 through the first half of 2019 and its current strength has been supported by low mortgage rates and an unemployment rate near a 50-year low.
The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year, providing a boon to housing. The Fed is expected to keep interest rates unchanged when it announces its latest policy decision later on Wednesday and has signaled it hopes to hold rates steady for the foreseeable future.
In December, contracts fell across all the nation's four regions. Pending sales dropped 5.5% in the South and 5.4% in the West. They fell 4.0% in the Northeast and 3.6% in the Midwest.
""The state of housing in 2020 will depend on whether home builders bring more affordable homes to the market,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. ""Home prices and even rents are increasing too rapidly, and more inventory would help correct the problem and slow price gains."""

The INSEE official statistics agency said its monthly consumer confidence index rose to 104 from 102 in December, when it hit the lowest level since July as massive transport strikes erupted.
Economists polled by Reuters had on average forecast that the index would hold steady at 102, and none had expected a reading higher than 103.
Strikes against the biggest overhaul of the pension system since World War II shut down much of the French public transport for weeks in December and January.
Retailers dependent on commuter traffic in Paris saw sharp drop-offs in business through the crunch holiday spending period and only little improvement after a weak start to winter sales this month.
Nevertheless, INSEE's survey found that households were less pessimistic about their future finances and were more likely to consider that times were opportune to save more.
Households' fears about unemployment also remained low.
The Labour Ministry reported on Monday that the number of people registered as out of work fell in the fourth quarter to its lowest level since late 2013.
The improvement offers President Emmanuel Macron's government some relief as it struggles to overcome resistance to its unpopular pension reform."

Nationwide Building Society said annual house price growth in January increased to 1.9% from December's 1.4%, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, in what it called a ""modest pickup"".

House prices in January alone rose by 0.5% on the month, up from 0.1% in December and above the average forecast of a 0.3% rise.
The Bank of England will need to weigh up signs of a recent economic pick-up against an overall sluggish picture in official measures of growth at the end of last year, when it decided whether to announce an interest rate cut on Thursday.

The GfK consumer sentiment indicator, based on a survey of some 2,000 Germans, rose to 9.9 points in January, from a revised 9.7 a month earlier. This confounded a Reuters Poll of analysts of 9.6.
GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said a first deal in the trade dispute between the United States and China provided relief in Germany as an export nation dependent on a free exchange of goods.
Washington and Beijing earlier this month reached a truce in their 18-month trade war, which had slowed global economic growth and increased business uncertainty.
GfK's sub-indicator for business expectations rose slightly but remained negative at -3.7 points.
A stronger propensity to buy, stable employment and bright income expectations helped for the more cheerful mood among German consumers, GfK said.
Saving instead of consumption remains unattractive among Germans with the European Central Bank's low interest rate policy which has been pushing some banks to impose punitive interest rates on private investors, GfK added.
For 2020 as a whole, GfK forecast a 1% real growth in private consumer spending in Germany.
""The positive start of the consumer climate in 2020 confirms our assessment that private consumption will continue to be an important pillar of the German economy this year,"" Buerkl said.

1385,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 09:11PM ET</span>","South Korea's January exports seen falling faster on Lunar New Year, coronavirus to add strains: Reuters poll","By Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports are expected to fall at a faster pace in January, mainly due to fewer working days around the Lunar New Year holiday and amid concerns the new coronavirus may weigh on a fragile economic recovery, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.
Shipments in January were expected to dip 7.8% from a year earlier, extending the contraction to a 14th consecutive month, according to the median forecast of 13 economists polled. Exports fell 5.2% in December.
There were 21.5 working days in January this year because of the Lunar New Year holiday from Jan. 24 to 27, providing the month with 2.5 fewer working days than last year. The holiday fell in early February last year.
Beyond the calendar effect expected in January's data, however, most economists see exports growth turning positive in February amid signs of recovery in chip sales and Chinese demand.
""The decline in exports will likely widen in January from the previous month on fewer working days, but the export growth will turn positive in February due to opposite base effect,"" said Park Sung-woo, economist at DB Financial Investment.
Preliminary data showed South Korea's exports in the first 20 days of January fell 0.2% from a year earlier, marking the smallest decline in a year, on better chip sales.
But analysts see the contagious virus possibly piling more pressure on the trade-reliant economy.
The virus, originating in the Chinese central city of Wuhan at the end of last year, has spread to the United States, Japan, Canada, France and Germany among others. It has killed more than 100 people.
""Though we expect exports growth to turn positive in February, the rebound is unlikely to be strong given the possibility of a temporary slowdown in Chinese demand over the virus,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
""The development of the virus will serve as an important variable for recovery in South Korea's exports going further,"" Park added.
On Tuesday, South Korea's finance minister vowed to stabilize financial markets should market volatility worsen, adding that the outbreak may hit the nation's exports and economic growth.
In the same poll, 11 economists separately expect South Korea's consumer prices to rise a median 1.1% in January on-year, faster than a 0.7% gain in December.
Economists also saw industrial output in December rising a seasonally adjusted 0.5% from a month earlier.
Industrial output and trade data are due to be released on Friday and Saturday, respectively, while inflation data will be out on Feb. 4."
1386,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 08:01PM ET</span>",Australia inflation edges up but still below target,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian inflation ticked higher in the final quarter of 2019 but core measures remained subdued despite three interest rate cuts, suggesting the country's central bank will have to do more to revive consumer prices.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.7% in the December quarter, higher than forecasts of a 0.6% increase, driven by gains in cigarettes, domestic holidays, travel, fuel and fruit prices.
The annual pace rose to 1.8%, still below the floor of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2-3% target band. Indeed, a key measure of core inflation was stuck at an even slower 1.6% marking four straight years below target.
This persistent weakness was one reason the RBA cut interest rates three times last year to an all time low of 1.75%, and why markets are still pricing in at least one more easing.
The central bank holds it first policy meeting of the year next week but is thought likely to stand pat given a recent welcome dip in the unemployment rate.
Futures imply a less than 15% chance of an easing on Feb. 4, though that rises to over 70% by April.
While the rate cuts to date have succeeded in reviving home prices, consumers remain burdened by stagnant wage growth and record-high debt levels.
Weeks of raging bushfires have further darkened the mood, as has the outbreak of coronavirus and its baleful impact on Chinese tourism to Australia.
Some of the increase in prices was due to drought and lower seasonal supplies of fruit, vegetables and meat. Economists expect the bushfires and the ongoing drought to further push up prices in coming months.
Ivan Colhoun, a senior economist at NAB, estimates the fires could shave 0.4% points off economic growth this quarter, while the virus could cost A$1-2 billion in lost tourism revenue.
Both were badly timed given domestic consumers were already inclined to save rather than splurge.
""There is little evidence of either tax cuts or interest rate reductions feeding into increased consumer spending,"" noted Colhoun.
""We continue to see two further rate cuts this year and the possibility of quantitative easing if the unemployment rate deteriorates more quickly than we forecast."""

""There is no inflationary pressure coming from the high street as shoppers remain nervous about spending and discounting continues for many non-food retailers,"" Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at Nielsen, said.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 02:21PM ET</span>",Mexico posts biggest trade surplus in over 20 years on weak imports,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico posted a trade surplus of $1.283 billion in December when adjusted for seasonal swings, making for the highest annual surplus in over two decades and bolstering economic data at the close of the year, official data showed on Tuesday.
The Mexican economy has teetered on the verge of recession during the past year, crimping demand for goods imported from abroad, which has helped to swell the trade surplus.
Exports have held up better. But they too have softened in recent months, albeit without declining as fast as imports. A net surplus in exports helps make a positive contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) in national accounts.
Exports fell 2.1% in December in adjusted terms compared to the same month a year earlier, the fourth consecutive annual decline, figures published by statistics agency INEGI showed.
By contrast, imports to Mexico slipped by 5.1% on the year in December for a seventh month in succession.
The weakness of imports has widened Mexico's current account and reduced local demand for U.S. dollars, lifting the peso currency against the greenback.
However, weak investment has held back domestic demand, and a poll by Reuters this week forecast the economy had contracted 0.1% in the fourth quarter.
Mexico will publish a preliminary estimate for fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday.
In adjusted terms, Mexico's trade surplus was around $6.1 billion last year, the highest since 1996, INEGI data show. That compared with a trade deficit of some $13.3 billion in 2018.
In unadjusted terms, Mexico posted a trade surplus of nearly $3.1 billion in December, the data showed.
""Going forward, the non-oil trade balance is likely to continue to benefit from a competitive currency, weak final domestic demand conditions (particularly investment), and the forecast firming of external demand,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos in a note to clients."

The gauge jumped to 20 in January, the highest since September 2018, from minus 5 a month earlier, the Richmond Fed reported on Tuesday. It marked the largest monthly advance since March 2016.
The report offers hope for U.S. manufacturing in 2020 after separate data earlier Tuesday showed orders for business equipment fell in December, capping a year of subdued investment. The Philadelphia Fed and New York Fed earlier this month reported manufacturing gauges that were the highest since May.
The Richmond Fed’s measure of shipments, or sales, jumped to the highest level since March 2004. Its gauge of new orders increased to an 11-month high. Employment at mid-Atlantic factories expanded at the fastest pace since March 2019.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 0.9% last month as demand for machinery, primary metals and electrical equipment, appliances and components declined.
That was the largest decrease since April. Data for November was revised lower to show these so-called core capital goods orders edging up 0.1% instead of gaining 0.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods would be unchanged in December.
Core capital goods orders rose 0.8% on a year-on-year basis in December.
Shipments of core capital goods decreased 0.4% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They declined by an unrevised 0.3% in November.
Business investment has contracted for two straight quarters and likely remained in the red in the fourth quarter, subtracting from GDP growth. The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.8% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period.
The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday.
Business investment had been weighed down by steep declines in both spending on equipment and nonresidential structures such as gas and oil well drilling. That has landed manufacturing in recession. Capital expenditure has been undercut by the White House's 18-month trade war with China, which has hurt business confidence.
Though tensions have eased with the signing this month of a ""Phase 1"" trade deal between Washington and Beijing, manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, is not yet out of the woods. Boeing (NYSE:BA) BA.N this month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner. The aircraft has been grounded since last March following two fatal crashes.
Though airlines have continued to submit orders, there have been no deliveries, leading to a rise in inventories at factories. Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years is already causing ripple effects down the supply chain. Boeing's biggest supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings SPR.N, said early this month it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita, Kansas base.
Economists estimate the production suspension could slice at least half a percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth.
In December, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rebounded 2.4% after tumbling 3.1% in the prior month.
They were boosted by a 7.6% surge in orders for transportation equipment, which followed an 8.3% drop in November. Orders for defense aircraft and parts soared 168.3% last month, offsetting a 74.7% plunge in demand for civilian aircraft. Boeing reported on its website that it had received only three commercial aircraft orders in December, down from 63 in November. December is normally a strong month for orders.
Motor vehicles and parts orders fell 0.9% in December."

National Australia Bank's (AX:NAB) index of business conditions dipped a point to +3 in December, again short of the long-run average of +6.
The survey's volatile measure of business confidence fell 2 points to -2, with sales and profitability both deteriorating. The one bright spot was the index of employment, which held at +4 in December, mirroring official data on jobs that have topped expectations in the past couple of months.
""Conditions continue to imply a stalling in the private sector and we think that the survey suggests that there was another weak outcome in the December quarter,"" said NAB Group Chief Economist Alan Oster.
""For now, the survey has not showed clear evidence of a bushfire impact, but the more significant impact is likely to have occurred in January.""
The fires grew steadily through the month, hurting tourism and consumer sentiment at the peak of the holiday period.
""Conditions appear to have bottomed, but our forward-looking indicators suggest they are likely to remain weak,"" Oster said. ""We think that more policy stimulus will be needed to boost the economy over 2020.""
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates three times last year to a record low 0.75%, boosting home prices but having only limited success in spurring spending.
Financial markets are wagering on at least one more quarter-point cut by the middle of this year, though most doubt the central bank will move at its first meeting of the year on Feb. 4.
NAB's survey showed mixed conditions across industries, with large gains for wholesale and mining offset by falls in finance and business & property services.
Confidence declined in retail and construction, while the service industries were more buoyant.
There was little sign of inflationary pressure, with retail prices rising a modest 0.5% in the December quarter."

HAVANA (Reuters) - Chinese exports to Cuba fell to their lowest level in a decade last year at $791 million, according to data from the Chinese Customs Office, as the island nation remained mired in a liquidity crisis.
The Communist-run country is dependent on imports for much of its consumption, but it began falling behind on payments to foreign suppliers from 2015 as support ebbed from ally Venezuela due to its own economic woes. 
Cuba's economy stagnated further in recent years due to new sanctions introduced by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump aimed at foreign investment and financing, oil supplies, tourism and other revenue sources.
China remains one of Cuba's top political allies and economic partners, with investments in alternative energy and development financing in light industry, communications and other areas.
However, the Chinese data showed that exports to Cuba had declined from nearly $1.9 billion in 2015 and $1.1 billion as recently as 2018. 
Cuba has yet to report trade data for last year. In 2018, the last year for which data is available, Cuba reported total exports of goods and services of $14.5 billion and imports $12.6 billion. 
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who took office in 2018, has cut imports, imposed austerity measures and called on state-run companies to move from an ""import to export mentality"".
The government last reported its foreign debt was $18 billion in 2016, of which more than $5.5 billion was to suppliers. Cuba’s debt to China is estimated at billions of dollars.
The Cuban government did not respond to questions for this story. The Chinese commercial office in Havana could not be reached for comment.
The decline in Chinese exports contrasts with that of Russia and the European Union, two other important economic partners where exports have increased in recent years, according to the Russian government and EU authorities.
""China's lowered profile may reflect Beijing's increasing dissatisfaction with Cuba's unwillingness to embark on a more coherent economic reform course,"" Bert Hoffman, a Latin America expert at the German Institute of Global and Area Studies, said.
Cuban exports to China have increased in recent years, reaching $492 million in 2019, mainly sugar and nickel.

China sends a broad array of supplies to Cuba, from machinery and transportation equipment to raw materials, chemicals and food.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell unexpectedly in December, likely held down by a shortage of more affordable homes, but lower mortgage rates supported the overall housing market.
The U.S. Commerce Department report on Monday also showed downward revisions to sales for the prior three months, bucking a recent streak of fairly strong housing data. Strength in housing, following a slump in 2018 through the first half of 2019, could offset some of the drag on economic growth from weakness in business spending and manufacturing.
New home sales slipped 0.4% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 694,000 units, with sales in the South dropping to the lowest in more than a year. It was the third straight monthly decline in sales. November's sales pace was revised down to 697,000 units from the previously reported 719,000. September and October sales were also marked down.
""Low mortgage rates, a robust labor market and stabilizing geopolitical tensions suggest that demand for housing will stick around, and buyers are hungry for more housing options,"" said Matthew Speakman, economist at online real estate firm Zillow.
Sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. New homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for only 10% of sales.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.1 % of housing market sales, would increase 1.5% to a pace of 730,000 units in December.
The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell, tracking a broadly weaker U.S. stock market as investors worried about the economic fallout of the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak in China that has prompted the country to extend the Lunar New Year holidays and businesses to close some operations. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rallied.
VOLATILE DATA
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales jumped 23.0% from a year ago. For all of 2019, new home sales increased 10.3% to 681,000 units, the highest since 2007.
Cheaper mortgage rates have supported the housing market since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.60% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Officials from the U.S. central bank are scheduled to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. They are expected to reiterate the Fed's desire to keep rates unchanged at least through this year, which could limit further declines in mortgage rates. Still, economists are optimistic the housing market will remain solid.
""Household formation trends are running ahead of new housing construction and this will buoy the housing market in 2020,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Reports this month showed sales of previously owned homes jumped to near a two-year high in December and housing starts raced to a 13-year peak. Though permits for future construction of single-family housing permits fell in December, that followed seven straight monthly gains.
Housing is expected to have contributed to GDP growth again in the fourth quarter. Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.8% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP on Thursday.
""We still think that real residential investment posted a decent gain in the fourth quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The housing sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes, especially in the lower-priced segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages.
That is keeping prices elevated. The median new house price rose 0.5% to $331,400 in December from a year ago. New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, dropped 15.4% in December to a rate of 347,000 units, the lowest since October 2018. Sales declined 11.8% in the Northeast, but rose 10.1% in the Midwest and surged 31.0% in the West.
There were 327,000 new homes on the market last month, up 1.6% from November. At December's sales pace it would take 5.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.5 months in November.

Single-family home sales fell 0.4% to a 694,000 annualized pace, the weakest since July and below all economist estimates in Bloomberg's survey, while the November figure was revised down to 697,000, government data showed Monday. The median sales price edged up 0.5% from a year earlier to $331,400.
Key Insights

Despite signs of softening, new-home sales remain near post-recession highs amid lower borrowing costs following three Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts last year. Recent strength, however, has boosted residential construction, and in turn helped contribute more to gross domestic product.
Other recent reports have indicated fresh strength in housing. Existing home sales, which account for about 90% of U.S. housing, jumped in December to the best pace in nearly two years amid the leanest inventories on record. Pending home sales also have remained resilient.

Get More

Purchases of new homes fell in the South, the largest region, and the Northeast, while they climbed in the Midwest and West. 
Economists in Bloomberg's survey projected an annualized pace of 730,000 new-home sales for November. Estimates ranged from 700,000 to 764,000.
There were signs that the inventory squeeze may get some relief. The supply of homes at the current sales rose to 5.7 months from 5.5 months in the prior month, while the number of properties sold for which construction hadn’t yet started increased to a six-month high of 214,000.
New-home purchases account for about 10% of the market and are calculated when contracts are signed. They are considered a timelier barometer than purchases of previously-owned homes, which are calculated when contracts close. 
The figures, which tend to be volatile, are published jointly by the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

LONDON (Reuters) - New York remains the world's top financial center, pushing London further into second place as Brexit uncertainty undermines the UK capital and Asian centers catch up, a survey from consultants Duff & Phelps said on Monday.
Britain will leave the European Union on Friday with future access to its biggest financial services customer uncertain after a business-as-usual transition period ends in December.
The Global Regulatory Outlook survey of 245 senior officials from asset management, banking and other financial firms from across the world found that New York has extended its lead over London.
It said 56% of respondents regard the U.S. financial capital as the world's most important money hub, up 33 percentage points over the past two years. Only 33% currently see London as the foremost global  financial  hub, down more than 20 percentage points over the last two years.
""It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that three years of uncertainty since the Brexit vote has contributed to London’s fall,"" said Monique Melis, managing director at Duff & Phelps.
Both New York and London are set to lose ground over the next five years, with emerging centers in Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai expected to see the biggest growth, the survey showed.
Just 22% predict London would still be the major financial center in five years' time, the survey showed. Few respondents see Paris, Frankfurt or any other European city coming close to replacing New York or London.
Respondents favored London over New York in terms of the most favorable regulatory regime for financial services in the world.
""If the Government can position the UK as having a more favorable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,"" Melis said.

London has shown resilience since Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU by leapfrogging New York to become the top center for trading interest rate swaps and remaining leader in currency trading.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 04:06AM ET</span>",Business survey suggests U.S. labor market may have peaked,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There is an even balance in the share of U.S. businesses reporting decreases and increases in employment for the first time in a decade, a survey showed on Monday, the latest suggestion that the labor market has likely peaked and job growth could slow this year.
The findings of the National Association for Business Economics' (NABE) fourth-quarter business conditions survey followed on the heels of a government report this month showing job openings falling by the most in more than four years in November.
""For the first time in a decade, there are as many respondents reporting decreases as increases in employment at their firms than in the previous three months,"" said NABE Business Conditions Survey Chair Megan Greene. 
""However, this may have been due to difficulty finding workers rather than a pullback in demand.""
The survey is based on the responses of 97 NABE members on business conditions in their companies or industries. It was conducted between Dec. 23 and Jan 8. and reflects conditions in the fourth quarter and the near-term outlook.
According to the survey, the declines in employment were in the services, goods-producing and transportation, utilities, information, and communications industries. There were gains in employment in the finance, insurance, and real estate sectors.
Though job growth remains solid and more than enough to keep the unemployment rate low, momentum has slowed from the brisk pace experienced at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019.
The government last August estimated that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade. 
That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. Economists expect job gains beyond March 2019 could also be revised lower. 
The slowdown in employment gains has been blamed on worker shortages and trade tensions, especially the U.S-China trade war. The NABE survey showed a significant increase in the percentage of companies reporting shortages of unskilled labor, while nearly half reported shortages of skilled workers. 
""While most respondents suggest their firms have not felt much impact from the tariffs and countermeasures over the past year, respondents from goods-producing firms report their companies have experienced negative sales and higher costs,"" said Greene, who is also a senior fellow at the Harvard University's Kennedy School of government.
The survey also offered some clues on why wages have not increased significantly despite worker shortages. Forty-seven percent of respondents reported raising wages, while 44% said they were training internal staff for promotion. Businesses were also investing in labor-saving processes, with the share of respondents citing this measure rising to 36% in January from 34% in October and 22% in January 2019. 

Overall, businesses were more upbeat about the economy over the next 12 months than in October, with 30% of respondents expecting the economy to grow between 2.1% and 3.0% this year. That compared with a share of 20% in October.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson's emphatic December election win has triggered a burst of optimism among British businesses and consumers, weakening the case for a Bank of England interest rate cut this week.
Johnson's success in securing a large parliamentary majority, which ended a period of deadlock in Westminster, means Britain will leave the European Union on Jan. 31 and start an 11-month, no-change transition period.
Although it remains to be seen if the pickup in confidence will translate into a meaningful boost to growth, economists have been heartened by the range of indicators that have perked up over the last month.
At the end of 2019, signs of weakness in the labor market prompted two BoE rate-setters to vote for lower borrowing costs. Three others, including Governor Mark Carney, hinted recently that more economic stimulus might be needed.
But of the data published so far this year, arguably only retail sales for December were a disappointment.
Below are some of the early signals for the economy in 2020 that members of the Monetary Policy Committee will weigh up before Thursday's announcement.
PMI JUMPS IN JAN
British companies are enjoying their best month in more than a year, according to the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), the strongest evidence yet of a post-election economic boost.
The survey showed growth across services companies resumed in January for the first time since August, while a downturn in manufacturing eased. The PMI reading bettered the euro zone's for the first time since December 2018.
The PMI followed a Confederation of British Industry survey that pointed to a record jump in confidence among manufacturers.

CFOs CHEER UP
Accountants Deloitte said 53% of chief financial officers were more optimistic about their companies' prospects than three months previously, the highest share since records started in 2008.
It survey was conducted entirely after the election.

CONSUMERS MORE CONFIDENT
The public became much more upbeat about the prospects for Britain's economy after the election, according to a survey commissioned by payment card company Barclaycard.
The proportion who said they were confident about the economy's future rose 10 points to 41%, the highest since March 2017, according to the survey of 2,000 people conducted by Longitude Research from Dec. 17 to 19.
However, there are doubts as to how much consumer confidence in the economy really matters.
Britons have been among the most downbeat of all European Union consumers, according to European Commission data, but their spending has continued to power growth.
And while the Barclaycard survey showed an increase in optimism among consumers, the British Retail Consortium reported dismal Christmas trading for major store chains.

JOBS BOOST?
British employers increased hiring of permanent staff from job agencies last month for the first time in a year, a survey from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) showed, another sign of higher business confidence.
The survey was conducted Dec. 5 to Dec. 17, straddling the election result.
""With a new government in place and the path ahead looking more predictable, some businesses have decided that they have waited long enough,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 10:11AM ET</span>",Canadian retail sales jump 0.9% on higher auto sales,"By Kelsey Johnson
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales rose a higher-than-expected 0.9% in November, largely offsetting October's decline, Statistics Canada said on Friday, as sales picked up at motor vehicle and parts dealers as well as food and beverage stores.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 0.4% for overall sales. Statistics Canada revised October's decline down slightly to 1.1% from an initial 1.2%.
Sales excluding autos rose 0.2% in November, the agency noted, lower than the 0.4% gain predicted by analysts.
""November's retail sales figures did nothing to lift the fog of uncertainty surrounding the health of the Canadian consumer,"" said Andrew Grantham, a senior economist with CIBC Capital Markets, in a note.
""With other elements of discretionary spending largely weaker on the month, we still think there’s enough concern regarding the consumer outlook to warrant an interest rate cut by April, particularly if the unemployment rate starts to nudge higher,"" he added.
Earlier this week, the Bank of Canada, which has held its overnight interest rate steady for more than a year, opened the door to a possible rate cut if a recent slowdown in domestic growth persisted.
Recent economic data, the bank said, had been mixed, adding it would pay particular attention to developments in consumer spending, the housing market and business investment going forward. Money markets now see about a 24% chance of a rate cut in March. [BOCWATCH]
While the uptick reported in Friday's sales data breaks a string of lackluster economic figures for November, including disappointing manufacturing and wholesale trade numbers, RBC Senior Economist Nathan Janzen said the data likely won't change the Bank of Canada's thinking just yet.
""The central bank will rightly be more focused on economic data releases until it becomes clear whether recent faltering is a sign of underlying fundamental deterioration, or yet another statistical blip in what is often volatile Canadian economic data,"" he said in a note.
Statscan said motor vehicle and parts dealer sales rose 3.0%, led primarily by new car dealers, who saw a 2.8% increase in sales.
Meanwhile, food and beverage store receipts increased by 0.9% in November, largely thanks to increased sales at grocery stores, which jumped 1.3%.
Six of the 11 subsectors tracked by Statistics Canada saw an increase, accounting for 70% of all retail trade. In volume terms, retail sales grew by 0.7%."
1401,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>","Thailand's 2019 foreign tourists up 4%; China virus, strong baht a risk","By Orathai Sriring
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand saw slower growth of foreign tourist arrivals of 4.2% last year and the outlook for a lucrative industry is weighed by strength in the baht and China's new coronavirus at a time of faltering economic growth.
Tourist receipts account for about 12 percent of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, making it one of the most important drivers of growth for an economy that has lagged most regional peers for years.
Foreign tourist arrivals hit a record 39.8 million last year - equivalent to more than half of Thailand's population - after a rise of 7% to 38.2 million in 2018, when a boat accident killed dozens of Chinese tourists, tourism ministry data showed.
Tourist revenue had risen 3% to 1.93 trillion baht ($63.49 billion) in 2019.
Visitors from China, Thailand's biggest source of tourists, increased by 4.4% to 10.99 million in 2019.
The growth in foreign arrivals had slowed and missed a government target, and industry operators have blamed that on the strong baht, Asia's top performer last year.
The baht rose nearly 9% against the U.S. dollar and about 11% against China's yuan last year.
(GRAPHIC - Thailand's overall foreign tourists and Chinese arrivals: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1492/1467/Thailand's%20foreign%20tourists.png)
The Tourism Council of Thailand last week forecast less than 5% growth in overall foreign tourist numbers this year.
Kasikorn Research Centre on Friday predicted the number of Chinese tourists may fall 0.5%-2.0% this year, rather than the 1.6%-3.5% increase projected earlier.
China's coronavirus has added to the concerns. Thailand on Friday confirmed its fifth case of the virus and Saturday's start of the Lunar New Year holiday is expected to bring an influx of Chinese travelers.
""The outbreak of coronavirus is a risk. The strong Thai baht may also affect tourism growth,"" said Tim Leelahaphan, economist of  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN).
""That is unlikely to help an already-slowing economy,"" he said adding he expected the central bank to cut its policy rate by a quarter point in the first quarter.
The Bank of Thailand (BOT) cut the key rate twice in 2019, taking it to a record low of 1.25%. It will next review monetary policy on Feb. 5.
The BOT forecast economic growth of 2.8% this year, slightly picking up from an estimated 2.5% in 2019, a 5-year low."

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies are enjoying their best month in more than a year, a survey indicated on Friday, the strongest evidence yet of a post-election boost to the economy that could keep the Bank of England from cutting interest rates next week.
The flash readings of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) indicated that British services resumed growing in January for the first time since August, while a downturn in manufacturing eased. The PMI reading bettered the euro zone's for the first time since December 2018
The index suggested the British economy was on track to grow around 0.2% in quarterly terms after slowing to a crawl late last year.
Earlier signs of weakness in the labor market had prompted two Bank of England rate-setters to vote for lower borrowing costs at the end of last year. Three others, including Governor Mark Carney, hinted recently that more economic stimulus might be needed.
Friday's data corroborated earlier signs that uncertainty among businesses and consumers has been tempered by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election victory last month.
The composite PMI, which combines manufacturing and services indexes, rose to 52.4 from 49.3, the highest reading since September 2018 and easily beating the 50.6 consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
""The big jump in the composite PMI - the fifth largest month-to-month gain since the survey started in 1998 - makes it likely, though not absolutely certain, that the BoE will pause for thought next week,"" said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, sterling weakened and British government bond yields touched three-month lows after the data. Financial markets calculated that the Bank of England would cut interest rates next week at just over a 50% chance. 
The services PMI rose in January to 52.9 from 50.0, also its highest level since September 2018 and above the consensus forecast of 51.0 in a Reuters poll.
(GRAPHIC - UK services PMI and Bank of England rates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/665/657/onr.png) 
Service-sector optimism rose to its highest in nearly five years this month, chiming with other business surveys from the Confederation of British Industry and Deloitte.
Still, the services PMI remained at levels historically associated with additional stimulus from the Bank of England and below the survey's long-run average of 54.8.
The reading for British manufacturing, which accounts for 10% of the British economy, was also better than expected, rising to 49.8 from 47.5, its highest since April. It remained still below the 50 mark that signaled contraction for a ninth month, but new orders increased for the first time since April.

""The uplift in sentiment about the outlook hints at even better growth to come, but confidence needs to continue to rise to ensure this solid start to the year has legs,"" IHS Markit's chief business economist Chris Williamson said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity remained lacklustre at the start of the year, a survey showed a day after the European Central Bank said the manufacturing sector remained a drag on the economy, but there were some glimmers of hope for policymakers.
ECB rate-setters did not make any policy change on Thursday, standing by their pledge to keep buying bonds and, if needed, cut interest rates until price growth in the euro zone heads back to their goal.
Still, the slowdown in euro zone economic activity has probably bottomed out, according to a Reuters poll last week, which showed while the outlook for growth and inflation remained lukewarm the chances of a recession have faded. [ECILT/EU]
That outlook was somewhat supported by IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, which held at 50.9 in January but missed the median prediction in a Reuters poll for 51.2.
Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The unchanged reading for the euro zone's Composite PMI in January leaves it still consistent with fairly slow GDP growth,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Following Friday's PMI, the euro continued to languish near a seven-week low after the ECB's more dovish tone at Thursday's meeting than some had expected. 
An earlier PMI from Germany, Europe's largest economy, showed the private sector gained momentum as growth in services activity picked up and the pullback in manufacturing eased.
French activity expanded at a weaker pace as nationwide strikes weighed and IHS Markit cautioned growth outside of Germany and France slowed to a six-and-a-half year low.
Britain's performance bettered the euro zone's for the first time since December 2018, a separate PMI showed, the strongest evidence yet of a post-election boost to the economy that could deter the Bank of England from cutting interest rates next week. [GB/PMIS]
The euro zone's headline index was bogged down by a still struggling factory industry. The manufacturing PMI marked the 12th month below the break-even mark, registering 47.8 - albeit an improvement on December's 46.3 and well above the Reuters poll's 46.8.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 47.5 from 46.1, its highest since August.
While most forward-looking indicators in the manufacturing PMI remained in negative territory, they were moving in the right direction. The new orders, employment, backlogs of work and quantity of purchases indexes were all still sub-50 but did rise.
""With manufacturing showing early signs of recovery and the service sector continuing to grow, chances of a recession are receding further,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
However, the PMI for the bloc's dominant services industry weakened to 52.2 from 52.8, confounding expectations for no change. 
And possibly of concern to policymakers, demand weakened suggesting there won't be a significant turnaround anytime soon. The services new business index fell to 51.5 from 52.1.
But optimism about the year ahead bounced. The composite future output index climbed to 61.2 from 59.4, its highest reading since September 2018.

Consumer confidence remained unchanged in January from December, official flash figures released on Thursday showed.

IHS Markit’s composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for the region stayed at 50.9 in January, falling short of the 51.2 median forecast of economists. There was a drag from France, where strikes hit the services sector, which offset an improvement in Germany.
Weakness also persisted elsewhere in the region, with output growth there slowing to the lowest in six and half years. IHS Markit didn’t provide further details, and figures for other countries will only be available early next month.
The euro-area services PMI slipped slightly in January, while the manufacturing index rose to a nine-month high of 47.8. That’s still at a level signalling contraction and the report also said factories continued to cut jobs.
On the upside, confidence across the private sector improved, thanks in part to a more upbeat manufacturing industry. Sentiment there jumped for a fifth month on hopes that the economy is past the worst of the recent downturn.
On Thursday, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde offered a similar view, saying that downside risks to the economic outlook are “somewhat less pronounced.”"

These figures are likely to have added importance as they are the first piece of leading data to be released following the country's General Election.

IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, rose to 51.1 from 50.2 the previous month.
It was the highest reading in five months and beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts who had expected a smaller increase to 50.5.
The figures suggest that ""the storm clouds over the German economy may be starting to clear"", said IHS Markit economist Phil Smith. He added that the manufacturing sector moved closer to stabilization while services posted robust growth.
""Demand has started to firm up a little both at home and abroad, which is reflected in a first rise in new business for seven months,"" Smith said.
Business expectations also improved, with optimism among manufacturers reaching its highest level in 1-1/2 years, the survey showed.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 10:52PM ET</span>","Japan December core consumer inflation ticks up, but far from BOJ's target","By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices rose in December from a year earlier, data showed on Friday, nudging up from the previous month, but inflation was still well short of the central bank's elusive 2% target.
The tame data, which was also boosted by a sales tax increase last October, underscored the challenge faced by the country's central bank, which was expected to maintain its current stimulus policy, analysts said.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil costs but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.7% in December from a year earlier, the government data showed, matching a media forecast. In November, the index rose 0.5%.
The data release came after the BOJ on Tuesday revised down its consumer price forecasts, despite the central bank having nudged up its economic growth projections.
The BOJ kept its policy unchanged this week and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated the central bank's resolve to maintain its ultra-easy policy in light of soft inflation and lingering uncertainty abroad.
""Factors such as a labor shortage and a sales tax hike have helped corporations to raise prices ... but we expect consumer inflation will hover sideways on sluggish wage recovery,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
""The BOJ has downgraded its consumer prices inflation projections but they are still rosy numbers. We expect the central bank will keep its current pace of stimulus policy.""
The so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes fresh food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, grew 0.9% in December from a year earlier, the fastest pace of growth since March 2016.
The index rose 0.8% in November.
A pickup in the core-core CPI, closely watched by the BOJ as a key measurement on the broad inflation trend, reflected price rises including for sweets, some prepared foods and restaurant meals, an official said.
Without the impact of a sales tax hike to 10% from 8% in October, core CPI index rose only 0.4% in December from a year earlier and the core-core inflation index grew 0.6%, the data showed.
""Consumer spending is expected to pick up after the sales tax hike dented it but the spending will unlikely be strong enough to boost consumer prices,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The nation's economy expanded at an annualized 1.8% in the third quarter thanks to resilient domestic demand and business spending.
But exports fell for a 13th straight month in December, hurt by U.S.-bound shipments of cars, construction and mining machinery, suggesting weak external demand is likely to remain a drag on the trade-reliant economy for a while longer.
Analysts expect the economy probably shrank in the fourth quarter as October's sales tax hike hit consumer spending.
The central bank could consider later this year watering down its commitment to keep or cut its rock-bottom interest rates, if pessimism over the global outlook continues to recede, sources say."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, suggesting the labor market continues to tighten even as job growth is slowing.
Labor market strength is underpinning consumer spending, helping to keep the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track, despite a downturn in manufacturing.
""Employers are not cutting positions outside of the normal churn of the labor market and workers are incredibly confident in their job prospects, and not taking the time to file a claim if they are laid off,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended Jan. 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims had declined for five straight weeks, resulting in the unwinding of the surge seen in early December, which was blamed on a later-than-normal Thanksgiving Day.
Claims data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 215,000 in the latest week. 
The Labor Department said claims for Alabama, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Puerto Rico and Virginia were estimated because of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, which left authorities with less time to compile the data.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 213,250 last week, the lowest level since September.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with investors focusing their attention elsewhere. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank left unchanged its key interest rates and stimulus programs. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street fell on rising worries over the coronavirus outbreak in China.
JOB GROWTH SLOWING
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report. 
The four-week moving average of claims dropped 12,500 between the December and January survey periods, suggesting some pickup in job growth this month.
The economy created 145,000 jobs last month after adding a massive 256,000 positions in November. The slowdown in job growth has been blamed on a shortage of workers and ebbing demand in some industries like manufacturing, which has been hammered by trade tensions and problems at Boeing (N:BA).
Boeing this month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, with ripple effects down the supply chain. Boeing's biggest supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (N:SPR) said early this month it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita, Kansas base. 
Despite the low level of claims, the data have been showing layoffs in manufacturing, as well as transportation and warehousing, construction, educational service and accommodation and food services industries from late 2019 through mid-January. 
That fits in with the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, which last week showed ""most districts cited widespread labor shortages as a factor constraining job growth,"" and ""a number of districts reported job cuts or reduced hiring among manufacturers,"" as well as ""scattered reports of job cuts in the transportation and energy sectors,"" at the tail end of 2019.
""The jury is out on whether this signals a soft patch for the monthly payroll figures in January,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Despite the moderation in job gains, the labor market remains on solid footing, with the unemployment rate holding near a 50-year low of 3.5% in December and a measure of labor market slack dropping to an all-time low of 6.7%.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 37,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Jan. 11. The so-called continuing claims had surged to 1.80 million at the end of 2019, which was the highest level since April 2018. The jump was blamed on year-end volatility.

The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims increased 2,000 to 1.76 million in the most recent week.

In the year through early January, inflation was 3.18%, up from 3.02% in the second half of December, taking the rate to its highest since the first half of August. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast an inflation rate of 3.17%.
Prices were lifted by the higher cost of some seasonal foodstuff in particular, the data showed.
Mexico's central bank targets an inflation rate of 3%, with a one-percentage-point tolerance threshold above and below.

""The Governing Council...decided to launch a review of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy. Further details about the scope and timetable of the review will be published in a press release today at 15:30 CET,"" the ECB said.
It reaffirmed its pledge to keep rates at rock bottom or even cut them, while also buying bonds at 20 billion euros per month, until inflation in the euro zone headed back to its target of just under 2%.
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics,"" the ECB said.
The statement was effectively unchanged from December, suggesting a stabilization in euro zone economic data had been deemed insufficient to tighten the ECB's ultra-easy message.
Attention now turns to Christine Lagarde's second news conference as ECB president at 1330 GMT, where she will announce the scope of the bank's strategic review.
This will last months and span topics from the inflation target to digital money and the fight against climate change.
Investors will be looking for clues to whether the review will see Lagarde cement her predecessor's legacy of monetary largesse, or if she will use it to acknowledge worries that years of easy credit have fueled financial bubbles.
With Thursday's decision, the ECB's rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, remains at a record low of -0.50%.

The main objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability in the euro area, but inflation has been consistently below the central bank’s target range, defined under the current strategy as a consumer price index of ""close to, but below, 2%"" over the medium term."
1413,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Four of five Bank of Israel MPC members voted to hold key rate,"By Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Four of the five rate setters at the Bank of Israel voted to keep the benchmark interest rate at 0.25% on Jan. 9, minutes of the discussions showed on Thursday.
The fifth member supported a reduction to 0.1%.
Monetary policy committee members (MPC) said there was no reason to lower rates given solid economic growth, a tight labor market, inflation that is expected to move back into its 1-3% target range in a year, and the U.S. and European central banks apparently having exhausted rate reductions for now.
Still, the four who voted for steady rates acknowledged risks to economic activity and inflation were significant and ""that to the extent needed, the bank will continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market"".
""Three of them even noted that there may be a need to enhance the extent of monetary policy accommodation going forward,"" the minutes said.
Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said on Jan. 9 that there needed to be a more significant deterioration in economic activity for the central bank to lower rates.
The member voting for a cut argued that the shekel's appreciation could adversely impact economic activity and a continued decline in the inflation rate, which was 0.6% in 2019.
In addition, ""the moderation of economic activity worldwide is a significant risk, and that together with the expected impact of the fiscal contraction, requires an enhancement of the level of monetary accommodation,"" the member said.
The MPC agreed that using an interim budget due to an ongoing political stalemate would likely have a moderating impact on the economy this year, along with uncertainty regarding policies after the March 2 election.
Policymakers have said they prefer intervention in the foreign exchange market to rate cuts. The bank has bought more than $3.5 billion of foreign currency since its prior decision on Nov. 25.
""The Bank of Israel is prepared to prevent anomalous appreciation of the shekel by purchasing foreign exchange whenever necessary, and particularly if it will derive from relatively short-term financial factors,"" the minutes said."
1414,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>",Australia’s Unemployment Rate Unexpectedly Falls to 5.1% in December,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian unemployment unexpectedly declined in December as the labor market persisted in defying a sluggish economy, prompting a surge in the currency as traders slashed bets on an interest-rate cut.
The jobless rate declined to 5.1%, compared with economists estimates for it to hold steady at 5.2%. Employment rose by 28,900 people -- almost triple estimates -- while participation remained at 66%. Bushfires resulted in “disruption to data collection” in New South Wales, Victoria and the A.C.T.
The currency jumped more than half a percent as traders are now pricing in just a 24% chance of a rate cut next month, from 56% late Wednesday. The data extend a three-year run of hiring strength that has withstood volatility offshore and a slowdown at home.
Yet the job market’s health has failed to significantly push unemployment down to a level that would spark faster wages growth as it coincided with a swelling labor force. This led the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut rates three times since June to try to buttress investment and drive faster economic growth.
“These labor market figures will be interpreted in a positive manner,” said Callam Pickering, an economist at global jobs website Indeed Inc. who previously worked at the central bank. “However, with the bushfires likely to disrupt economic activity, and the with the Reserve Bank already leaning towards cuts, we expect further easing in the months to come.”
The Australian dollar surged to 68.79 U.S. cents following the report, up 0.6% from before the release. It was trading at 68.70 U.S. cents at 12:41 p.m. Sydney.
Indeed, the rise in employment was solely part-time, with full-time positions falling by 300, suggesting Christmas-related hiring.
Other details included:
New South Wales and Victoria, the most populous states, led the employment gains, with 20,600 and 10,300 respectively;The mining hub of Western Australia, which has struggled since the end of the resources boom, led losses with 5,300;Under-employment held at 8.3%Governor Philip Lowe’s policy easing has so far delivered few results outside reinvigorating house price growth. He maintains “long and variable lags” in monetary policy mean it will take time for stimulus to work its way through the economy.
Consumer confidence fell 1.8% this month in response to the bushfire crisis, heading further into negative territory. While households are concerned about the economy, they are less pessimistic about their current and future financial situation -- a good indicator of a healthy jobs market.
Moreover, rising property prices are a necessary forerunner to an eventual recovery in residential construction and in the shorter term should bring a wealth effect that supports consumption.
The RBA’s cash rate is at a record low 0.75% and Lowe estimates the lower bound at 0.25%, meaning he has just two cuts left in his policy arsenal before unconventional policy becomes a possibility.
The U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent pause after 75 basis points of rate cuts reduces the risk of the currency suddenly spiking. In addition, the signing of a phase one trade accord between the U.S. and China has lifted global sentiment and could encourage firms to press ahead with investment.
The RBA in its quarterly economic update in November forecast unemployment of 5.2% and wage growth of around 2.3% in 2020. It will release updated estimates on Feb. 7.

1415,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 11:56PM ET</span>","Philippine GDP Picks Up in Fourth Quarter, Just Misses 2019 Goal","(Bloomberg) -- The Philippine economy picked up further in the fourth quarter after the government boosted infrastructure spending but fell just short of the government’s target for all of 2019, notching its slowest annual growth since 2011.
Gross domestic product expanded 6.4% in the October to December period, quickening from 6% in the third quarter, the Philippine Statistics Authority said in a briefing in Manila. The showing matched the median forecast among 23 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
The recovery brought economic growth for the full year to 5.9%, just below the government’s revised 6%-6.5% target.
“The subdued pace of recovery, coupled with a higher growth aspiration” -- the government’s GDP target for 2020 is 6.5%-7.5% -- “means that the Philippine economy will likely need a boost from both fiscal and monetary policy,” said Nicholas Mapa, senior economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Manila. “We continue to pencil in a 25 basis-point rate cut at the 6 February meeting given the disappointing growth numbers.”
The Philippines likely grew faster than all other major economies in the region except for Vietnam, Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia told reporters after Thursday’s release. Growth was driven mainly by increased government spending -- up 18.7% in the fourth quarter -- after a delay in passing the budget in the first half of the year, he said.
“Our estimate was a full percentage point was lost with the delay in the passage of the 2019 budget,” Pernia said. “We could have hit close to, if not right smack, 7% GDP growth this year.”
Doubting Easing
Euben Paracuelles, chief Asean economist at Nomura Holdings Ltd. in Singapore, disputed the idea that more easing was in the cards.
“With an economy on a more solid footing, and the fiscal stance turning more highly expansionary, I don’t think it needs more monetary accommodation, not especially when inflation is on the rise with some upside risks, and output gaps are wide,” he said. “My forecast this year is policy rate remaining stable.”
Highlights from Thursday’s release and briefing include:
Consumer spending increased 5.6% in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier periodPublic construction rose 34% in the fourth quarterIndustrial production gained 5.4% in the fourth quarter‘Impressive’ Showing
Spending, particularly for infrastructure projects, has rebounded since the budget approval. That’s expected to continue after the government extended the validity of last year’s spending plan and approved the 2020 budget on time.
“Full-year GDP growth of 5.9%, amidst a slowing global economy, is still impressive. The Philippines is still one of the fastest growing economies in Asia and in the world,” the central bank governor, Benjamin Diokno, said in a texted response to a Bloomberg query. “GDP growth of 7% looks attainable this year.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The outlook for the Philippine economy continued to brighten in 4Q, with a growth pickup setting the stage for a rebound in 2020. A spike in public spending underpinned the acceleration in growth, with a pickup in fixed private investment and firm household consumption also lending support. We expect those trends to persist this year -- with accommodative monetary policy to further bolster the economy.”
Justin Jimenez, Bloomberg Economics
Pernia identified trade tensions, Middle East unrest and weather as key risks to the growth outlook.
Damage from the ongoing eruption of Taal volcano near Manila should be limited to surrounding towns and is not expected to dent overall growth in the first quarter, Pernia said Jan. 15. On Thursday, he estimated the economic impact within the immediate danger zone at 4.3 billion pesos ($84.5 million).

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 10:01PM ET</span>","Australia jobless hits nine-month low, analysts give up on February rate cut","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment outpaced forecasts for a second month in December pushing the jobless rate to a nine-month low, a much-needed improvement that could forestall a near-term cut in interest rates.
The local dollar climbed 0.47% to $0.6874 as the market sharply scaled back the chance of an easing from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) at its policy meeting on Feb. 4.
Analysts at several major banks, including CBA, ANZ and Citi, threw in the towel on a February cut though they still expect a move at some point.
""The final employment report for 2019 was a solid one,"" said Gareth Aird, a senior economist at CBA. ""The labor market continues to defy the activity data.""
""It's too soon to say rate cuts are done, but bottom line, we have removed the February rate cut in our forecasts and pushed it back to April.""
Thursday's data showed 28,900 net new jobs were created in December, beating forecasts of 15,000 and on top of a surprisingly strong 38,400 gain in November.
The unemployment rate edged down a tick to 5.1%, the lowest reading since March last year and again under forecasts.
The breakdown on employment was a little less encouraging, with all the new jobs being part-time and full-time positions actually dipping by 300.
Still, investors wagered the fall in unemployment would weigh against the need for an imminent rate cut. Futures shifted to imply a 20% chance of a quarter-point easing next month, compared with 50% ahead of the jobs data.
A move to 0.5% was still priced at 78% by May, though again that was down from almost 100% before the report.
The RBA has long argued unemployment needs to fall to at least 4.5% to deliver a desperately-needed lift in wage growth, which has been stuck around 2.3% for a year or more.
That was a major reason it cut rates three times last year to a record low of 0.75%, though with only limited success.
The central bank specifically highlighted the risks to unemployment at its December meeting, saying policy would be reviewed in February should the outlook deteriorate.
NATIONAL TRAGEDY
The dip in unemployment will be a relief to the conservative government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, which has drawn widespread criticism for its reaction to bushfires sweeping the country, and charges it was not doing enough to address climate change.
The fires have smothered Sydney and Melbourne in smoke and scared off tourists at the peak of the summer holiday period. It has also darkened the mood of consumers when they were already fretting over stagnant wages and mountains of debt.
Economists estimate the cost to Australia's A$2 trillion ($1.37 trillion) economy could be as high as A$5 billion and perhaps shave 0.25 points off gross domestic product in the December and March quarters.
""The current bushfire season – underway since September – is a national tragedy,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster. ""The economic impact in bushfire-affected areas has been extreme.""
""While it is unlikely that the fires were a major influence on national December retail sales, there may be much more substantial second round impacts in January and February.""
Adding to the woe has been the sudden outbreak of a new type of coronavirus in China, which could curb tourism over Lunar New Year and beyond. Australia is a major holiday destination for the Chinese with 1.4 million trips made annually."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell for a 13th straight month in December, hurt by U.S.-bound shipments of cars, construction and mining machinery, suggesting weak external demand is likely to remain a drag on the trade-reliant economy for a while longer.
The 6.3% year-on-year fall in exports was worse than a 4.2% decrease expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a revised 7.9% year-on-year decline in the previous month, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Thursday.
Analysts and policymakers say a preliminary trade deal agreed between the United States and China last week and progress on Britain's exit from the European Union would help ease worries over global trade, a key driver of Japan's economy.
Yet, the latest data showed only a modest slowing in the pace of contraction and suggests a sure-footed recovery may be months away.
""Exports are likely to bottom out around this spring,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, citing a pick-up in global semiconductor demand.
A rush in shipments ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays may have helped ease the export slowdown last month, he added, suggesting there may be a further contraction in January.
""Shipments are unlikely to serve as a main engine of growth this year due to the economic slowdown in the United States and China,"" Minami said.
Bank of Japan policymakers have argued that solid domestic demand should help offset weak shipments and manufacturing activity.
On Tuesday, the BOJ nudged up its economic growth forecasts and sounded cautiously optimistic about the global outlook, though it said ongoing risks meant it was way too early to consider scaling down its massive stimulus. 
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, grew 0.8% in the year to December, led by demand for chip-making equipment, cars and plastic. It was the first annual increase in 10 months.
Shipments to the United States, the country's No. 2 trading partner, fell 14.9% year-on-year in December - a fifth straight month of falls - dragged down by cars, car parts and airplane motor engines, the MOF data showed.
Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japan's overall shipments, decreased 3.6% in the year to December, it showed.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday the progress in U.S.-China trade talks and Brexit helped ease risk sentiment, but added that uncertainty remains on the trade relations between Washington and Beijing.
""While risks surrounding global growth have subsided somewhat, they remain large,"" he told a news conference, signaling the BOJ's resolve to keep its powerful easing.
The International Monetary Fund on Monday trimmed its 2020 global growth forecasts on sharper-than-expected slowdowns in emerging markets, but said the U.S.-China deal was another sign that manufacturing activity may soon bottom out.

Many economists expect the world's third largest economy to have shrunk in the final quarter of last year as the U.S.-China trade war hit exports and the Oct. 1 sales tax hike weighed on private consumption. A moderate rebound is seen in the current quarter.

Human resources consultancy XpertHR said the slowdown, based on 23 pay deals between October and December, meant that awards in 2019 rose by an average of 2.5%, the same as 2018, and there were similar signs at the start of this year.
""The first pay deals of 2020 suggest that employers are taking a cautious approach, leading us to believe that there will be no jump in pay award levels in 2020,"" XpertHR analyst Sheila Attwood said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales jumped to their highest level in nearly two years in December, the latest indication that lower mortgage rates are helping the housing market to regain its footing after hitting a soft patch in 2018, though record low inventory could be an obstacle to continued strong gains.
The report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday followed on the heels of government data last week showing homebuilding raced to a 13-year high in December. Renewed housing market momentum could soften some of the hit on the economy from manufacturing as the thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions is offset by Boeing's (N:BA) suspension this month of production of its troubled 737 MAX plane.
""The previous weak link, housing, is coming back, but the current laggard, manufacturing, is slowing further,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Existing home sales increased 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million units last month, the highest level since February 2018, boosted by a surge in sales of multi-family housing units and gains in single-family home dwellings. November's sales pace was unrevised at 5.35 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales would increase 1.3% to a rate of 5.43 million units in December. Last month, existing home sales rose in the Northeast, West and the populous South. But sales fell in the Midwest.
Existing home sales, which make up about 90% of U.S. home sales, surged 10.0% on a year-on-year basis in December. For all of 2019, sales were unchanged at 5.34 million units.
The report helped to lift the PHLX housing index (HGX). Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, also cheered by an upbeat forecast from  IBM  (N:IBM) and China's efforts to contain a new flu-like virus outbreak. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
The housing market is being supported by cheaper mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.65% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. 
But the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes, especially in the lower-priced segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages. 
The supply squeeze and resulting reacceleration in house price inflation could slow home sales this year.
According to the NAR, there was a 14% drop from a year earlier in sales of houses priced $100,000 and below. 
""Still, with rising incomes, more households being formed, and low mortgage rates, demand for housing should remain robust to keep home sales activity at an elevated level – although likely little changed from 2019,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. 
LIFT TO GDP
December's increase in existing homes sales likely means more in brokers' commissions, which suggests that housing probably contributed to GDP growth again in the fourth quarter. Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.8% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP next Thursday.
There were a record-low 1.40 million previously owned homes on the market in December, down 14.6% from November and 8.5% from a year ago. As a result, the median existing house price soared 7.8% from a year ago, the most since January 2016, to $274,500 in December. House prices increased 4.8% in 2019.
The NAR report likely exaggerates the pace of house price appreciation because of sampling methodology. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 4.9% in November from a year ago, slowing from an increase of 5.2% in October. 
According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Daniel Silver, the FHFA measure is considered one of the more reliable house price measures ""that control for changes in the mix of sales.""
The NAR report showed that at December's sales pace, it would take a record few 3.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.7 months in November. 
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 41 days, up from 38 days in November, but down from 46 days a year ago. Forty-three percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month. 

First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales last month, slightly down from 32% in November and a year ago. They accounted for 33% of all transactions in 2019.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada maintained its key overnight interest rate at 1.75% as expected on Wednesday but opened the door to a possible cut should a recent slowdown in Canadian economic growth drag on.
The central bank - which has kept rates unchanged since October 2018 - said that while the economy has been resilient, recent economic data has been mixed, and noted ""unexpectedly soft"" indicators of consumer confidence and spending, and weaker business investment.
""We're not saying that the door is not open to an interest rate cut. Obviously it is - it is open,"" Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told a news conference.
""But it hinges on how the data evolve from here because ... we have a strong belief that this will prove temporary, but temporary could be longer or shorter,"" added Poloz, who later noted rates were ""still really low"".
The central bank slashed its forecast for fourth quarter annualized growth to 0.3% from 1.3% in October. It also pegged annualized growth for the first quarter of 2020 at 1.3%, down from a previous internal forecast of 1.7%.
The bank said it would be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth was more persistent than forecast.
Poloz's comments increased the pressure on the Canadian dollar, which had already dropped after the interest rate decision. By 12 p.m. EST (1700 GMT) it was trading at C$1.3140, or 76.10 U.S. cents.
Money markets now see about a 20% chance of a rate cut in March. [BOCWATCH]
The statement marked the second time in a matter of months the bank has mused about easing. Poloz told reporters in October the bank had discussed whether a rate cut was needed to insure against risks to the economy.
""The fact that the Bank of Canada didn't include the word 'appropriate' in its statement says it all,"" said Simon Harvey, FX analyst for Monex Europe and Monex Canada.
""Rates are going to change at some point this year - is what markets have taken out of it,"" he said.
The Canadian economy was no longer operating close to capacity, the bank said, adding it would pay particular attention to developments in consumer spending, the housing market and business investment.
It said real Canadian GDP for 2020 would be 1.6% rather than the 1.7% it predicted in October but raised its 2021 forecast to 2.0% from 1.8%."

1422,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 10:22AM ET</span>","Bank of Canada Holds Rates, Signals Less Confidence in Outlook","(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady at a meeting Wednesday but expressed heightened concern about an economy that has slowed more than expected, suggesting officials are becoming less confident in a year-long holding pattern.
While the Ottawa-based central bank kept its policy rate unchanged at 1.75% for a 10th-straight decision, it acknowledged the domestic weakness at the end of last year is already spilling over into 2020, and could even persist. They also raised estimates of slack in the economy and dropped language about the current rate being appropriate.
The comments are a departure from recent communications in which officials sought to accentuate the positives of an economy they said was resilient in the face of global uncertainty. While Wednesday’s decision still leaves the Bank of Canada with the highest policy rate among major advanced economies, markets may interpret the statement as an attempt to at the very least open the door for a future move.
“In determining the future path for the Bank’s policy interest rate, Governing Council will be watching closely to see if the recent slowdown in growth is more persistent than forecast,” policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz said in the statement. “In assessing incoming data, the Bank will be paying particular attention to developments in consumer spending, the housing market, and business investment.”
The change in tone since the Bank of Canada last released quarterly forecasts in October reflects a shift in growth risks over that time, from global to domestic. While the central bank three months ago was highlighting the nation’s resiliency to elevated international risks, since then domestic economic concerns have come to the forefront.
Policy makers revised near-term growth projections to reflect the disappointing data. They expressed concern global weakness may be spreading to households, affecting domestic spending more than thought.
The central bank also seems to be entertaining the idea that underlying factors may be behind the slowdown, rather than temporary factors.
“During the past year Canadians have been saving a larger share of their incomes, which could signal increased consumer caution,” the bank said.
The bank revised their growth estimates not just for the fourth-quarter as expected but also for the first-quarter of 2020. It projected fourth-quarter annualized growth in 2019 of 0.3% and 1.3% in the first quarter of 2020. They cited lower exports, weakening business investment, slowing job creation and soft consumer confidence and spending.
While noting there were special factors like strikes, poor weather and inventory adjustments playing a role, the central bank also acknowledged that the weaker data could be a result of a bigger spillover into Canada than previously thought from global weakness and other factors that are making consumers more cautious.
The central bank also said that despite signs of stabilization in the global economy, there remains a “high degree of uncertainty and geopolitical tensions have re-emerged.” While the Canadian economy remains resilient, they said indicators since October have been “mixed.’
Excess Capacity
The near-term slowdown coupled with a slight upward revision to potential growth prompted the central bank to increase its estimate for the amount of slack in the economy -- from about 0.25% of output in the third quarter to about 0.75%.
Long-term estimates were mostly unchanged from October, with a slightly lower growth forecast in 2020 of 1.6%, but 2021 faster than previously forecast at 2%.
This suggests the base case scenario at the bank remains that the slowdown that began in the second half of last year will be temporary. Still, given the worse near-term outlook, the forecasts also suggest policy makers expect the economy won’t be in a position to start eliminating slack until the end of this year.
The Bank of Canada anticipates that over the next two years household spending will pick up, helped in part by a recent tax cut, as will exports and business investment. It also anticipates inflation will stay around the 2% target over the projection horizon.
“While the output gap has widened in recent months, measures of inflation remain around 2%,” the bank said. “This is consistent with an economy that, until recently, has been operating close to capacity.”"

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate held steady at 2.2% in December, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday, supported by higher energy prices and balanced out by slower cost gains in food and cars.
The number is in line with a Reuters analysts' poll. Energy prices were 5.5% higher in December compared with the same month last year, and were up 1.5% over the previous month.
Wednesday's data comes the same day the Bank of Canada is due to announce its next overnight rate decision, which it has held steady since October 2018 even as several of its international counterparts have eased.
Money markets expect the central bank to hold rates unchanged again on Wednesday. The central bank aims to keep inflation at 2%. [BOCWATCH]
""The key point is both headline and core inflation are for all intents and purposes at the Bank of Canada's target,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal.
The Canadian dollar pared gains, touching 1.3047 to the U.S. dollar after the data were released.
CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was at 2.0%, while CPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, was at 2.2%. CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, was at 2.1%.
""We are getting less core inflation pressure than had been expected and I think we'll see more of that as the rest of the year unfolds,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. 
In 2019, consumer inflation averaged 1.9%, down from 2.3% in 2018, Statscan said. 
Higher mortgage interest costs led inflation in 2019, gaining 7.6%, while gasoline prices helped offset that by declining 6.1%. Fresh vegetable prices jumped 12.7% last year, Statscan said.
Statscan also released new home prices for December, which gained 0.2% in December, led by those in Ottawa. Prices in Toronto were up by 0.2%, while in Vancouver they rose 0.4%. 
Separately, Statscan said Canadian wholesale trade fell for the third time in five months in November, declining 1.2% as sales of motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts and accessories dropped. 

Statscan said wholesale inventories increased by 0.4% while sales volumes declined by 0.9%.

The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly gauge of manufacturing optimism rose to +23 in January from -44 in October, its highest level since April 2014.
Still, gauges of output improved only slightly, adding to questions about whether a jump in optimism since Prime Minister Boris Johnson's landslide election win last month will translate into stronger economic activity.
That is the dilemma that faces BoE policymakers who next week will decide whether to cut interest rates.
British government bond prices fell on the data and money markets showed only a 50% chance that the BoE will cut interest rates next Thursday, down from around 65% before the data.
""The results confirm other survey and anecdotal evidence pointing to economic growth stepping up a gear since December’s election,"" Philip Shaw, chief economist of Investec, said.
The CBI noted that output and orders were still declining.
The vast majority of economists polled by Reuters - 60 out of 68 - do not think the BoE will cut interest rates next week and will instead wait to see how the improvement in optimism pans out for the economy more broadly in the next few months. [ECILT/GB]
""If we are to build on this rebound in optimism among UK manufacturers, it is crucial for the UK and EU to establish a trade deal that supports growth in this sector,"" CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said.

1426,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 05:28AM ET</span>",U.K. Government Spending Soars as Austerity Continues to Thaw,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid presided over the continued easing of austerity last month as departmental spending rose at its fastest pace for any December since 2003.
The 10.5% increase from a year earlier came as the government pumped money into pay rises in the state-run National Health Service. It rose 5% in the first nine months of the fiscal year, the most for the period since records began in 1997.
The boost left borrowing between April and December at 54.6 billion pounds ($71.3 billion), up 8% from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. The deficit in December alone narrowed slightly to 4.8 billion pounds, thanks to solid revenue growth and a fall in net investment.
The pound was little changed after the data were published and was trading at $1.3057 as of 9:35 a.m. in London.
Britain is loosening the purse strings after almost a decade of budget cutting that has brought down the deficit to under 2% of economic output from 10% in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
The thaw began in 2018 when Theresa May, facing a public backlash, announced a long-term settlement for the NHS. The process has gathered pace under Javid, who pledged the biggest increase in day-to-day spending in 15 years ahead of the general election. A further boost will come in the March 11 budget, though the focus will be spending on investment rather than current spending or big tax reductions.
New fiscal rules allow Javid to borrow an extra 20 billion pounds or so a year for capital spending, funded by ultra-low interest rates, but limit his room for maneuver elsewhere.
The current budget, which excludes investment, is meant to be in balance in three years under the rules and Javid is now on course to meet that target by thinnest of margins.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson led the Conservatives to an emphatic election victory and the budget will almost certainly deliver on his promise of a modest tax cut for most workers.
Javid wants to boost investment in areas such as broadband and transport to boost productivity and shore up the economy as Britain prepares to leave the European Union on Jan. 31. Much of it may go poorer parts of northern and central England, where pro-Brexit voters abandoned Labour for the Conservatives."

Industrial output grew by 3.8% year on year in December, well below the 6.1% forecast in a Reuters poll but higher than November's rise of 1.4%.
""The growth rate of industrial production in the coming months will depend on domestic and foreign demand, but also atmospheric conditions will be significant,"" said Monika Kurtek, chief economist at Bank Pocztowy.
The surprise reading comes against a backdrop of a prolonged slowdown in Polish factory activity, with the IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing showing the sector enduring one of the longest downturns in the survey's history.
According to Kurtek, the reading would be neutral for Polish rate-setters, who mainly watch inflation. Polish CPI hit its highest point since 2012 in December.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 04:41AM ET</span>","UK government borrows less than expected in December, but corporate tax take weakens","LONDON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Britain's government borrowed less than expected in December but there were signs the economy's weakness was hurting corporate tax receipts, while a pay rise for health workers pushed up spending.
Borrowing excluding public sector-owned banks in December alone fell slightly compared with a year earlier to 4.765 billion pounds, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to borrowing of 5.3 billion pounds.
Despite the better-than-expected figure for December, borrowing in the first nine months of the financial year stood at 54.6 billion pounds, 7.9% higher than it was for April-December 2018.
The data showed corporate tax receipts for the financial year to date, April to December, were 3.4% lower than at the same point a year ago, the sharpest annual drop since the same period of the 2012/13 financial year.
On the expenditure side, other current spending was up 5.0% in the financial year to date compared with the same period in 2018/19, a record increase that reflects a pay rise for health workers authorized by former prime minister Theresa May.
After nearly a decade of austerity when the budget deficit fell from 10% of national income to under 2%, Britain's Conservative government began last year to loosen the purse-strings, spending more on health care and public-sector pay.
Finance minister Sajid Javid has announced the biggest increase in day-to-day spending in 15 years for the next financial year and has promised to use public investment to help voters in under-performing regions who gave Prime Minister Boris Johnson a thumping election win last month.
Javid will deliver Britain's first post-Brexit budget plan on March 11.
Despite his promises of more funding, especially for infrastructure, Javid has set himself a rule of eliminating the deficit in day-to-day spending within three years which will restrict how much more he can spend on public services.
The ONS said public-sector net debt totaled 80.8% of GDP in December, excluding public-sector banks, or 73.0% once the effect of a temporary Bank of England lending scheme was stripped out."
1429,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 11:19PM ET</span>",South Korea’s Economy Ends Bad Year With Unexpected Growth Spurt,"(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here to receive the Davos Diary, a special daily newsletter that will run from Jan. 20-24.
South Korea’s economy finished its slowest year of growth since the global financial crisis with a spurt that suggests the worst may be over for the Asian bellwether of global tech trade.
Gross domestic product expanded in the fourth quarter at its fastest pace since 2017, the Bank of Korea said Wednesday. The stronger-than-expected growth was fueled by an aggressive spending push by President Moon Jae-in’s government and a jump in factory investment that included spending on equipment for making semiconductors.
While government spending has been a critical prop for the Korean economy during 2019, the improved facilities investment adds to other signs out of South Korea that a tech industry slump may be bottoming, a potential positive sign for Korean and global growth this year.
Korea’s economy grew 1.2% from the previous three months in the final quarter, almost twice as fast as economists’ forecasts for 0.7%. On an annual basis the economy expanded 2%, for its weakest growth since 2009.
“Overall it’s looking up after bottoming out,” said Park Sang-hyun, an economist for HI Investment & Securities.
The KOSPI index rose after the report, gaining 0.3%, while other regional equities benchmarks dropped on concern over the spread of a deadly flu virus from China.
Government Prop
The quarterly growth was helped by an extra government budget approved in summer to help counter a prolonged export slump that has hit the economy hard. President Moon’s economic policy, which includes a drive to raise the minimum wage, is intended to stoke domestic demand and wean the economy off its dependency on trade.
“I believe government finance played a substantial role last year,” said Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki, acknowledging the administration’s support for the economy. “Government finance should play a complementary role when the private sector is in trouble.”
The Bank of Korea has also played its part, cutting rates twice in the second half of the year to support growth.
While the economy was in desperate need of public spending and rate cuts in 2019, the government may be able to pull back its support in 2020 if the tech sector and global demand pick up sufficiently. The central bank looks set to hold back on further rate cuts for the time being.
“The government helped keep the numbers on track while exports were struggling,” An Ki-tae, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities. “Now it may step back a little for a couple of quarters to watch how other indicators do.”
Chip Hopes
Recent data offer signs of improvement. Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co., the country’s biggest company and one of the world’s top suppliers of semiconductors, this month beat earnings forecasts. Preliminary export data for the first part of January shows chip exports on track for the first monthly gain in more than a year.
BOK Governor Lee Ju-Yeol last week also struck a more optimistic tone as the board voted to keep interest rates on hold. Lee said the economy would grow faster this year than in 2019 as he pointed to easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and a looming recovery in chip exports.
Investment in chip-making equipment and other facilities rose 1.5% last quarter, while construction outlays jumped 6.3%, according to the growth report. Government spending increased 2.6%.
“Given the latest numbers came largely from government spending, it’s a bit hard to embrace them completely as positive,” said An Young-jin, an economist at SK Securities. “Still, a greater government role is a global trend, with improving outlooks for major economies owing much to fiscal policy.”
What Bloomberg’s Economist Says
“Looking ahead, we forecast GDP growth of 2.3% in 2020, reflecting a gradual recovery in exports and investment. On the policy front, an expansionary fiscal stance will likely take the lead in supporting the economy. Our baseline expectation is for the Bank of Korea to stand pat in the year ahead.”

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 08:06PM ET</span>",Australian consumer gloom worsens amid devastating bushfires,"By Swati Pandey
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian consumer pessimism deepened in January as households fretted about the economic impact of devastating bushfires that killed 29 people, millions of animals and destroyed thousands of homes in recent months.
The Melbourne Institute and Westpac Bank (AX:WBC) index of consumer sentiment, released on Wednesday, fell 1.8% in January to the lowest since last October. It declined 1.9% in December.
The index was down a hefty 6.2% from a year earlier, and at 93.4 indicated pessimists continued to outnumber optimists.
The free-fall in sentiment bodes poorly for consumer spending and could hit growth in Australia's A$1.9 trillion ($1.30 trillion) economy in coming quarters.
Economists generally expect the bushfires to drag on gross domestic product by 0.25%-0.4% per quarter through March 2020, with agriculture, retail, tourism and construction the hardest hit.
Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the index could have fallen further but the survey was conducted in the week where there was widespread rain, which somewhat cushioned the hit from the bushfires.
Wildfires are common in Australia but the current season was unprecedented in its scale of destruction and duration. Scores of fires continue to burn on the east coast despite recent rain.
""If the survey had been conducted a few weeks earlier then the index is likely to have fallen by even more, notwithstanding the very low starting point,"" Evans said in a statement.
""This low level of confidence is consistent with the generally lackluster reports on consumer spending.""
All the economic components of the index recorded declines in January.
The ""economy, next five years"" sub-index fell 3.7% in while the ""economy, next 12 months"" sub-index slipped 5.4%. Both are down 8.9% and 11.9% respectively.
The direct impact of the fires has so far been felt mainly in rural townships though hazardous smoke haze hung over the biggest cities of Sydney and Melbourne, hitting tourism and spending.
Businesses are also feeling the heat with fashion retailers and food & beverage makers reporting a slowdown in sales.
The Australian Tourism Export Council has estimated international tourism revenue in 2020 could fall by 10% to 20%.
""Overall, we think that the bushfires increase the likelihood of a rate cut from the RBA in February,"" UBS analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) slashed interest rates three times last year to an all-time low of 0.75% and has expressed intentions to do more if needed."

BERLIN (Reuters) - A truce in the U.S.-China trade dispute has left German investors at their most optimistic since mid-2015, a leading survey showed, but its compiler cautioned that the growth outlook for Europe's dominant economy remains subdued.
Economic sentiment among investors rose to 26.7 in January from 10.7 in December, according to Tuesday's ZEW research institute survey - its highest reading since July 2015 and well above a forecast of 15.0.
ZEW President Achim Wambach said the better mood was mainly due to last week's Phase 1 trade agreement between Washington and Beijing. Their 18-month conflict had dampened global growth and increased business uncertainty.
""This gives rise to the hope that the trade dispute's negative effects on the German economy will be less pronounced than previously thought,"" Wambach said.
The United States and China are among Germany's most important export markets.
But while the outlook for the historically export-focused economy had improved, growth was still expected to remain below its long-term average, Wambach said, and trade experts expressed doubt that the Sino-U.S. deal would automatically benefit Germany and the wider euro zone.
(GRAPHIC: ZEW index jumps in January: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1322/1308/ZEW.png) 
German growth slowed last year to 0.6%, its weakest since 2013, as export-dependent manufacturers were hit by lower foreign demand and trade conflicts triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Germany's BDI industry association has said there are no signs of improvement in manufacturing and it expects overall German growth to slow further this year.
A separate ZEW gauge measuring investors' assessment of current economic conditions improved to -9.5 from -19.9. Analysts had forecast -13.5.
Daniela Ordonez, an analyst with Oxford Economics, said the big picture in the euro zone remained one of weak growth ahead. ""The manufacturing recovery will be capped by timid global trade and a still high level of uncertainty, while fiscal policy support will remain insufficient,"" she said.

Gabriel Felbermayr, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, forecast the Phase 1 trade deal would redirect global trade flows and cut demand for European goods worth nearly $11 billion, with Germany likely to be hurt most.

Investor confidence in Germany’s growth outlook rose to the highest in more than four years years after easing trade tensions bolstered prospects for the country’s ailing manufacturers.
ZEW’s index of expectations for the next six months increased to 26.7 in January, exceeding all estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The gauge turned positive last month for the first time since April, meaning more respondents are optimistic about the future than pessimistic.
The euro rose to an intra-day high after the report and traded at $1.1096 at 11:05 a.m. Frankfurt time.
The surge in sentiment follows a report by the Bundesbank on Monday indicating manufacturing could bottom out at the start of the year. The U.S. and China signed a preliminary trade deal last week.
“This gives rise to the hope that the trade dispute’s negative effects on the German economy will be less pronounced than previously thought,” ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. “The German economy developed slightly better than expected in the previous year. Although the outlook has improved, growth is still expected to remain below average.”
The European Central Bank will meet this week to discuss monetary policy, and President Christine Lagarde is expected to launch a year-long review of its strategy. A number of officials including French Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Executive Board member Yves Mersch have pointed to signs the euro-area economy may be stabilizing.
They also said it was too early to sound the all-clear for the 19-nation region. That means the ECB is set to stick to its current policy of negative interest rates and quantitative easing until inflation of just under 2% is firmly within reach."

LONDON (Reuters) - British job growth was the strongest in nearly a year in the three months to November, according to data that could weaken the case for an interest rate cut by the Bank of England next week.
Signs of weakness in job creation prompted two BoE rate-setters to vote for lower borrowing costs at the end of last year. Three others, including Governor Mark Carney, have said recently that more economic stimulus might be needed.
The BoE is due to announce its next rates decision on Jan. 30.
Tuesday's reading showed the number of people in employment rose by 208,000 to 32.90 million, the biggest increase since the three months to January 2019 and much stronger than the median forecast in a Reuters poll for a rise of 110,000.
Sterling rose and British government bond prices fell after the data. 
Thomas Pugh, an economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee was giving more weight than usual to the labor market to help it determine the state of the economy. 
""As such, the rebound in employment and slightly softer pay growth will give the MPC another reason not to cut rates from 0.75% to 0.50% at their next meeting,"" he said.
The Office for National Statistics said the strong jobs growth reflected a particularly weak three-month period to August when jobs fell, but the data also showed the employment rate hit a record high of 76.3% and jobs growth was driven by hiring as well as self-employment.
The number of people out of work dropped by 7,000 to 1.31 million and the unemployment rate of 3.8% remained at its lowest level since early 1975.
The data represented a snapshot of Britain's economy before the Dec. 12 national election won emphatically by Boris Johnson. Since then there have been some signs of an improvement in consumer and business confidence. 
Investors are waiting for Friday's preliminary IHS Markit PMI surveys of businesses in January for a more comprehensive assessment of any change in the economy since the election.
The ONS said total earnings growth, including bonuses, rose by an annual 3.2%, the same pace as in the three months to October which was the slowest since September 2018.
Excluding bonuses, which smooth out some volatility, pay growth slowed a touch to 3.4%, the slowest since the three months to April 2019. 
Economists had expected total pay to grow by 3.1% and regular pay to grow by 3.4%. 
""While pay growth has eased since last summer, with inflation remaining subdued, earnings are continuing to increase in real terms,"" ONS statistician David Freeman said.
Vacancies rose in the three months to December to 805,000 from 798,000 which was their lowest level since mid-2017.
Britain's economy grew at its slowest annual pace in more than seven years in November, ONS data showed last week.

Many employers remain worried that uncertainty will continue this year because Prime Minister Johnson has ruled out extending a Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020, saying he will clinch a trade deal with the European Union by then.

The euro zone has been struggling with sluggish growth for two years as a global trade war and a slowdown in China hurt its exports, offsetting stronger domestic demand in some countries.
This is now starting to show in companies' decisions to cut down on investment and credit - a trend that banks now expect to continue, the ECB said in its quarterly Bank Lending Survey.
""Net demand for loans to enterprises declined in the fourth quarter of 2019 ... the first time this had been seen since the fourth quarter of 2013, whereas banks had expected it to remain stable overall,"" the ECB said. 
""That decline in net demand was broadly based across a number of larger and smaller euro area countries,"" it added.
Demand for mortgages continued to rise, however, particularly in France, Italy and Germany - likely strengthening concerns that the ECB's ultra-easy policy is fuelling housing bubbles in some countries. 
Spain stood out as the only large country where demand for all credit categories - company loans, mortgages and consumer debt - fell and banks tightened access to loans across the board. 
The ECB cut its deposit rate farther into negative territory in September, offered multi-year loans to banks at even easier terms and restarted adding to its 2.6 trillion euro ($2.9 trillion) bond portfolio in a bid to shore up price growth.

It is expected to stand by these decisions at a policy meeting on Thursday, when new President Christine Lagarde will also launch a review of the ECB's strategy that may see it change its inflation target and how it pursues it.

Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2014-2018 has been raised to 7.4%, 7.0%, 6.8%, 6.9% and 6.7% from 7.3%, 6.9%, 6.7%, 6.8% and 6.6% previously, the latest data from the statistical bureau showed on Saturday.
Based on the revised figures, real GDP growth of at least 5.6% in 2020 would be enough for achieving Beijing's target to double GDP in the decade to 2020, according to Reuters calculations, in line with analysts' estimates.
""We believe this revision provides Beijing with some flexibility in setting its 2020 growth target and precludes the need to introduce another round of massive stimulus that could rapidly increase systemic risks,"" said Nomura analysts in a note on Monday.
Policy sources have told Reuters that Beijing plans to set a lower growth target of around 6% this year from last year's 6-6.5%, relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown. Key targets are due to be announced in March.
China's economic growth cooled to 6.1% in 2019, its weakest in nearly 30 years amid a bruising trade war with the United States, and more stimulus is expected this year as Beijing tries to boost sluggish investment and demand.
Many China observers generally see this year as crucial for the ruling Communist Party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product (GDP) and incomes in the decade to 2020, and turning China into a ""moderately prosperous"" nation."

The rate stood unchanged at 5.4% in 2019, or 188 million people, and is expected to remain there in 2020 and rise to 5.5% in 2021, the ILO said in its annual report.
""This means that the gradual decline of the unemployment rate observed between 2009 and 2018 appears to have come to a halt,"" it said, citing a world economic slowdown, especially in manufacturing.
Even for those with jobs, it is becoming harder for many to live better lives, or exit poverty, a trend Director-General Guy Ryder described as ""extremely worrying"" with ""very profound and worrying implications for social cohesion"".
""Persisting and substantial work-related inequalities and exclusion have prevented them (millions of people) from finding decent work and better futures,"" Ryder told journalists.
The ILO said that about 470 million people in total have insufficient paid work, a new data set which includes not only the unemployed but also the under-employed and those lacking access to the labor market.
The report noted the difficulties faced by young people in getting jobs, with 22% of those aged 15-24 not in employment, education or training.
It also noted the rate of female participation in the workforce remained at just 47%, 27 percentage points below the male rate. ""We are not going where we want to go,"" said Ryder, referring to a commitment by G20 leaders in 2014 to reduce the gender gap in the workforce.
The global working poverty is declining, the report said, but that masked limited progress in low-income countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, the report said."

LONDON (Reuters) - British households grew more confident about their finances and a measure of house prices rose by a record amount for January, according to surveys which added to other signs of a brightening mood in the economy since last month's election.
Ten days before the Bank of England decides whether to cut interest rates, the surveys published on Monday suggested that some of the uncertainty that has weighed on the economy has lifted after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's big election win.
IHS Markit, a data firm, said its Household Finance Index rose to a one-year high of 44.6 in January from 43.2 in December, chiming with other sentiment surveys from both businesses and consumers that have shown an increase in optimism.
Earlier on Monday, property website Rightmove said asking prices for houses increased in January at a record pace for the month, up 2.3% compared with December.
Still, BoE officials are likely to want to see whether the cheerier mood has translated into actual spending as they weigh up whether to cut rates on Jan. 30.
""What data there has been released capturing the post-election period suggests that the outcome has had a positive effect on consumer and business sentiment,"" analysts at RBC said in a research note.
""Our view remains that a majority of (BoE officials) will prefer to wait for evidence of how the economy is responding to the outcome of December's election and the removal of near-term Brexit uncertainty before deciding on a policy move.""
Money markets currently price in a roughly 65% chance that the BoE will cut interest rates on Jan. 30, although economists in a Reuters poll of economists published last week are more skeptical. Sixty out of 68 forecast no change to rates.
Investors will be watching Friday's ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' indexes carefully for an early indication of the economy's health this month.
Retail sales data last Friday showed an unexpected drop in December and investors will be eyeing Tuesday's official labor market data for November carefully.
""Latest survey data certainly show some post-election bounce for UK households, with the headline index up to a one-year high and house price expectations at their strongest since October 2018,"" Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
Weakening inflation had helped to ease pressure on living costs, the survey showed.
However, a separate index measuring households' expectations of future financial wellbeing slid back into negative territory in January, as gauges of perceptions of workplace activity and income weakened.
The proportion of households expecting a BoE rate cut ""at some time"" increased to 23.1%, while those expecting a rate hike in the next three months went down slightly to 19.5%, IHS Markit said."
1438,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 05:06AM ET</span>",U.K. House Prices Post Record January Jump After Election,"(Bloomberg) -- Asking prices for U.K. homes increased by the most for any January on record in a sign that the Conservatives’ December election win boosted confidence, according to property website-operator Rightmove.
Values increased 2.3% on the month to an average 306,810 pounds ($400,000) Rightmove said in a report Monday. In London, they gained 2.1% from a month earlier, a departure from the years of Brexit-related uncertainty that disproportionately affected prices in the capital. Both upswings were the largest for the time of year since the house-price index started in 2002.
“There now seems to be a release of this pent-up demand,” said Rightmove Director Miles Shipside. “While there may well be more twists and turns to come in the Brexit saga, there is now an opportunity for sellers to get their property on the market for a spring move unaffected by Brexit deadlines.”
Homebuilders including  Persimmon  (LON:PSN) Plc,  Barratt Developments  (LON:BDEV) Plc and Berkeley Group Holdings Plc were among the top gainers in the FTSE 100 index on Monday.
Following the election there was a 15% increase in buyer inquiries compared to a year earlier, Rightmove said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s decisive victory in December provides some clarity on the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union, though there are still significant questions about the longer-term outlook. Experts are skeptical that a new free-trade agreement can be struck in the short period Johnson has set out. He’s ruled out any extension to the Brexit transition phase, due to finish at the end of 2020, meaning negotiators will have just 11 months to come to an agreement.

Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2014-2018 has been raised to 7.4%, 7.0%, 6.8%, 6.9% and 6.7% from 7.3%, 6.9%, 6.7%, 6.8% and 6.6% previously, the latest data from the statistical bureau showed on Saturday.
Based on the revised figures, real GDP growth of at least 5.6% in 2020 would be enough for achieving Beijing's target to double GDP in the decade to 2020, according to Reuters calculations, in line with analysts' estimates.
""We believe this revision provides Beijing with some flexibility in setting its 2020 growth target and precludes the need to introduce another round of massive stimulus that could rapidly increase systemic risks,"" said Nomura analysts in a note on Monday.
Policy sources have told Reuters that Beijing plans to set a lower growth target of around 6% this year from last year's 6-6.5%, relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown. Key targets are due to be announced in March.
China's economic growth cooled to 6.1% in 2019, its weakest in nearly 30 years amid a bruising trade war with the United States, and more stimulus is expected this year as Beijing tries to boost sluggish investment and demand.
Many China observers generally see this year as crucial for the ruling Communist Party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product (GDP) and incomes in the decade to 2020, and turning China into a ""moderately prosperous"" nation."
1440,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 12:22PM ET</span>","U.S. housing starts at 13-year high, factory output gains","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding surged to a 13-year high in December as activity increased across the board, suggesting the housing market recovery was back on track amid low mortgage rates, and could help support the longest economic expansion on record.
There was also some encouraging news on manufacturing, with other data on Friday showing production at factories increasing for a second straight month in December, indicating some stabilization in one of the industries hardest hit by the Trump administration's 18-month trade war with China.
Though U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed a ""Phase 1"" trade deal on Wednesday, a first step toward defusing the trade war, manufacturing is not out of the woods yet. Boeing (N:BA) this month suspended production of its fast-selling 737 MAX jetliner and ripple effects of that decision are already being felt, with a major supplier announcing layoffs last week.
""The shockingly large rise in home construction is likely to provide an unexpected boost to growth,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""However, the first quarter of 2020 it might be a lot softer.""
Housing starts jumped 16.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.608 million units last month, the highest level since December 2006. The percentage gain was the largest since October 2016. Groundbreaking activity last month was likely flattered by unseasonably mild weather and probably overstates the health of the housing market.
Data for November was revised higher to show homebuilding rising to a pace of 1.375 million units, instead of advancing to a rate of 1.365 million units as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts would increase to a pace of 1.375 million units in December.
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the main indexes hitting record highs.
Housing starts soared 40.8% on a year-on-year basis in December. An estimated 1.290 million housing units were started in 2019, up 3.2% compared to 2018.
The rise in construction, together with an increase in completions and the inventory of homes under construction, could ease a housing shortage that has constrained sales over the last couple of years. Housing completions increased 5.1% to a rate of 1.277 million units in December.
SUPPLY SQUEEZE
Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction rose 2.0% to 1.192 million units, the highest level since March 2007.
""It's going to take more than increased construction to completely emerge from the ongoing and historic inventory shortage, but more home building certainly won't hurt,"" said Matthew Speakman, economist at online real estate firm Zillow. ""For now, it appears that builders are game for the challenge.""
The housing market is regaining momentum after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year, pushing down mortgage rates from last year's multi-year highs. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.65% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Though a survey on Monday showed confidence among homebuilders dipped in January, it remained near levels last seen in mid-1999. Builders said they ""continue to grapple with a shortage of lots and labor while buyers are frustrated by a lack of inventory, particularly among starter homes.""
While the housing market accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, it has a bigger footprint on the economy, which is now in its 11th year of expansion, through industries such as utilities, retail and manufacturing.
In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said manufacturing production rose 0.2% last month, adding to November's 1.0% increase. Manufacturing output, however, fell 1.0% in the fourth quarter. It dropped 0.2% in 2019, the first decline since 2016.
The U.S.-China trade war has eroded business confidence, leading to a decline in capital expenditures. The housing market improvement is offsetting some of the drag on the economy from weak manufacturing.
Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. It is expected to contribute to gross domestic product again in the fourth quarter.
Groundbreaking activity could, however, slow in the coming months as building fell 3.9% to a rate of 1.416 million units in December after hitting the highest level in more than 12-1/2 years in November. An estimated 1.369 million building permits were authorized in 2019.
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, jumped 11.2% to a rate of 1.055 units in December, the highest level since June 2007. Single-family housing starts rose in the Midwest and the populous South. They fell, however, in the Northeast and West.
Single-family housing building permits slipped 0.5% to a rate of 916,000 units in December after rising for seven straight months.
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment vaulted 29.8% to a rate of 553,000 units last month. Starts for buildings with five units or more were the highest since July 1986. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes fell 9.6% to a rate of 500,000 units."

(Bloomberg) -- The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index for January edged down to 99.1 from a seven-month high of 99.3 in December, data showed Friday. The gauge of current conditions increased slightly to 115.8 while the expectations index ticked down to 88.3.
Key Insights

Relatively strong sentiment signals consumers are positioned to help driving the record-long economic expansion even as business investment remains sluggish. At the same time, it's the first decline since August, suggesting growth will remain moderate at the start of 2020 after cooling at the end of last year.
The measure of Americans' expectations for inflation five to 10 years out rose to 2.5% from a record-low 2.2%. The Federal Reserve closely monitors this measure, and policy makers have signaled they will hold interest rates steady following last year's three cuts in part to keep price gains rising toward their 2% goal.
Other reports this week showed retail sales excluding autos climbed in December by the most in five months, while housing starts surged to a 13-year high. A trade truce between the U.S. and China may support sentiment following an escalating tariff battle over the past two years that has at times whipsawed confidence.
The Michigan data compare with a 19-year high in the weekly Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index. The Conference Board’s confidence gauge fell in December for the fourth time in five months, though is still elevated by historical standards.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 09:29AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing output rises unexpectedly,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output rose unexpectedly in December as a drop in motor vehicle output was outpaced by increases in production of other durable goods, food and beverages, and other products.
The Federal Reserve said on Friday that manufacturing production rose 0.2% last month after a downwardly revised 1.0% increase in November. Overall industrial output fell 0.3% in December after a downwardly revised increase of 0.8% in November.
The drop in overall industrial output was driven by a 5.6% decline among utilities, as demand for heating fell during an unseasonably warm December.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts, industrial production in December was unchanged, and manufacturing rose 0.5%.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast both overall industrial output and manufacturing output would fall 0.2% in December. On an annualized basis production at factories fell 1.3% from December 2018 to December 2019.
The Fed's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
There was a 4.6% fall in the production of motor vehicles and parts in December. Manufacturing output of food, beverage and tobacco products rose 1.3%, nonmetallic mineral products rose 2.3%, primary metals output rose 1.3%, and computer and electronics products rose 1.4%.
The manufacturing sector, which makes up about 11% of the U.S. economy, has been weakened by a 18-month-long trade war between the United States and China. The two countries signed a preliminary trade deal on Wednesday.
With overall industrial output falling, capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, fell 0.4 percentage point to 77% in December from an upwardly revised 77.4% in November.
However that was influenced by the decline in utilities output. Utilization at factories nudged higher, to 75.2% compared to 75.1% in November."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany imported 40.2 million tonnes of hard coal last year, 14.7% less than in 2018 due to competition from renewables and gas, and as the steel industry curbed usage, importers said on Friday.
The total was comprised of an estimated 7.4% lower intake of coking coal for steelmakers, who purchased 11.5 million tonnes and a 15.5% fall in purchases of coke, a related product, of 1.9 million tonnes, lobby group VDKI said at its annual meeting.
Thirdly and most significantly, purchases by coal-to-power generators, the biggest user group, fell 17.4% to 26.8 million.
""Coal is being pushed out not only by renewable energy, there is an additional price competition with natural gas while carbon emissions permit prices are rising,"" said the group's managing director, Franz-Josef Wodopia.
Emissions allowances are a mandatory input for power generators.
Their prices have increased strongly amid political moves to tighten supply, in order to raise prices and incentivize the avoidance of more CO2 pollution.
Coal consumption was also hit because of the ongoing expansion of wind and solar power plants in the green energy transition, which are driven by the weather and whose output volumes are given priority on transmission grids.
VDKI did not give an import forecast for 2020.
Policymakers on Thursday finalised details of a long-term exit plan from burning domestically mined brown coal up to 2038 due to be passed by the cabinet by the end of this month.
VDKI criticized planned stipulations relating to phasing out sizeable hard coal capacity by 2026 and more still by 2030 and finally 2038. Known since last year, the plans may or may not be passed along with those for lignite.
It said the potential of emissions savings achieved this way could be outweighed by coal operators elsewhere in Europe producing more, while energy prices in Germany would go up.
As for the trend of coal's demise, other industry data have recently mirrored those described by VDKI.
Within Germany's primary energy mix, hard coal use last year fell 20.5% year-on-year to a historic low and brown coal use fell 20.7%, industry statistics body AGEB has said.
The primary energy mix, beyond power generation, describes usage of all fuels for use in transport, heating and industries, including nuclear energy, as well as mineral oil and products.
Coal burning's share in Germany's electricity production dropped by 9 percentage points last year to 29%, the Fraunhofer research service said.
VDKI separately commented on world coal trade."

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers failed to increase their spending for a record fifth month in a row in December, adding to signs of economic weakening that might prompt the Bank of England to cut interest rates this month.
Official data on Friday showed sales volumes fell by 0.6% from November, defying the median forecast for a rise of 0.5% in a Reuters poll of economists.
Sales in monthly terms have not risen since July, the longest such run since records began in 1996, the Office for National Statistics said, adding that food sales fell by the most in three years.
Sterling weakened and British government bond prices rose as investors increasingly bet on the Bank of England cutting rates on Jan. 30, at the end of its next meeting.
Two of its nine policymakers voted in November and December for a cut and three others, including Governor Mark Carney, have said lower borrowing costs might be needed soon.
Friday's figures are the first hard data that suggest a bounce in consumer sentiment since Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson's landslide election win on Dec. 12 might not have fed through into actual spending.
""December's outright fall in retail sales, despite a potential boost from the lateness of Black Friday, does not bode well for GDP growth in December and could nudge the Monetary Policy Committee closer still to cutting rates at the end of the month,"" said Thomas Pugh, an economist at Capital Economics.
""But the election and the removal of some uncertainty could represent a turning point for the economy. Indeed, there are signs that sentiment has already turned up. As a result, January might not be quite as bad.""
Allan Monks, a JP Morgan economist, said the weak picture of the economy in late 2019 meant surveys of businesses for January due next week would have to send a very clear signal of an imminent improvement to prevent a rate cut on Jan. 30.
Annual growth in retail sales volumes dropped to 0.9%, below all forecasts in the Reuters poll.
The also ONS revised down its sales data for November. In the fourth quarter as a whole, it found that volumes fell by 1.0%, their worst performance since early 2017.
The survey period ran from Nov. 24 to Dec. 28, including the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales promotions and the Dec. 12 election.
The election outcome eliminated the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit as soon as Jan. 31, and there have been some signs of a bounce in confidence among consumers and companies since then.
But a hit to trade remains possible at the end of 2020, when Johnson insists a post-Brexit transition period will end, regardless of whether he can negotiate a trade deal with the European Union before then.
Consumer demand has been a strong point of the economy since voters decided to leave the EU three-and-a-half years ago. But more recently it has started to soften, despite low unemployment and modest inflation, which have boosted household incomes.
An industry group, the British Retail Consortium, said last week that sales in 2019 as a whole had fallen for the first time since its records began in 1995.
Retailers reported a subdued Christmas season while Sainsbury's (L:SBRY) and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) have said they are not expecting a bounce in consumer spending in 2020."

Total retail sales were up 0.9% over the year in the reported month, a lot weaker than the 2.6% gain expected.

The British Retail Consortium earlier January pointed to the high street suffering the first annual sales decline since 1995. Many retailers, including big high-street names such as John Lewis and Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS), have struggled as political instability and worries over Brexit weighed on consumer confidence.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that business inventories dropped 0.2%, the biggest decline since April 2017, after edging up 0.1% in October. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories would fall 0.1% in November.
Retail inventories decreased 0.8% in November, the most since September 2017, instead of dropping 0.7% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.1% gain in October.
Motor vehicle inventories tumbled 1.8% in November, the biggest drop since September 2017, rather than tumbling 1.6% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, fell 0.2% as reported last month. That was the largest decline since August.
The pace of inventory accumulation accelerated from the third quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of 2019, before shifting lower in the second and third quarters.
Inventory investment had a neutral effect on GDP growth in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% annualized rate in the July-September period. Slow inventory accumulation is expected to offset some of the anticipated boost to fourth-quarter GDP growth from a shrinking trade deficit.

NRF had forecast the online retail sector would grow between 11% and 14%, to between $162.6 billion and $166.9 billion.
Sales of beverage, grocery and furniture also posted strong growth, while sales of apparel, electronics and appliances and sporting goods fell.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday described the economy as having continued to expand modestly in the final six weeks of 2019. The U.S. central bank has signaled that it could keep interest rates unchanged at least through this year after reducing borrowing costs three times in 2019.
""There's more fuel in the tank of this economic expansion,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.3% last month. Data for November was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0.3% instead of rising 0.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.3% in December. Compared to December of last year, retail sales accelerated 5.8%. Sales increased 3.6% in 2019. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 0.5% last month after falling by a downwardly revised 0.1% in November.
The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have edged up 0.1% in November. Core retail sales for October were also revised lower.
Overall sales rose in December despite retailers such as  Target  Corp (N:TGT), Kohl's (N:KSS), J.C. Penney (N:JCP) and Macy's (N:M) reporting a decline in sales for the holiday period as foot traffic in malls dropped.
Though a report last week showed a slowdown in job growth in December and the increase in the annual wage gain retreating to below 3.0%, the labor market remains on solid footing. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000 for the week ended Jan. 11.
Economists had forecast claims would rise to 216,000 in the latest week.
The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) index crossing the 3,300 threshold for the first time, as upbeat earnings from  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and a tech rally added to optimism from an initial U.S.-China trade deal.
SOME RED FLAGS
While claims are trending lower, there are some worrying signs emerging. The claims data showed layoffs in manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, construction, educational services and accommodation and food services industries in late 2019 and early 2020.
Some of the job losses in manufacturing, which were spread across at least eight states, could be related to the 18-month trade war between the United States and China, which has hurt business confidence and undercut capital expenditure. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed a ""Phase 1"" trade deal on Wednesday, a first step toward defusing the trade war.
But with U.S. duties remaining in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two thirds of the total, economists do not expect the initial deal to provide a boost to manufacturing, which is in recession.
A third report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in January, with manufacturers reporting receiving more orders. But a measure of unfilled orders at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware contracted and manufacturers cut hours for employees. 
Even as trade tensions have eased, a pall remains over manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy. Boeing (N:BA) has suspended production of its fast-selling 737 MAX jetliner starting this month and ripple effects are already being felt, with a major supplier announcing layoffs last week.
""Manufacturing will grow at a subdued pace in 2020, constrained by slower external and domestic growth as well as ongoing uncertainty on the trade policy front despite the Phase-one trade deal,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
For now, consumers appear set to continue driving the economy, also thanks to house prices and a bullish stock market.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the third quarter. Given the downward revisions to October and November core retail sales, growth in consumer spending is expected to have slowed to around or below a 2.5% rate in the fourth quarter. 
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are as high as a 2.5% rate, in part because of a drop in imports, which compressed the trade deficit. The economy expanded at a 2.1% pace in the July-September period. 
In December, auto sales fell 1.3%, the biggest drop since last January, after increasing 1.5% in November. Higher gasoline prices lifted receipts at service stations, which jumped 2.8%. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.2% after being unchanged in November.

Sales at electronics and appliance stores rebounded 0.6% in December. Receipts at building material stores surged 1.4% and sales at clothing stores accelerated 1.6%. Spending at furniture stores edged up 0.1%. Americans also spent more at restaurants and bars, with sales rising 0.2% last month. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores rebounded 0.9%.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000 for the week ended Jan. 11, the Labor Department said on Thursday. With the fifth straight weekly drop, claims unwound the surge seen in early December, which was blamed on a later-than-normal Thanksgiving Day. Claims data for the prior week was unrevised.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise to 216,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for Alabama were estimated last week.
The claims data was volatile in late 2019, with applications dropping to 203,000 at the end of November and shooting up to 252,000 in early December.
The claims data showed layoffs in manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, construction, educational service and accommodation and food services industries in late 2019 and early 2020.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil rose in November for the second month in a row, a central bank indicator showed on Thursday, pointing to fairly solid economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The central bank's IBC-Br economic activity index, a leading indicator of gross domestic product (GDP), rose 0.18% in November from October, more than the 0.10% median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists.
In the three months to November, activity was up 0.75%, the central bank said.
The data tie in with other indicators for November showing solid if unspectacular growth in retail sales and the dominant services sector, and are more upbeat than recent purchasing managers index (PMI) figures.
Compared with the same month a year earlier, activity rose 1.10%, the central bank said, and in the three months to November activity was up 1.71% compared with the same period a year earlier.
In first 11 months of last year activity was up 0.95%, and in the year to November it was up 0.9%, the central bank said, largely in line with the growing consensus that the economy's positive momentum accelerated into the fourth quarter from the third.
Latin America's largest economy expanded by 0.6% in the third quarter of last year, more than expected and prompting many economists to revise up their 2019 and 2020 growth forecasts.

The bank left policy unchanged in Christine Lagarde's first meeting as the bank's president but noted that political risk may be ebbing, inflation pressures seem to be building and the bloc's vast manufacturing sector was showing signs of bottoming out, all suggesting that the worst of the recent slowdown by be over.
The ECB has kept money taps wide open for years, trying to boost growth and inflation as the bloc is still working to overcome the lingering effects of a debt crisis that started nearly a decade ago and came close to tearing apart the currency union.
""Incoming data since the last monetary policy meeting pointed to continued weak but stabilizing euro area growth dynamics,"" the accounts of the meeting quoted ECB chief economist Philip Lane as saying. ""Measures of underlying inflation remain generally subdued, although there were some indications of a mild increase.""
The 13 page document however made only a brief mention of the ECB's upcoming policy review, a one-year deep dive that is likely to set course for the bank over much of the next decade and dominates investors' interest.
""It was also suggested that some broad guidance be communicated about the forthcoming strategy review, including the likely timeline, although it was generally seen as advisable to refrain from public discussion on the strategy prior to the envisaged launch of the review,"" the ECB said.
The review, which is expected to provide clearer definition of the inflation target and the ECB's tolerance for any deviation from it has been in the focus since Lagarde took over Nov 1 and is expected to dominate ECB-related newsflow.
Batting back lenders complaints that negative rates are hurting the bank sectors, policymakers argued that the net effect of ECB policies remained positive.
While negative rates were compressing net margins, lending volumes were higher and stronger economic growth kept provisioning levels down.
The ECB added that while interest rates on much of banks' deposit funding could not go below zero, an increasing number of corporate deposits were remunerated at negative rates, also helping margins.
The ECB will next meet on Jan 23, when it is expected to kick off the policy review.
With stimulus already provided through bond buys, negative rates and ultra cheap bank loans, the ECB is expected to keep policy unchanged for most of this year, especially since any big change during a policy review is likely to be controversial."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's housing market got a boost from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's big election win in December, a survey showed on Thursday, a pick-up that will be noted by the Bank of England as it considers whether to cut interest rates this month.
Agreed home sales rose for the first time since May and expectations of future sales both jumped, according to the report by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).
A measure of new buyer inquiries hit its highest level since before the Brexit referendum in 2016.
RICS Chief Economist Simon Rubinsohn said it remained to be seen if the recovery continued, given the uncertainty over whether Britain can strike a trade deal with the European Union before a deadline at the end of 2020.
""However, the sales expectations indicators clearly point to the prospect of more upbeat trend in transactions,"" Rubinsohn said, noting that potential buyers were increasingly following through on initial inquiries.
The RICS survey echoed other early signs of a pick-up in confidence among consumers and companies since Johnson's Conservatives won the election emphatically on Dec. 12, clearing up some of the uncertainty that has weighed on the economy.
RATE DECISION
However, several officials from the Bank of England, including Governor Mark Carney, have said interest rates might need to be cut if the overall economy remains weak. The next BoE rate decision is due on Jan. 30.
""The marked improvement in the December RICS survey provides further evidence that should persuade the BoE that there has been an upswing in sentiment following the election,"" Allan Monks, an economist with JP Morgan, said.
He said the main focus of investors now was the preliminary PMI surveys of British businesses in January which are due to be published on Jan. 24.
Andy Chaytor, a rates strategist at Nomura, said the housing market was one of the best early indicators of economic activity in Britain and he thought the stronger RICS report would lead to a modest increase in next week's PMIs.
Britain's housing market has slowed along with the broader economy since the Brexit referendum.
But in December, the monthly RICS house price balance rose to -2, its highest since June, from -11 in November.
A rebound in the market in London and neighboring southeastern England pushed up new instructions for home sales at a national level.
The housing market in the capital has been particularly hard hit by worries about Brexit in recent months, as well as higher taxes on expensive properties.
The RICS survey was conducted between Dec. 20 and Jan. 9."
1459,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Turkey Slows Pace of Easing, Joins Negative Real-Rate Club","(Bloomberg) -- Sign up here to receive the Davos Diary, a special daily newsletter that will run from Jan. 20-24.
Turkey’s central bank opted for the smallest interest-rate cut since embarking on its easing cycle under a new governor, as it balances demands for further easing from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan against the risk of a market backlash.
The Monetary Policy Committee reduced its key rate on Thursday to 11.25% from 12% at this year’s first scheduled meeting. Its fourth straight decrease pushed the benchmark below zero, when adjusted for inflation. The lira appreciated after the decision and was trading 0.2% stronger at 5.8656 against the dollar as of 2:06 p.m. in Istanbul.
“Considering all factors affecting the inflation outlook, the Committee decided to make a measured cut in the policy rate,” the central bank said in a statement. “At this point, the current monetary policy stance remains consistent with the projected disinflation path.”
Despite the unprecedented scale of easing under Murat Uysal’s watch, the new governor hasn’t provoked investors into turning on Turkey while winning praise from Erdogan, who wants lower borrowing costs to rev up the economy.
The president believes higher rates cause rather than prevent inflation. Most economists and central banks around the world believe the opposite to be true.
While most analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted a cut, expectations ranged widely. The median forecast was for a decrease of 75 basis points. But for the first time since Uysal became governor in July, a sizable minority of economists predicted a hold, after 12 percentage points of easing in the second half of 2019.
Erdogan’s government, which increased its target for growth to 5% for 2020-2022 after slashing last year’s forecast to near zero, is relying on cheaper credit to give the economy an extra kick. Emboldened by a more steady lira, the central bank has so far done its part, but the outlook is turning more tentative.
Turkey’s annual inflation quickened for a second month in December to 11.8%, and policy makers only expect it to start decelerating toward single digits from the second quarter, before ending the year at 8.2%. Economists predict price growth will average around 10% or higher through the third quarter, according to another Bloomberg survey.
Meanwhile, the Turkish lira is off to one of the best starts among the currencies of developing nations this year. It depreciated over 11% against the dollar in 2019, the worst performance in emerging markets after Argentina’s peso.
It’s “a smart move” by the central bank to avoid surprising the market with another bigger-than-forecast cut, according to Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London.
“This is clearly positive for the lira,” he said. “But it doesn’t change our long-term bearish view as the Erdogan administration hasn’t made progress in implementing urgently required structural reforms.”

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>","China's new bank loans hit record in 2019, more stimulus expected","By Judy Hua and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - New bank lending in China hit a record of 16.81 trillion yuan ($2.44 trillion) in 2019 as the central bank eased policy to support the world's second-largest economy hobbled by weak global demand and the Sino-U.S. trade war. 
The central bank has cut borrowing costs to shore up business activity and more monetary easing and fiscal stimulus is expected this year to spur growth, analysts say.
The signing of an initial U.S.-China trade deal this week will help lower economic risks but won't stop Beijing from rolling out more policy measures to weather the downturn.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has tried to boost bank lending and lower financing costs in the past two years, especially for smaller and private companies which generate a sizeable share of the country's economic growth and jobs.
Chinese banks extended 1.14 trillion yuan in new yuan loans in December, down from 1.39 trillion yuan in November and falling slightly short of analyst expectations, data from the PBOC showed on Thursday.
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would fall to 1.19 trillion yuan in December, with total new lending for the year estimated at 16.88 trillion yuan, up from the previous record of 16.17 trillion yuan in 2018.
""Growth in outstanding broad credit was unchanged last month as a slowdown in bank loans outstanding was offset by an easing contraction in shadow credit,"" Capital Economics said in a report.
With recent easing measures having little impact so far on credit growth, that could strengthen the case for additional rate cuts, the research firm said.
Outstanding yuan loans grew 12.3% from a year earlier, a notch below 12.4% growth forecast by analysts and November's pace, which was also 12.4%.
RRR AT APPROPRIATE LEVEL
Analysts say faster credit expansion will be key to stabilizing economic growth, which cooled to 6% in the third quarter of 2019, the slowest since the early 1990s.
Sun Guofeng, head of monetary policy department of PBOC, told a news briefing that China's reserve requirement ratio (RRR) was at an appropriate level and there was limited room for further cuts.
Sun said the average RRR for all banks was at 9.9% but the ratio for small banks was as low as 6%.
To spur lending, the PBOC has cut the amount of cash banks must keep in reserves eight times since early 2018 and pumped out trillions of yuan in liquidity.
China will make timely adjustments to benchmark deposit rates, and should pay more attention to changes in real interest rates when discussing whether to cut interest rates, Sun said.
""Benchmark deposit rates will be kept for a long time,"" Sun said. ""In the future, the PBOC will make appropriate and timely adjustments by considering economic growth, prices and fundamentals, based the on the State Council's arrangement.""
The PBOC has also lowered its key lending rate in recent months, with more cuts expected possibly before the end of this month.
Growth of outstanding total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, was up 10.7% in December from a year earlier, in line with November's growth.
TSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
In December alone, TSF rose to 2.1 trillion yuan from 1.75 trillion yuan in November. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to come in at 1.7 trillion yuan.
PBOC officials said the central bank had recently revised the way it calculates TSF by adding treasury bonds and ordinary local government bonds. 

China had allowed local governments to issue more debt in 2019 as part of a plan to accelerate infrastructure spending and stoke domestic demand.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England warned on Thursday that it could force banks and insurers to hold more capital or use other ""supervisory tools"" as market momentum for ditching the tarnished Libor interest rate benchmark shows signs of flagging.
Ditching Libor, a 50-year-old price reference once dubbed the world's most important number and still embedded in loans from mortgages to credit cards worth $400 trillion globally, is one of the biggest challenges markets have faced in decades.
Banks were fined around $9 billion for trying to rig Libor and regulators say it must be scrapped by the end of 2021 because it is based on too few transactions.
Five heads of supervision from the BoE and the Financial Conduct Authority reiterated to senior managers of firms they regulate that the London Interbank Offered Rate will cease to exist in two years' time, and that no firm should plan otherwise.
""The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) will keep the potential use of supervisory tools under review in light of transition progress made by firms,"" the supervisors said in their letter, which was made public.
The BoE committee looks for threats to financial stability, and said in December that continued reliance on Libor poses risks.
The BoE declined to say on Thursday which tools the FPC could use. It has several powers, including ordering firms to hold more capital or imposing tougher caps on leverage if they present risks not adequately covered by existing buffers.
The regulators reiterated that firms must stop issuing loans linked to Libor by the third quarter of this year, and also encouraged market makers to switch the convention for sterling interest rate swaps from Libor to the replacement rate Sonia, compiled by the BoE, by March 2.
The BoE said in December that progress in moving sterling swaps from Libor to Sonia ""appears to have plateaued"", with more work needed to establish a Sonia-based loans market.
Market analytics firm Clarus said on Tuesday there is no evidence of a reduction in sterling Libor swaps trading, not even for those that mature beyond 2021.
Industry sources told Reuters on Monday that many banks in Britain are unlikely to meet the October deadline to stop writing loans tied to Libor.
Regulators have told firms to present plans for ending the use of Libor and they said on Thursday these are now being scrutinized.

""It will also be a key input to the FPC’s consideration in mid-2020 of whether sufficient progress is being made to avoid seeking recourse to supervisory tools,"" the letter said.

New car registrations rose 21.4% to 1,261,742 vehicles in the European Union and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries in December, statistics by ACEA showed.
The increase was partially due to a low base of comparison with December 2018, when the introduction of anti-emission laws weighed on car registration, ACEA said.
The prospect of higher car taxes, pending to go into effect in 2020, spurred car sales in some EU countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden, where registration surged 113.9% and 109.3%, respectively, ACEA said.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 09:54PM ET</span>",China's December home price growth hits slowest annual pace in almost 1-1/2 years,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices grew at their weakest pace in 17 months in December, with broader curbs on the sector continuing to cool the market in a further blow to the sputtering economy.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 6.6% in December, slowing from a 7.1% gain in the previous month, Reuters calculation based on National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data on Thursday.
It was the slowest pace since July 2018, and significantly weaker than the 9.7% gain seen in December 2018.
But it still marked the 56th straight month of gains, even as China has clamped down on property speculation since 2016 to stop home prices from overheating. With the pace of China's economic growth slowing, policymakers are keen to avoid wholesale squashing of the property market - a pillar of the broader economy.
On a month-on-month basis, home prices edged up 0.3% in December from the previous month, unchanged from the pace in November.
Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS still reported monthly price increases for new homes, though the number was up to 50 from 44 in November, showing some broadening strength in the market.
Beijing has been calling for more targeted city-based policies to foster market stability. Analysts say any sharp drop in home prices would likely not be tolerated by local governments.
Some cities in the past months moved to relax rules by making it easier for graduates to get coveted household registration permits or lowering the requirements for eligible home buyers.
China's southern province of Guangdong said on Tuesday it will ease the residential permit in all its cities except the powerhouses of Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
Many analysts are forecasting a further slowdown in the property market this year and expect specific city-wide relief measures to ensure demand doesn't fall off the cliff.
Price trends have been mixed lately, with some cities showing signs of rapid cooling while others are still plagued with overheating risks.
The so-called tier-3 cities outperformed other city-tiers by rising 0.6% on a monthly basis, quicker than November's 0.5% gain, the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
Yangzhou, a city of 4.6 million in eastern China's Jiangsu province, was the top price performer in the month, with its price increasing 1.3% on a monthly basis.
Meanwhile, price growth in China's four top-tier cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou - slowed from a 0.6% gain in November. They rose 0.2% from a month earlier.
Tier-2 cities, which include most of the larger provincial capitals, increased 0.3% in December on a monthly basis, slightly higher than a 0.2% gain in the previous month."
1466,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 09:16PM ET</span>",Japan posts record machinery orders growth in November in boost to economy,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders posted record monthly growth in November, in a bright sign for business spending which has helped sustain a fragile recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
Cabinet Office data on Thursday showed that core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 18.0% in November from the previous month.
That marked the biggest month-on-month gain since comparable data became available in 2005, and also was the first rise since June.
The jump in November orders was largely driven by big-ticket items, such as orders for railway cars, transport equipment and thermal hydraulic motors. It shattered a 3.2% gain forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and more than recouped an unexpected 6.0% drop in October.
""The surge in 'core' machinery orders in November was largely due to a spike in transport (and) postal activities and we still expect non-residential investment to fall this year,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Given that capital goods shipments probably fell sharply in Q4, we are still forecasting a sizeable 2.3% q/q fall in non-residential investment last quarter,"" he wrote in a note.
Capital expenditure has been a bright spot for the economy in the second and third quarter of last year as companies invested in equipment to prepare for a nationwide tax hike and overcome a tight labor market.
Japan's economy grew at a faster pace than initially reported in July-September last year largely due to upgrades of business and consumer spending.
Many analysts expect the gross domestic product reading for the fourth quarter of 2019 due next month to show a contraction as a sales tax hike from October hit consumption, one of the economy's main growth drivers.
Government data last week showed Japan's inflation-adjusted real wages declined at their fastest pace in four months in November, further clouding the outlook.
OVERALL CAPEX SLUGGISH
Still, the Bank of Japan is likely to revise up slightly its economic forecast for the fiscal year beginning in April to reflect an expected boost from the government's latest spending package, sources familiar with the central bank's thinking said.
Any upward revision will allow the BOJ to justify keeping monetary policy steady at its two-day rate review that ends on Tuesday next week, analysts said.
By sector, manufacturers' orders edged up 0.6%, boosted by steel and ceramics, while core orders from the service-sector surged 27.8%, led by a massive 146.4% month-on-month jump in the transport and postal business.
The data showed overall capital spending remains somewhat sluggish as that surge lifted the headline reading, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
However, the manufacturing sector may be close to bottoming out, said Minami.
""The global economy is showing signs that it has begun to bottom out, so I think machinery orders will start bottoming out as well.""
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity, climbed 5.3% in November, defying a 5.4% contraction seen by economists in a Reuters poll."
1467,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 06:27PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers remain gloomy: Reuters Tankan,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers remained in a pessimistic mood in January as Sino-U.S. trade frictions and sluggish global demand weighed on the export-reliant economy, the Reuters Tankan survey showed.
But some believed conditions would improve in the next few months, according to the monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
Service sector firms, meanwhile, were expected to remain largely upbeat.
The survey came as the World Bank cut its global growth forecasts slightly for 2019 and 2020 due to a slower-than-expected recovery in trade and investment.
In the poll of 502 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 260 firms responded on condition of anonymity, many complained about weak global demand for cars and other goods as well as the hit from Japan's Oct. 1 sales tax hike on consumer sentiment and spending.
""Customers are taking a wait-to-see stance due to effects of the U.S.-China trade war, which has led to inventory adjustments and curbed demand,"" a paper/pulp maker wrote in the survey.
A chemicals maker wrote: ""Car markets are cooling globally with the major Chinese market particularly being weak.""
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
The sentiment index for manufacturers stood at minus 6, unchanged from the previous month, according to the survey conducted Dec. 25-Jan. 10. But it was seen rising to zero in April.
The service-sector index was also unchanged, at plus 14, and was seen slipping one point to plus 13 in April.
The BOJ's tankan showed last month that big manufacturers' mood hit a near seven-year low in October-December as the trade war between the world's two largest economies dragged on.
But business sentiment globally has picked up after Washington and Beijing agreed on a Phase 1 trade deal in mid-December. The agreement, to be signed on Jan. 15, will de-escalate but not end the trade war.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized clip of 1.8% in July-September as brisk business expenditures offset weak external demand, although economists expect the world's third-largest economy to slump in the last quarter as the Oct. 1 sales tax hike bites.
The BOJ is likely to revise up slightly its economic forecast for the fiscal year starting in April to reflect an expected boost from the government's latest spending package, sources familiar with its thinking said.
Any upward revision will allow the central bank to justify keeping monetary policy steady at the Jan. 20-21 rate review."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices edged up in December as a rise in the cost of goods was offset by weakness in services, the latest indication of tame inflation pressures that could allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged this year.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday came in the wake of data on Tuesday showing a small rise in consumer prices in December. Inflation has remained tame even as the unemployment rate has dropped to near a 50-year low and the longest economic expansion on record entered its 11th year.
""There is still little sign of any significant rise in price pressures at the start of the inflation pipeline, underlining our view that the Fed will keep interest rates on hold for the foreseeable future,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London.
The producer price index for final demand ticked up 0.1% last month after being unchanged in November, the government said. In the 12 months through December, the PPI increased 1.3% after gaining 1.1% in November. 
For all of 2019, the PPI rose 1.3%. That was the smallest gain since 2015 and followed a 2.6% increase in 2018.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI climbing 0.2% in December and advancing 1.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices also nudged up 0.1% in December after being unchanged in November. The so-called core PPI rose 1.5% in the 12 months through December after gaining 1.3% in November. Core PPI increased 1.5% in 2019, also the smallest advance since 2015, after rising 2.8% in 2018.
The Fed, which has a 2% annual inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in November, and undershot the Fed's target in the first 11 months of 2019. December PCE price data will be published later this month. 
The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and signaled monetary policy could remain on hold at least through this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. Inflation could remain tame, with the government reporting last Friday that the annual increase in wage growth retreated to below 3.0% in December even as the unemployment rate held at 3.5% and a broader measure of labor market slack dropped to a record 6.7%.
Inflation has been muted despite the United States imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imported Chinese goods. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed an initial trade deal on Wednesday, a first step toward defusing an 18-month trade war.
LETHARGIC MANUFACTURING
Washington suspended some tariffs that had been due to go into effect and halved others. U.S. duties remain in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two thirds of the total. 
The trade war has hurt business confidence, pushing manufacturing into recession. Despite the easing in trade tensions, business sentiment has remained subdued. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the New York Fed said its business conditions index rose to a reading of 4.8 in January from 3.3 in December. It said measures assessing the business outlook over the next six months ""suggested that optimism about future conditions remained restrained.""
While a third report from the Fed showed the economy ""continued to expand modestly in the final six weeks of 2019,"" the central bank said manufacturing activity was ""essentially flat"" in most of the 12 districts. The Fed also noted that ""tariffs and trade uncertainty continued to weigh on some businesses"" in many districts.
""We believe manufacturing activity will remain lethargic this year,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""While the U.S. and China signed the 'Phase One' trade deal today, we believe a resolution to key outstanding disagreements will remain unresolved.""
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 (SPX) near an all-time high.
In December, wholesale energy prices jumped 1.5% after increasing 0.6% in November. They were boosted by a 3.7% acceleration in gasoline prices, which followed a 2.3% rise in November. Goods prices rose 0.3% last month, matching November's rise. Gasoline accounted for more than 60% of the increase in goods prices last month. Wholesale food prices fell 0.2% after surging 1.1% in November. Core goods prices ticked up 0.1% last month. They increased 0.2% in November.
""There is no evidence that tariffs provided manufacturers with the cover to raise prices,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic adviser at Brean Capital in New York.
The cost of services was unchanged in December after dropping 0.3% in November. Prices for healthcare services fell 0.1% in December after slipping 0.2% in the prior month. The weakness in wholesale healthcare costs is in stark contrast with strong readings in December's consumer inflation report. 

Portfolio management fees jumped 1.9% after rebounding 1.2% in November. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index. Economists expect the core PCE price index rose 0.2% in December, though the year-on-year increase probably held steady at 1.6%.

""Economic activity generally continued to expand modestly in the final six weeks of 2019"" and ""wages and prices rose slightly and financial conditions improved modestly,"" the Beige Book regional survey showed.
The modest economic growth was not equal across the nation, however, with Dallas and Richmond districts noting ""above-average growth, while Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City reported sub-par growth,"" it added.
The labor markets remained tight throughout the nation, and most districts cited widespread labor shortages as a factor constraining job growth, but the pace of wage growth remained modest, the report said.
Inflation, meanwhile, continued to rise at a modest pace as did input costs as a number of districts reported that retail selling prices rose at a slightly faster, but still subdued, pace.
The report of modest inflation comes a just day after data showed consumer inflation last month fell short of forecasts."
1470,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","U.S. economy expands modestly but trade tensions weigh, Fed survey shows","By Lindsay Dunsmuir
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy expanded at a modest pace through the final six weeks of 2019 but uncertainty over U.S. trade policy continued to hurt firms, a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday.
""In many districts, tariffs and trade uncertainty continued to weigh on some businesses,"" the Fed said in its report, compiled from anecdotal evidence derived from business contacts across the country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed an initial trade deal at the White House earlier on Wednesday after 18 months of tit-for-tat tariffs between the world's two largest economies that has uprooted supply chains and slowed global growth.
The Fed cut interest rates three times last year, reversing course after three years of periodic rate hikes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the rate cuts as insurance against slowing global growth, the trade tensions and moderate inflation in order to keep the longest economic expansion on record going.
Fed policymakers have since made plain they intend to keep interest rates unchanged for the foreseeable future, citing a boost to the economy from last year's cuts and the easing of tensions in the U.S.-China trade war.
But Fed policymakers have warned the partial trade deal will not eliminate businesses' concerns as U.S. tariffs on China are set to remain in place until a ""Second Phase"" deal is signed.
The latest Fed snapshot of the economy showed that before the deal was signed, many districts were still suffering. The Richmond Fed reported that many manufacturers in its district cited the trade tensions as a major worry.
""Several increased prices of final goods but struggled with low profit margins due to tariffs on raw materials,"" the report said.
However, the prospect of a deal had also spurred some hope. The Chicago Fed district said it had ""boosted farmers' outlooks"" while the Dallas Fed said ""outlooks generally improved, with reduced trade uncertainty boosting optimism.""
Elsewhere in the report, inflation pressures remained relatively subdued with prices rising at a modest pace. Wage growth was described as modest to moderate in most districts despite an unemployment rate near a 50-year-low and businesses reporting widespread labor shortages.
Many at the Fed have grown increasingly concerned that inflation expectations may be slipping. The central bank targets a 2% inflation rate, but has consistently undershot it since the goal was introduced in 2012.
U.S. consumer prices rose slightly less than expected in December and monthly underlying inflation pressures retreated, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday.

Sales volumes grew a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in November from October, official statistics agency IBGE said on Wednesday. It was the seventh straight monthly increase but well below expectations in a Reuters poll, which had forecast a 1.1% rise.
Interest rate futures fell across the board in early trading, and Brazil's currency slipped to its weakest levels in more than a month, as the disappointing data reinforced bets that the central bank could extend a string of rate cuts. (BRBY)
Analysts at Elite Investimentos told clients in a note that the frustrating retail data was driving the falling yield curve.
Economists have struggled in recent years to predict year-end retail sales as the adoption of ""Black Friday"" promotions shifts Brazilians' holiday shopping patterns. Officials said those discounts were the main factor supporting sales activity.
""The fastest-growing sectors in November were the most sensitive to Black Friday, including furniture, electronics and home appliances as well as cosmetics,"" said IBGE research manager Isabella Nunes. ""If it weren't for Black Friday, the result could have been negative.""
Sales of fuel and lubricants fell 0.3% in the month, while apparel and fabric slipped 0.2% in the month.
Nunes said economists' disparate methodology for measuring retail sales may have been behind the errant forecasts, adding that improving consumer sentiment, modest inflation and a recovering job market should support domestic demand.
Still, after recent data showed Brazil's worst November for services activity and industrial output in three and four years, respectively, the disappointing retail figures raised concerns that a weak economic recovery had sputtered at the end of 2019.
The central bank's monetary policy committee, which wraps up its next rate-setting meeting on Feb. 5, has flagged the need for caution in its next moves after four aggressive cuts in a row, adding that decisions will depend on economic data."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy grew by 0.6% in 2019, the weakest expansion rate since 2013 and a marked cooling from the previous year, as export-dependent manufacturers in Europe's largest economy faced increased headwinds from trade disputes and less foreign demand.
The preliminary estimate, released on Wednesday by the Federal Statistics Office, was in line with a Reuters poll of analysts and followed gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.5% in 2018.
""This means that the German economy grew for the tenth year in a row. This is the longest growth period since German reunification (in 1990),"" statistics official Albert Braakmann said.
Stronger private consumption, higher state spending and booming construction helped support growth in 2019 as struggling manufacturers dragged on activity.
Deka Bank analyst Andreas Scheuerle said the German economy had ended an unusually weak year marked by ""bad luck and misery"", pointing to tariff disputes and Brexit uncertainty.
""Without the domestic demand -- this means private consumption, state spending and construction -- the German economy would have entered a recession,"" Scheuerle added.
The statistics office said the public sector, including federal states, municipalities and social security systems, had a budget surplus of 49.8 billion euros ($55.4 billion) or 1.5% of GDP, down from 62.4 billion euros or 1.9% in 2018.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition is at odds over how to spend the federal government's budget surplus of 13.5 billion euros. Her conservatives are calling for corporate tax cuts, while centre-left Finance Minister Olaf Scholz favors more public investment.
Matthew Cady, Investment Strategist at Brooks Macdonald, said the growth data was neither strong enough to assuage growth fears in the euro zone, nor weak enough to convince German policymakers to unleash a big fiscal response.
""It will also likely frustrate the new ECB President (Christine) Lagarde's efforts to push for greater euro zone co-ordination between monetary and fiscal policy,"" he added.

TRADE DRAGS
Exports edged up by 0.9% last year after a 2.1% increase in 2018 while imports rose by 1.9% following a 3.6% jump, the statistics office said.
This meant net trade subtracted 0.4 percentage points from German growth whereas domestic activity contributed 1.0 percentage point, leaving an overall growth rate of 0.6%.
German consumers have benefited recently from record-high employment, inflation-busting pay hikes and low borrowing costs. The construction sector has been boosted by a growing population and the European Central Bank's zero interest rate policies.
Germany's export-dependent manufacturers are contending with sluggish foreign demand as the world economy slows, and uncertainty linked to tariff disputes and Britain's imminent exit from the European Union.
The automobile sector is also struggling to adjust to stricter emissions regulations and a shift to electric vehicles, with leading car companies and suppliers having announced massive job cuts to cope with the challenge.
Production in manufacturing, which makes up roughly a quarter of Germany's economic output, fell by 3.6%, Wednesday's data showed. ""This decrease was mainly caused by weak production in the automobile industry,"" the statistics office said.
Output in the car industry in January-November fell by 11.4% from a year before, statistics official Stefan Hauf added.
The economy ministry said in a monthly report that the industrial sector was still in a weak phase but was likely to reach a turning point soon, citing positive signals from orders and business expectations.
The statistics office said the German economy was carrying little momentum into 2020 after growing only slightly in the fourth quarter.
The German government will update its 2020 growth forecast on Jan. 29 although officials have hinted there will not be any major changes to its autumn forecast. In October, Berlin predicted 1.0% growth for 2020, helped by a higher number of working days. Calendar-adjusted, it expects 0.6% growth.
""The economy will continue to move sideways in 2020,"" said DIHK managing director Martin Wansleben. He called for both more investment in public infrastructure and corporate tax cuts to give the economy a fiscal push."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's budget deficit jumped 70% last year as the government boosted spending before local elections in the face of a recession, while aggressive monetary stimulus gave the housing market a big boost heading into the new year.
The deficit was 123.7 billion lira ($21 billion) in 2019, just below a government forecast. One-off contributions, including tapping central bank legal reserves, offset the spending and could make future forecasts hard to meet, analysts said. Once 2019's economic output is calculated, the deficit is likely to come around the government's estimate of 2.9% of GDP.
In December alone, the deficit was 30.8 billion lira ($5.2 billion), while the primary budget balance, which excludes interest payments, showed a deficit of 26.59 billion lira, the Treasury and Finance Ministry said.
Ankara said in September that it expected to limit deficits in 2020 and 2021 to 2.9% of GDP https://tmsnrt.rs/36WwbI2, while it expects GDP growth to jump to an ambitious 5%. The economy emerged from recession in 2019 after a currency crisis in 2018.
Haluk Burumcekci, of Burumcekci Consulting, said 2019 revenues had been boosted by central bank profits, transfers from legal reserves, one-off contributions and tax restructurings.
For 2020, he said, ""the target of 2.9% does not look realistic without additional measures"".

Data from Turkish state banks show that mortgage rates dropped to as low as 0.79% in January, nearly half the rate a year earlier.
""Apart from the lower mortgage rates, a sharp decline in deposit rates also supported home sales, with people preferring to invest in housing instead of leaving money in banks,"" said Makbule Yonel Maya, general manager of TSKB Real Estate Appraisal.
Deposit rates fell to about 10% in December from 20% at the beginning of last year.
The central bank announces its latest interest rate decision on Thursday at 1100 GMT. In a Reuters poll on Monday, the median estimate was for a rate cut of 50 basis points, with eight out of 21 economists expecting it would keep the rate steady.
In 2019 as a whole, house sales declined 1.9% to 1.35 million, with sharp rises in the latter part of the year compensating for a slump in the first half.
House sales to foreigners climbed 14.7% in 2019 to more than 45,000 houses, the institute said. Iraqi citizens were the biggest buyers of Turkish properties last year, followed by Iranians, Russians, Saudi Arabians and Afghans."

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation sank unexpectedly to a more than three-year low in December as hotels slashed prices, ramping up expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates as soon as this month.
Consumer prices rose by 1.3% in annual terms compared with 1.5% in November, the smallest increase since November 2016, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.
The pound slid below $1.30 and British government bond prices shot higher on the reading, which was below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to another 1.5% increase.
Since the turn of the year, BoE officials have voiced concerns about the strength of Britain's economy, raising expectations in financial markets that they could vote to cut interest rates as soon as this month.
Earlier on Wednesday, BoE rate-setter Michael Saunders said interest rates should be cut straight away, citing a weak labor market and a sluggish economy, to avoid Britain getting stuck in a low-inflation trap as in the euro zone.
Although Wednesday's data showed inflation for the fourth quarter as a whole matched the BoE's 1.4% forecast it made in November, the surprise drop in price pressures last month bolstered expectations of stimulus.
Money markets now price in a roughly 56% chance of a rate cut in January, compared with 49% before Wednesday's data.
""These figures back up outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney's suggestion that there is clear headroom to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy if required,"" said Robert Alster, head of investment services at Close Brothers Asset Management.
The ONS said a third of hotels surveyed in December reported falling prices, compared with only one in 10 reporting an increase.
Women's clothing prices also fell, the ONS said.
A measure of core inflation, which excludes energy, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, dropped to its lowest since November 2016 at 1.4%, down from 1.7% in November.
Inflation pressure in the pipeline -- measured through factory prices -- remained muted. Prices of manufactured products rose 0.9% on the year, as expected in the Reuters poll.
Separate data from the ONS showed house prices rose by an annual 2.2% in November, the biggest rise in a year, adding to tentative signs of stabilization in the housing market.

The employment rate climbed to 60.9% last year, boosted by an increase in part-time work, statistics office data showed Wednesday. At first glance, the figure appears to contradict the view among Moon’s opponents and some economists that his policies, including a higher minimum wage strategy, have priced people out of work.
That’s a rare slice of good news for Moon as his party faces a mid-term election in April amid questions over his purging of prosecutors looking into corruption and his handling of the economy. Moon’s own term as president lasts until 2022.
Still, the employment growth has largely relied on part-time and elderly workers entering the work force. The low paid and unstable nature of the extra jobs have economists casting doubt on the real strength of the recovery in the labor market and its likely effectiveness in boosting consumption.
“If you just look at the headline figure, the numbers seem to have improved, but a breakdown shows jobs for the core age group and the key manufacturing sector aren’t getting any better,” said An Young-jin, an economist for SK Securities, ahead of the latest release.
“Jobs data should be better in 2020 considering the bigger budget and an expected economic recovery, but I doubt whether the improvement will be sustainable enough to support wages and income,” he said.
The jobless rate, meanwhile, was 3.8% in December on a seasonally adjusted basis, well below the 4.4% marked at the start of 2019, Wednesday’s statement showed.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 11:29AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices gain slightly; underlying inflation tame,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose slightly in December even as households paid more for healthcare, and monthly underlying inflation slowed, supporting the Federal Reserve's desire to keep interest rates unchanged at least through this year.
The weak inflation report from the Labor Department on Tuesday came on the heels of data last week showing a moderation in job growth in December. Economists said these developments were flagging a sharp slowdown in domestic demand. Though the economy appears to have maintained a steady pace of growth in the fourth quarter, it was likely supported by falling imports.
""This is giving rise to the fear that maybe economic demand is showing early signs of hitting a new soft patch for growth that will carry into the first quarter of 2020,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The Federal Reserve is on the sidelines this year, but that could swiftly change if overall economic demand weakens and inflation shows little sign of returning to target."" 
The Labor Department said its consumer price index increased 0.2% last month after climbing 0.3% in November. The monthly increase in the CPI has been slowing since jumping 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through December, the CPI rose 2.3%. That was the largest increase since October 2018 and followed a 2.1% gain year-on-year in November. 
The CPI accelerated 2.3% in 2019, the largest rise since 2011, after increasing 1.9% in 2018. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would rise 0.3% in December and advance 2.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1% after climbing 0.2% in November. The so-called core CPI was up by an unrounded 0.1133% last month compared to 0.2298% in November. 
Underlying inflation in December was held back by declines in the costs of used cars and trucks, airline tickets and household furnishing and operations, which offset increases in the prices of healthcare, apparel, new motor vehicles, recreation and motor vehicle insurance.
In the 12 months through December, the core CPI increased 2.3%, the largest gain since October 2018, after rising 2.3% in November. For all of 2019, the core CPI gained 2.3% after increasing 2.2% in 2018. 
The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies as investors awaited the signing on Wednesday of a preliminary trade deal between the United States and China, a first step toward diffusing an 18-month trade war. U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
HEALTHCARE COSTS RISE 
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2.0% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in November. It undershot its target in the first 11 months of 2019. PCE price data for December will be published later this month.
The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and signaled monetary policy could remain on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. 
Minutes of the Fed's Dec. 10-11 meeting published early this month showed policymakers generally expected inflation would eventually hit the central bank's target as the economy continued to expand and resource utilization remained high. 
There were, however, concerns among some officials ""that global or technology-related factors were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome.""
Moderate inflation was underscored by the employment report last Friday, showing the increase in annual wage growth retreating below 3.0% in December, despite the unemployment rate holding at near a 50-year low of 3.5% and a broader measure of labor market slack dropping to a record 6.7%.
Weak inflation offered no boost to consumers' purchasing power, with average weekly earnings slipping 0.1% last month after edging up 0.1% in November. This could hurt consumer spending, which is already slowing.
""It is hard for the average household to keep up the spending we have seen if their spending power is going nowhere,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
In December, gasoline prices advanced 2.8% after rising 1.1% in November. Food prices gained 0.2% after edging up 0.1% in November. Food consumed at home ticked up 0.1%.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.2% for a third straight month. 
Healthcare costs jumped 0.6% in December after rising 0.3% in the prior month. They were boosted by a 2.1% acceleration in prices for prescription medication. Consumers also paid more for hospital services and doctor visits. 
Healthcare costs surged 4.6% in 2019, the largest gain since 2007 and up compared to 2.0% in 2018.
""It may be too early to conclude this, but it is beginning to look like the current laissez-faire approach to health care is allowing providers to ramp up prices,"" said Naroff.
Apparel prices increased 0.4% after nudging up 0.1% in November. New vehicle prices rebounded 0.1% after declining for five straight months. Prices for used motor vehicles and trucks dropped 0.8% last month after increasing 0.6% in November.

The cost of household furnishings and operations dropped 0.4% in December, the largest decrease since December 2014. Airline fares fell 1.6%, declining for a third straight month.

1479,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 08:43AM ET</span>",U.S. Core Consumer-Price Gauge Increases by Less Than Forecast,"(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of underlying U.S. inflation rose less than forecast in December, restrained in part by a deceleration in shelter costs and underscoring the Federal Reserve’s view that price pressures are muted.
The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.1% in December from the prior month, the smallest advance in three months, a Labor Department report showed Tuesday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.2% rise. Compared with a year earlier, the core CPI rose 2.3%, in line with estimates. The broader CPI increased 0.2% and 2.3% from December 2018, both below forecast.
The subdued gain in costs of household goods and services indicates Fed policy makers can hold the line on interest rates for much, if not all, of this year. Fed officials reduced the target range for their benchmark rate three times in 2019 and signaled they will remain on hold for the near future or until the economic outlook shows a material change.
The Labor Department’s CPI tends to run higher than the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index, which the Fed officially targets. The core PCE index that policy makers watch for a better read on underlying price trends softened in November, rising 1.6% from the same month in 2018. Core PCE has held below the 2% objective for the better part of seven years.
While inflation remains relatively contained, the 2.3% full-year increase in the core CPI gauge was the fastest for a calendar year since 2.4% in 2007.
The Labor Department’s CPI report showed shelter costs, which make up about a third of total CPI, decelerated. They rose 0.2% after a 0.3% gain in November, and were up 3.2% year-over-year for the smallest advance since January last year. Both owners-equivalent rent, one of the categories that tracks rental prices, and rent of primary residence climbed 0.2% from a month earlier.
The CPI was also restrained by a 0.8% monthly decline in used car and truck prices. They were down 0.7% from a year earlier, the biggest year-over-year drop since September 2018.
Prices of household furnishings and operations decreased 0.4% in December, the largest monthly decline in five years. Airfares also fell for a third straight month.
Energy prices rose 1.4% from the prior month as gasoline prices climbed 2.8%. Food costs increased 0.2%, and expenses for medical care were up 0.6%.
Apparel prices, which tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis, rose 0.4%, the most in five months.
The report showed new vehicle prices increased for the first time since June.
A separate Labor Department report Tuesday showed average hourly earnings, adjusted for price changes, rose 0.6% in December from a year earlier after 1.1% the previous month. The monthly jobs report last week had already showed an unexpected deceleration in nominal wages.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the core CPI to rise 0.2% from the prior month and 2.3% from a year earlier, with the broader index seen rising 0.3% and 2.4% on a year-over-year basis.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rose for the first time in five months in December and by more than expected, signaling a modest recovery in demand as Beijing and Washington agreed to defuse their prolonged trade war.
The world's largest economies are set to sign a Phase 1 trade deal on Wednesday, marking a significant de-escalation but not an end to a dispute that has rattled financial markets and threatened to derail global economic growth.
After a rough year, China's exports ended 2019 on an upbeat note, rising 7.6% in December from a year earlier, customs data showed on Tuesday. The median forecast from a Reuters poll of analysts had been for a 3.2% rise in shipments, following November's 1.3% drop.
Imports also beat expectations, jumping 16.3% from a year earlier, though boosted in part by higher commodity prices. The Reuters poll had forecast 9.6% growth versus 0.5% in November.
While comparisons with a weak December last year flattered both figures, they also pointed to improving demand, both globally and within China, analysts said.
China posted a trade surplus of $46.79 billion in December, compared with the poll's forecast for a $48 billion surplus and up from November's surplus of $37.93 billion.
For all of 2019, its total exports proved remarkably resilient to trade tensions, rising 0.5%, though that was well off a near 10% gain in 2018, reflecting weaker U.S. sales.
Imports fell 2.8% last year as China's economic growth cooled to near 30-year lows, after rising 15.8% in 2018.
THAWING TENSIONS
China's better-than-expected trade numbers come amid a flurry of trust-building gestures from both sides ahead of the signing of the Phase 1 deal.
The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday China should no longer be designated a currency manipulator - a label it applied as the yuan currency dropped in August.
On Tuesday, China's customs vice minister Zou Zhiwu told a briefing that its soybean and pork imports from the U.S. rebounded significantly in December and positive trade sentiment has boosted companies' confidence.
But overall growth in imports from the U.S. saw less of an pick-up than shipments from other countries in December, analysts from Capital Economics said in a note.
China's trade surplus with the United States for December stood at $23.18 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data, down from November's surplus of $24.60 billion.
China exports to the United States fell 12.5% in 2019, compared with a rise of 11.3% in 2018. Imports from the United States fell 20.9%, versus a 0.7% rise in the previous year.
Overall sentiment improved last month after the two sides reached the Phase 1 deal, which is expected to cut tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of U.S. farm, energy and manufactured goods while addressing some disputes over intellectual property.
Beijing has pledged to buy nearly an additional $80 billion of U.S. manufactured goods over the next two years, plus over $50 billion more in energy supplies, according to a source briefed on the deal.
But companies remain cautious. U.S. tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese imports will remain in place, and memories are fresh of a breakdown in an apparent deal last May which triggered a series of series of tit-for-tat tariff escalations.
The Phase 1 deal ""stops the bleeding"" but does not end the trade war, a senior U.S. Chamber of Commerce official said on Monday, warning that significant challenges remain.
Analysts say the risk of further complications and re-escalation remains.
""Our judgment is Phase 1 will not put an end to Trump Trade Wars,"" analysts with MUFG Bank wrote in a research note prior to the data.
Moreover, global demand is expected to remain soft this year, offering Chinese exporters only modest relief.
""The effective tariff reduction from the Phase 1 deal is fairly small, so any bounce in exports may not be terribly exciting..."" ING economists said in a note before the data on Tuesday.
""The bottom line (is) China's trade circumstances are still relatively weak, and the tariffs much higher than they were 18 months ago. We should not expect miracles.""
Oxford Economics believes U.S.-China trade could stay depressed for years.
DOMESTIC DEMAND
Rising Chinese imports of raw materials, meanwhile, are adding to signs that domestic demand may turning the corner after nearly two years of government growth boosting measures.
Unwrought copper imports rose 9.1% in December from the previous month to their highest since March 2016, while iron ore imports were the highest in 27 months.
Manufacturing activity in China, the world's biggest copper consumer, expanded in December as signs of progress in trade talks boosted factories' output and order books.
China's crude oil imports in 2019 surged 9.5% from a year earlier, setting a record for a 17th straight year.
But it is still too early to say there has been a marked pick-up in its domestic demand, as the overall import growth figure comes off a weak December last year and was helped more by higher import prices than higher volumes, said the analysts at Capital Economics.
While the outlook for exports is improving, domestic demand will remain subdued, they said."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's rare earth exports bounced back in December from a four-and-a-half-year low the previous month as buyers ramped up purchases ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, though annual shipments still sank to their lowest in four years, hit by weaker global manufacturing demand.
China, the world's dominant producer of rare earths - a group of 17 minerals used in consumer electronics and military equipment - exported 3,657 tonnes of the material in December, data from the General Administration of Customs released on Tuesday showed.
That was up 39% from 2,636 tonnes in November, the lowest monthly total since May 2015, but still a third lower than the bumper 5,421 tonnes exported in December 2018.
""December exports tend to rise as buyers look to stock up in advance of the Chinese holiday season,"" Ryan Castilloux, managing director of consultancy Adamas Intelligence said by email ahead of the data release.
China will celebrate the week-long Lunar New Year holiday from Jan. 24.
Full-year rare earth shipments came in at 46,330 tonnes in 2019, the lowest annual total since 2015, the data showed.
""On the year, exports have been weakened by a sluggish manufacturing sector - particularly in the U.S. and Japan - due in large part to the ongoing U.S.-China trade war,"" Castilloux said.
Beijing in May last year raised the prospect of limiting rare earth exports to the United States in retaliation for U.S. tariffs, although it did not publicly announce any restrictions.
It has since raised annual rare earth output quotas to record highs and is set to sign a 'Phase 1' deal in Washington this week to resolve the long-running Sino-U.S. trade row."

The U.K. economy unexpectedly shrank ahead of the general election, casting doubt over whether there was any growth at all in the fourth quarter.
The figures will add to concerns at the Bank of England, where officials are debating whether further stimulus might be needed if economic weakness persists.
Gross domestic product fell 0.3% in November, the Office for National Statistics said Monday. Economists had expected unchanged output. It means growth of 0.1% to 0.2% was needed in December to prevent the economy contracting in the fourth quarter.
Markets have stepped up bets on an interest-rate reduction sooner rather than later after BOE Governor Mark Carney said there is plenty of room to act if necessary and policy makers Silvana Tenreyro and Gertjan Vlieghe warned they could join colleagues calling for cheaper borrowing costs. The pound is heading for its fifth day of decline.
The latest growth figures reflect caution in the run-up to the December election, with the dominant services industry contracting 0.3% -- the biggest decline since early 2018.
Overall economic growth of 0.6% from a year earlier was the weakest since mid-2012.
Surveys taken after the election suggest Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s emphatic victory delivered a sharp boost to confidence. The question is whether that momentum can be maintained.
Britain is due to leave the European Union at the end of the month, and many doubt Johnson can deliver on his pledge to strike a trade deal with the bloc by the end of the year. If he fails, Britain will once again be facing a disruptive cliff-edge Brexit.
Upward revisions to recent months mean the economy expanded 0.1% between September and November, slightly better than expected though still the weakest performance since July.
Manufacturing output fell 1.7% in November, partly reflecting car factories shutting down to avoid supply disruptions around the now-postponed Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. Auto output alone fell more than 6%. Construction output rose 1.9%, rebounding from a weak October.
The trade deficit narrowed sharply in November as imports plunged almost 12%. The gap halved to 5.3 billion pounds, and trade with non-EU countries recorded a surplus for the first time since records began in 1998. However, the improvement was driven by flows of unspecified goods, which include non-monetary gold."

There’s also evidence that people who migrate within the country for employment are sending less money home to some of the poorest states, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser for the nation’s biggest bank, wrote in a report on Monday. The data indicate that India’s consumption and tax collections could stay weak for longer, he said.
Poor job creation risks worsening the highest unemployment rate in 45 years and build pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, which is already battling the weakest economic growth in more than a decade and student-led street protests. Asia’s third-largest economy is officially forecast to expand 5% this financial year, stronger than SBI’s prediction of 4.6%.
More than 12,000 unemployed people died by suicide in India in 2018, India Today reported based on latest government data published last week. That’s more than one person each hour. The number is higher than in 2017, and accounts for almost 10% of total suicides in the country.
Pronab Sen, India’s former chief statistician, last week told The Wire that India is also seeing a decline in informal jobs. The drop can be linked back to Modi’s November 2016 decision to overnight invalidate 86% of the country’s currency, which broke the back of the nation’s vast, cash-based economy, he said.
“The young, the untrained, the unskilled, would get their first break in the informal sector,” Sen said. “They would pick up skills on the job, and then they would get picked up by more formal establishments. That stream has been broken.”

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 10:23AM ET</span>","U.S. job growth cools in December, but labor market tight","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in December, but the pace of hiring likely remains sufficient to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track despite a deepening downturn in a manufacturing sector stung by trade disputes.
The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday also showed the jobless rate holding near a 50-year low of 3.5%. A broader measure of unemployment dropped to a record low last month, but wage gains ebbed. The mixed report will probably not change the Federal Reserve's assessment that both the economy and monetary policy are in a ""good place.""
""There is nothing here that changes the picture of an economy that is continuing to expand at a pace that exceeds its potential growth rate,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""The Fed should be very comfortable with this report.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 jobs last month, with manufacturing shedding jobs after being boosted in November by the return to work of about 46,000 production workers at General Motors (N:GM) after a strike, the government's survey of establishments showed. That was the smallest gain since May.
But milder-than-normal temperatures in December boosted hiring at construction sites, and employment at retailers surged last month. Some of the slowdown in overall job growth in December is likely due to seasonal volatility associated with a later-than-normal Thanksgiving Day. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 164,000 jobs in December.
Roughly 100,000 jobs per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. Data for October and November was revised to show 14,000 fewer jobs added than previously reported. The economy created 2.1 million jobs in 2019, down from 2.7 million in 2018.
Reports on housing, trade and consumer spending have suggested that the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, is not in immediate danger of being derailed by a recession. Worries that a downturn might be triggered by the Trump administration's trade war with China spurred the Fed to cut interest rates three times in 2019.
Indeed economic growth did slow last year, throttling back to 2.1% in the third quarter from 2018's brisk pace of nearly 3%. Now, though, with a Phase 1 deal with China set to be signed next week, policymakers are more confident in the outlook and last month signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through this year. Economists are pegging growth at the end of last year around a 2.3% rate.
The dollar firmed slightly against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading marginally higher.
TIGHT LABOR MARKET
The labor market has continued to churn out jobs at a healthy clip, despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages, which economists had feared would significantly restrain hiring.
There are, however, concerns the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which compiles the employment data, may not be fully capturing the impact on payrolls of President Donald Trump's 18-month-long trade war with China, which has pushed manufacturing into recession and led to company closures.
The government last August estimated that the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade. That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The revised payrolls data will be published next month.
The projected massive revision has attracted the attention of some Fed officials. Minutes of the U.S. central bank's Dec. 10-11 policy meeting published last week showed a ""couple"" of officials viewed the anticipated downgrade as an indication ""that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year.""
Economists say downward revisions of that magnitude suggest that the model the government uses to calculate the net number of jobs from new business and closings is faulty. Some expect payrolls growth beyond last March could also be revised down.
For now, the labor market is on solid footing, with the unemployment rate declining by five-tenths of a percentage point in 2019. There was little impact on the jobless rate from annual revisions to the seasonally adjusted household survey data going back five years, which were incorporated in December's employment report.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 6.7% in December, the lowest since the series started in 1994, from 6.9% the prior month. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was steady at 63.2% last month.
The tight labor market, however, has struggled to generate strong wage inflation. Average hourly earnings rose three cents, or 0.1% last month, after increasing 0.3% in November. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 2.9% in December from 3.1% in November.
Manufacturing employment dropped by 12,000 jobs in December after jumping 58,000 in November as the GM strike ended. The Institute for Supply Management's measure of national factory activity dropped in December to its lowest level since June 2009. Manufacturing added only 46,000 job in 2019 compared to 264,000 in 2018.
Hiring at construction sites increased by 20,000 jobs in December. There were increases in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, financial activities, education and healthcare, retail and wholesale trade employment last month. But the transportation and warehousing industry lost 10,400 jobs, and mining and logging shed 9,000 positions.
Government employment rose by 6,000 jobs. It is expected to accelerate in the coming months amid increased hiring for the 2020 Census."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada gained a higher-than-expected 35,200 net jobs in December, entirely in full-time positions, while the unemployment rate fell to 5.6%, official data showed on Friday, figures that could ease some concerns about the strength of the Canadian economy. 
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 25,000 jobs in December and an unemployment rate of 5.8%. Wages for permanent employees rose by 3.8%, Statistics Canada said, lower than the 4.4% gain seen in each of the previous two months. 
Canada shed an unexpected 71,200 net jobs in November, the biggest decline since 2009, while the national unemployment rate rose to 5.9%.
""It's a decent rebound,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
""It should put some of the immediate fears around the Canadian economy not to rest, but certainly make them a little bit less intense,"" he added.
The Canadian dollar strengthened after the jobs gain, touching 1.3032 to the U.S. dollar, or 76.73 cents U.S.
The Bank of Canada has held its overnight interest rate steady since October 2018 even as several of its counterparts, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have eased. The central bank's next interest rate decision is set for Jan 22. 
Addressing a business audience on Thursday in Vancouver, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said the central bank would be watching to see if the recent slowdown in job creation persisted.
""I think (Poloz) will be pleased to see that rebound in jobs numbers in December,"" said Josh Nye, a senior economist with RBC.
Full-time employment, Statistics Canada said on Friday, increased by 38,400 net positions, while part-time employment dropped by 3,200. 
Meanwhile, Canada's goods-producing industries gained 15,700 net jobs, mainly in construction. The services sector saw an increase of 19,400 net positions, largely in accommodation and food services.
Friday's stronger-than expected jobs report follows a recent string of unimpressive domestic data analysts have said could point to the fourth-quarter annualized economic growth coming in below the central bank's 1.3% forecast in October.
""I think (the Bank of Canada) will be relieved they didn't get another negative,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets. ""There would be much more concern if you got three consecutive negative prints on the headline."" 

Poloz said Thursday the most recent economic data had been mixed, telling reporters the fourth quarter had seen some unusual weather and strikes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson's emphatic election win last month has led to a burst of optimism among British businesses and consumers, according to some early signals from the economy.
Johnson's success in securing a large parliamentary majority, which ended a period of deadlock in Westminster, means Britain is on course to leave the European Union on Jan. 31 and start an 11-month, no-change transition period.
It also ended the prospect of a shift to the left in British politics. The opposition Labour Party had proposed nationalizing key industries, taking stakes in many other companies and more state intervention.
However, some economists are skeptical about whether the pickup in confidence will translate into a meaningful boost to growth, which has lost momentum since the Brexit referendum in 2016 and slowed to a crawl in late 2019.
Some businesses worry that Johnson's refusal to contemplate asking for an extension to the Brexit transition period - even if Britain has not sealed a new trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020 - risks creating another ""cliff edge.""
Below are some of the early signals that show an improvement in optimism after the Dec. 12 election.
CFOs CHEER UP
Accountants Deloitte said on Friday that 53% of chief financial officers were more optimistic about their companies' prospects than three months previously, the highest share since records started in 2008.
(GRAPHIC: Business confidence among CFOs hits record high - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/652/648/deloitte.png)
The Deloitte survey was conducted entirely after the election and chimed with the business expectations component of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - a closely watched gauge of British business - which hit its highest level in December since September 2018.
The PMI was up markedly from a preliminary reading for the month that was based only on responses before the election, indicating a clear improvement in sentiment after the vote.
Nonetheless, the overall picture of the economy from the PMI remained consistent with no growth in the fourth quarter.
(GRAPHIC: Decisive election result cheers UK businesses - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/648/644/final%20flash.png)
CONSUMERS MORE CONFIDENT
The public became much more upbeat about the prospects for Britain's economy after the election, according to a survey commissioned by payment card company Barclaycard.
The proportion of people who said they were confident about the economy's future rose 10 points to 41%, the highest since March 2017, according to the survey of 2,000 people conducted by Longitude Research from Dec. 17 to 19.
However, in recent years analysts have doubted how much consumer confidence in the economy really matters.
Britons have been among the most downbeat about their country's economic prospects of all European Union countries, according to European Commission data, but their spending has continued to power the economy.
Conversely, while the Barclaycard survey showed an increase in optimism among consumers, the British Retail Consortium reported dismal Christmas trading for major store chains.

JOBS BOOST?
British employers increased hiring of permanent staff from job agencies last month for the first time in a year, a survey from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) showed, another sign of higher business confidence.
The survey was conducted Dec. 5 to Dec. 17, straddling the election result.
""With a new government in place and the path ahead looking more predictable, some businesses have decided that they have waited long enough,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.

1492,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 10:12PM ET</span>",Australian Retail Sales Jump Most in 2 Years on Black Friday,"(Bloomberg) -- Australians opened their wallets in November to take advantage of Black Friday sales, providing a much-needed boost for retailers that have struggled in an environment of record-high household debt and stagnant real wages.Retail sales surged 0.9% in the month before Christmas, more than double economists’ 0.4% estimate, as consumers took advantage of steep discounts to buy up ahead of the traditional holiday period, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed in Sydney Friday. The result sets up a potentially weak December if typical festive spending was pulled-forward. December sales have actually declined in the prior two years.
“The emergence of Black Friday in Australia’s retail landscape has boosted sales,” said James McIntyre, chief economist for Australia at Bloomberg Economics. “But the pull forward of Christmas spending has also set up the December figures for a very poor outcome, which will be compounded by the impacts of bush fires and smoke pollution across Australia’s major economic centers. The slump in consumer sentiment over recent weeks is likely to weigh on spending into January as well.”
The result is likely to bring some relief to the Reserve Bank and government after Australians opted to use last year’s three interest-rate reductions to pay down their mortgages faster and saved their tax rebates, third-quarter GDP data showed. Today’s figures also show the rising importance of online spending, with with e-retailing’s share of turnover climbing to 7.1% from 6.6% in November 2018.
Breaking down the data, department stores and clothing, footwear and personal accessories both rose by more than 3%. Indeed, of the six categories surveyed, only one -- other retailing -- fell in the month.
“We have seen strong growth in Black Friday sales, both in areas such as electrical goods and online sales, but also in areas such as clothing and furniture,” said Ben James, an official at the statistics office. “While seasonal adjustment removes regular seasonal patterns associated with Black Friday based on prior results, the strong seasonally adjusted rises in a number of sub-groups this month shows that the impact of this Black Friday exceeded that of previous years.”
The Australian dollar rose 0.2% following the release and was trading at 68.63 U.S. cent at 12:38 p.m. in Sydney, little changed from Thursday’s close. Traders scaled back pricing for a February rate cut to less than 50% following the retail figures.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail sales surged past all expectations in November led by pre-Christmas shopping though early indicators point to weak spending in December, suggesting the economy remained in the doldrums in the final quarter of 2019.
Data out Friday showed retail sales jumped 0.9% in November - the biggest rise since February 2019 - to A$27.91 billion ($19.13 billion) boosted by 'Black Friday' sales. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.4% gain.
Clothing, home wares, department stores, restaurants and eating out all saw gains in the month.
""The trend in sales has deteriorated, such that faster growth in November partly reflects the increased popularity of Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales,"" NAB economists wrote in a note.
""If sales exceed our forecast that could reflect a bring forward of Xmas spending, where December sales have become less important over time.""
Australia's A$1.95 trillion ($1.3 trillion) economy has hit a soft patch after more than 28 years without a recession as consumers struggling with stagnant wages and sky-high debt sharply cut back on spending
Weak private consumption has come despite the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) three interest rate cuts to 0.75% last year. Government giveaways also provided little impetus with billions in tax rebates being saved rather than spent.
The economic doldrum is becoming an increasing headache for Prime Minster Scott Morrison given he won re-election in May on a pledge the economy would always be stronger under his guidance.
The worst bushfire season on record, that has scorched more than 10 million hectares of land and destroyed thousands of home in recent months, is also likely to weigh on consumption, at least in the near-term.
Some economists are predicting the bushfire crisis could put a brake on Australia's economic growth this quarter, that could force an interest rate cut as soon as February.
Investors are wagering policy makers will have to do more to revive spending and futures are pricing in a 40% chance of a rate cut by February .
In signs of the early impact from the catastrophic fires, a gauge of Australian consumer confidence slumped last week to its lowest level in more than four years. Job advertisements suffered their largest monthly drop in seven months in December."
1494,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 08:11PM ET</span>",UK employers hire more permanent staff for first time in a year,"LONDON (Reuters) - British employers last month increased their number of new permanent staff for the first time in a year, reflecting a modest rise in optimism after December's election, a survey of recruiters showed on Friday.
The figures from the Recruitment & Employment Confederation, a trade body, add to signs that business confidence nudged up at the tail end of 2019, after being depressed by uncertainty over Brexit and the unclear political outlook.
""With a new government in place and the path ahead looking more predictable, some businesses have decided that they have waited long enough,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
REC's permanent staff placement index rose to 51.9 in December from 48.8 in November, its highest since December 2018 and above the 50-mark that divides growth from contraction for the first time since February.
A broader index of demand for staff rose to a three-month high, as demand for temporary staff accelerated by less.
Official data, which tends to lag behind trends in the REC data, showed renewed hiring in the three months to November after the biggest loss of jobs in four years during the three months to October. Unemployment is its lowest since 1975.
The REC survey took place between Dec. 5 and Dec. 17, so included responses after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a large majority, removing doubts over whether Britain would see a big shift in political direction under Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn or delay its Jan. 31 European Union departure.
A separate survey of purchasing managers by financial data company IHS Markit, published on Monday, showed increased optimism from firms polled after the election compared with those who replied just before.
However, the REC said some of the pick-up in demand for permanent staff could reflect tax changes that make it harder for employers to avoid social security payments by classifying workers as self-employed contractors.
Johnson has also said he will not seek any extension to a tariff-free post-Brexit transition period, raising the prospect of business disruption next year if long-term trade talks cannot be concluded swiftly.
""Lingering uncertainty around the Brexit deal to be secured will continue to weigh on employers' decision making around hiring and investment over the coming months, as well as job-seekers desires to seek new opportunities,"" said James Stewart, Vice Chair of accountants KPMG, who sponsor the survey."
1495,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 07:16PM ET</span>",Irish consumers buoyed by Brexit deal in December,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish consumer sentiment improved in December to post the first back-to-back monthly gain in four years as the risk of a damaging 'no-deal' Brexit receded, according to a survey published on Friday.
Ireland has remained the European Union's fastest growing economy during three years of Brexit talks, but consumer confidence faltered when it seemed that its nearest neighbor could leave the bloc without agreeing to a withdrawal deal.
The KBC Bank consumer sentiment index rose to 81.4 in December, from 77.1 in November and the seven-year low of 69.5 in October.
The improvement represents the largest two-month gain since January 2015, though sentiment is still some way short of the 17-year-high of 110.4 reached in early 2018.
Austin Hughes, chief economist at KBC Ireland, warned that respondents probably saw Brexit risks as reduced rather than gone entirely, but said the improvement revealed a ""small but potentially significant change in the mood of Irish consumers"".
""The outperformance of UK and Irish consumer confidence measures in late 2019 suggests a key local concern has eased, at least for now,"" he said.
""The question is whether that relief will prove sufficient to spark a material step-up in spending on either side of the Irish Sea in early 2020.""
On Monday, a Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey of Irish services firms rose for the second month in succession, expanding at the fastest pace since the middle of last year."

LONDON (Reuters) - Optimism at major British companies has improved by the largest margin in at least 11 years after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a sweeping election victory last month, according to a survey from accountants Deloitte.
Some 53% of chief financial officers at large businesses said their optimism about the financial outlook had improved compared with three months ago, versus 9% in the last survey conducted in October.
This was the highest proportion since the quarterly survey began 11 years ago, Deloitte said.
The figures are the strongest sign yet that a rebound in business sentiment may be underway, after more tentative evidence from a survey of purchasing managers on Monday.
Britain's economy slowed to a crawl late last year, with the most recent official growth data showing the joint-weakest annual expansion since 2012.
""The fog of uncertainty that has lingered over the UK since the 2016 EU referendum is lifting. CFOs ... are beginning 2020 with sentiment levels that would have been unimaginable at any time in the last three years,"" Deloitte chief economist Ian Stewart said.
During the election campaign, Johnson said weak business investment in 2019 was due to parliament's prevarication over approving a Brexit deal, and predicted a rebound if he gained a strong majority in parliament.
Many businesses were also concerned by the opposition Labour Party's plans to nationalize rail operators, utilities and broadband infrastructure.
Just over half of chief financial officers said they expected revenues to rise over the next year, up from 18% three months ago, and 38% said they planned to invest more, the highest proportion in four years.
Deloitte conducted the survey between Dec. 16 and Jan. 6, and spoke to 119 chief financial officers of British listed companies, large private firms and British subsidiaries of big foreign companies. The 94 listed companies accounted for just over a quarter of the British stock market, by value.
Brexit has dropped to third in CFOs' list of worries from the top spot three months ago, despite uncertainty over whether Johnson will be able to negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal in the narrow 11-month window he has set himself.
Some two thirds of CFOs said they expected Brexit to damage the business conditions, down from more than four fifths earlier in 2019.
Weak domestic demand was the biggest risk, according to CFOs, though it was less of a worry than three months earlier."

While finding qualified workers remains the most-pressing issue for small-business owners, the share unable to fill job openings dropped to the lowest level since May 2018. The share has declined since matching a record in July.
Amid the lowest unemployment rate in a half century and the smallest pool of available workers in decades, companies have said finding -- and hiring -- qualified applicants has been difficult. While compensation plans eased last month, the share of small firms indicating they expect to boost worker pay remained close to the largest since 1989.
The overall job openings index fell 5 percentage points in December to 33% but differed across sectors. For instance, 61% of construction companies reported open positions, while a similar share cited few or no qualified applicants.
“The inability to assemble work teams is a key contributor to the comparably lackluster performance of the construction industry as evidenced by the December figures,” Bill Dunkelberg, NFIB’s chief economist, said in a statement. “Owners are raising compensation in order to attract more qualified applicants to fill open positions.”"

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, but the labor market appears to be cooling, with the number of Americans on unemployment rolls surging to more than a 1-1/2-year high at the end of 2019.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Jan. 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The fourth straight weekly decline saw claims almost unwinding the jump in early December, which was blamed on a later-than-normal Thanksgiving Day.
""Jobless claims have returned to normal levels, showing the labor market is in a good place,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 220,000 in the latest week. The claims data was volatile in late 2019, with applications dropping to 203,000 at the end of November and shooting up to 252,000 in early December. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,500 to 224,000 last week.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as politics dominated sentiment. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the main indexes hitting record highs after the United States and Iran moved away from an all-out conflict.
The dollar (DXY) gained versus a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. But the labor market could be losing momentum. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid vaulted by 75,000 to 1.80 million for the week ended Dec. 28, the highest level since April 2018. The weekly increase was the largest since November 2015. 
The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 33,000 to 1.74 million. Some of the surge in continuing claims could be related to year-end volatility. 
""The continuing claims data also may exhibit some volatility around the holiday season, but the trend in the data appears to have weakened over the past month or so,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
PAYROLLS IN FOCUS
Labor market strength is helping to keep the economy on a moderate growth pace despite a deepening downturn in manufacturing. The White House's 18-month trade war with China has sapped business confidence and undercut capital expenditure.
Though Washington and Beijing in December hammered out a ""Phase 1"" trade deal, considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement, which is expected to be signed next week. 
The U.S. government is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs in December. While that would be a step down from November's robust gain of 266,000, the anticipated pace would still be well above the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population.
The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged near a 50-year low of 3.5%. The Federal Reserve last month signaled interest rates could remain unchanged at least through this year. The Fed lowered borrowing costs three times in 2019. 
Minutes of the U.S. central bank's Dec. 10-11 policy meeting published last week showed officials ""generally expected sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions,"" though some viewed next month's expected downgrade to employment growth as an indication the labor market was cooling.
The government last August estimated the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade. That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The revised payrolls data will be published on Feb. 7.

""It is not clear what the data since then will look like, but we suspect more recent job growth could be revised down,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.

“Lower inflation in December was again mainly explained by non-core prices that should be close to the bottom and are likely to increase and are a risk. Results also showed core inflation extended its moderate downtrend, in line with central bank forecasts that anticipate core inflation will continue falling in 2020. Results were not enough to ease concerns about resilient services prices despite weak domestic demand and increasing economic slack and suggest policy makers are likely to continue cutting rates but keep a cautious tone.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose more than expected in November, registering its biggest monthly increase in a year and a half, though declining exports made for mixed signals on Europe's largest economy.
Industrial production jumped by 1.1% from October, beating expectations for a 0.7% gain, figures from the statistics office showed on Thursday, thanks to manufacturing growth and booming construction.
The October reading was revised upwards to a 1% decline from a previously reported 1.7% decrease.
""That's two pieces of good news for the price of one,"" said LBBW analyst Jens-Oliver Niklasch, adding that the data should help to dispel any remaining fears of a recession, though the outlook for industrial companies remains clouded.
Germany's export-dependent manufacturers are contending with sluggish demand from abroad as well as business uncertainty linked to trade disputes and Britain's decision to leave the European Union. The automobile sector is also struggling to adjust to stricter emissions regulation and a shift to electric vehicles.
Trade figures also published on Thursday underlined the difficult outlook, with data from the statistics office showing November's exports were down 2.3% month on month while imports edged down 0.5%, narrowing the trade surplus to 18.3 billion euros ($20.3 billion).
HEADWINDS
The DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce, which expects exports to shrink this year for the first time since the world financial crisis more than a decade ago, pointed to persistent headwinds from abroad.
""Global uncertainties will remain in 2020 due to trade conflicts, sanctions or Brexit,"" said DIHK economist Volker Treier.
The recent military escalation between the United States and Iran poses an additional risk.
""The escalation in the region means another factor of uncertainty for companies,"" said Holger Bingmann, head of the BGA trade association.
Data released on Wednesday showed that industrial orders fell unexpectedly in November on weak foreign demand and a lack of big contracts, suggesting that the manufacturing slump will continue to curtail growth.
""All in all, consumption and construction should have kept the entire economy out of recession territory once again in the fourth quarter, but the former growth engine, manufacturing, is still stuttering,"" said ING analyst Carsten Brzeski.
The Ifo Institute economic research body last month said that domestic demand was likely to have helped the economy to grow by 0.2% in the fourth quarter after a 0.1% expansion in the previous three months.
The statistics office is scheduled to release preliminary data on 2019 gross domestic product on Jan. 15.
The German economy is widely expected to have expanded by 0.5% last year, down from 1.5% in 2018.

The fourth straight drop in filings, the longest streak since April, underscores signs of strength in the labor market. Companies may be less likely to let employees go amid an elevated level of job openings and difficulty hiring talented and experienced staff.
While the latest figures show that the labor market remains healthy, filings have been somewhat higher in recent months after falling to the lowest level since 1969 in April.
The data come a day before the December jobs report, which is forecast to show payrolls rose by 165,000 as the unemployment rate held at a half-century low of 3.5%. Federal Reserve officials have consistently called the labor market strong.

Vegetable oil prices were up strongly, with the index rising 9.4% to 164.7 points in December. Palm oil prices rose for the fifth month in a row, lifted by biodiesel demand, while soy, sunflower and rapeseed oil values also increased.

The sugar price index was up 4.8% to 190.3 points, lifted by surging demand for ethanol caused by rising crude oil prices.

By contrast meat prices were almost unchanged from November with the meat price index at 191.6 points with higher pig and sheep meat prices balanced by falling beef prices.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese households' confidence in the economy worsened to a five-year low in the three months to December, a central bank survey showed on Thursday, adding to a recent slew of gloomy signs for the fragile recovery.
The ratio of households who expect prices to rise a year from now also slid to a more than two-year low, underscoring the challenge the Bank of Japan faces in firing up inflation to its elusive 2% target.
A diffusion index measuring households' confidence in the economy stood at minus 29.8 in December, the worst reading since the corresponding month of 2014, the quarterly survey showed.
The survey, conducted for about a month to Dec. 3 on 4,000 households, also showed that 32.9% of respondents cut back on spending after a sales tax hike in October.
Households curbed spending on dining out, clothing and daily necessities after the tax increase, the survey showed, highlighting the toll that the higher levy was taking on private consumption.
Asked how prices were moving when excluding the impact of the sales tax hike, 64.5% said prices rose from a year ago, down from 70.5% in the previous survey.
Of the total, 73.3% expect prices to rise a year from now, down from 79.8% three months ago and the lowest level since September 2017, the survey showed.
Japan's economic growth ground to a near halt in July-September and is likely to have contracted in the final quarter of last year as the U.S.-China trade war knocked exports.
The BOJ is likely to revise up slightly its economic forecast for the fiscal year starting in April to reflect an expected boost from the government's $122 billion spending package, sources have told Reuters.
But many analysts expect inflation to remain subdued as slow wage growth keep households from loosening their purse strings.

Annual core consumer inflation stood at 0.5% in November, remaining distant from the BOJ's 2% target.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>","China's December consumer inflation still high, not seen hindering PBOC easing","By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's consumer inflation steadied while factory-gate prices fell at a slower pace in December, giving Beijing room to stay the course on monetary easing as economic growth cools.
Some investors have worried that consumer inflation, hovering near eight-year highs, could make China's central bank more cautious about further stimulus.
China's consumer prices in December rose 4.5% from a year earlier, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Thursday, unchanged from November's pace, but lower than analysts' forecast of 4.7%. The gains were again fueled by a surge in pork prices as African swine fever ravaged the country's hog herds.
However, core inflation - which excludes food and energy prices - stayed largely subdued.
Analysts expect consumer inflation may stay elevated for sometime due to higher food prices during the Lunar New Year and as global oil costs spike amid recent geopolitical tensions.
""We forecast CPI will surge above 5% in January but the inflation will see a significant fall in the second half of this year due to increasing pork supply,"" said Niu Li, economist with the State Information Center.
In contrast, the producer price index (PPI), seen as a key indicator of corporate profitability, fell 0.5% from a year earlier, data showed. Analysts had expected factory-gate prices to fall 0.4% year-on-year, compared with a 1.4% drop in November.
The slower pace of decline in producer prices was in line with improving price components in recent factory surveys. Milder price deflation was partly supported by a recovery in petroleum, coal and other fuel processing industries, the NBS said in a statement.
However, most China watchers attributed December's milder price fall to year-earlier base effects and an increase in energy prices, noting manufacturing activity remains subdued.
""The easing of deflationary pressure on the industrial sector does not mean a significant improvement in industrial production. But with a thaw of Sino-U.S. trade frictions and macro policy supports, we may see PPI turn positive in Q2, 2020,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications.
For the whole of 2019, PPI was down 0.3% compared with a rise of 3.5% the previous year.
China plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6% in 2020, relying on increased state infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown, policy sources said. Growth has cooled from 6.8% in 2017 to 6% in the third quarter of 2019, the slowest since the early 1990s.
CPI STAYS ELEVATED
December consumer inflation was still driven largely by a continued surge in pork prices.
Pork prices jumped 97% year-on-year in December, data showed, accounting for 2.34 percentage points of the CPI increase. That compared with a 110.2% jump in November.
Pork is in high demand as China prepares to celebrate the Lunar New Year starting on Jan. 25. But analysts believe pork price inflation may be close to a peak as recent policies to stabilize production and support the recovery of the pig herd have begun to show results.
Core CPI for December grew 1.4% on-year, the same pace as the preceding month. For the full-year, China's CPI grew 2.9%, within Beijing's target of around 3% for the year but higher than 2018's 2.1% gain.
China plans to keep its inflation target at around 3% in 2020, unchanged from last year, Reuters reported citing sources, confounding speculation it might raise the bar to give it room for extra economic stimulus.
""CPI will not be a constraint on monetary policy. The policy easing will continue at a pace set by the central government,"" said Gao Ming, analyst with China Merchants Securities.
On Jan. 1, the People's Bank of China announced it was cutting the amount of cash that all banks must hold as reserves, the eighth time since early 2018 to free up more funds to shore up the slowing economy.
Economists at Nomura also expect another 50 basis point cut in banks' reserve requirement ratio in Q2 when inflation pressure eases, given strong growth headwinds, especially from the cooling property sector and a worsening fiscal situation."
1508,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>",China’s Steadying Inflation Leaves Door Open for Monetary Easing,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s consumer inflation steadied in December while factory price declines moderated, leaving room for monetary easing to cement a recent stabilization in economic growth.
The consumer price index rose 4.5% last month from a year earlier, matching November’s rate and halting the recent acceleration fueled by surging pork prices. The producer price index declined 0.5% from a year earlier versus a 1.4% drop in November.
While pork prices -- a key element in the country’s CPI basket -- rose 97% from a year ago, that was actually slower than increases seen in October and November. They fell 5.6% in December from November.
Rising food demand during the Lunar New Year holidays is set to fuel price increases in January, but beyond that price pressures may moderate. That gives the central bank room for additional stimulus if needed after it started the year by trimming the amount of cash that lenders must hold in reserve and signaled continued action in 2020 to reduce borrowing costs for companies.
“The PBOC is likely to continue to use interest rate and liquidity tools to loosen monetary conditions in 2020, though the easing will probably be less pronounced than last year,” David Qu, a China economist at Bloomberg Economics in Hong Kong, wrote in a note. “We expect the PBOC to stick to a stance of measured easing to counter the economic slowdown.”
For the year, consumer inflation for 2019 stood at 2.9%, in line with the government-set target of 3%, while producer prices declined 0.3%. Core inflation, which removes the more volatile food and energy prices, stabilized at 1.4% in December, signaling ongoing weakness in the broader economy.
China’s economy has shown signs of recovery in recent months as global demand steadies and trade tensions ease. As commodity prices rise and factories start restocking, PPI deflation is set to continue to moderate and some see it turning positive as soon as January.
But measuring the economy’s momentum will be especially tricky in coming months. The week-long lunar new year holiday starts from Jan. 24, earlier than most years in the past century, creating a “noticeable distortion” to monthly economic indicators, according to economists at China International Capital Corp. including Eva Yi."

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers cut back on spending in late 2019, rounding off the worst year since at least the mid-1990s for retail sales as measured by an industry group which blamed uncertainty about Brexit and last month's election for the slump.
However, another survey suggested Britons turned more confident after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's emphatic election victory on Dec. 12.
Total retail spending fell by an annual 0.9% in November and December combined, the British Retail Consortium said, lumping the two months together to smooth out volatility caused by changes in the dates of Black Friday between 2018 and 2019.
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said last year was the first since the group began its records in 1995 to show a full-year fall in sales - down by 0.1% - as two missed Brexit deadlines and the election weighed on consumer confidence.
""Looking forward, the public's confidence in Britain's trade negotiations will have a big impact on spending over the coming year,"" Dickinson said.
Johnson has said he will strike a new trade deal with the European Union before the end of this year and avoid the economic hit of tariffs and other trade barriers when a no-change transition period ends on Dec. 31.
The BRC said like-for-like sales - which strip out changes in retail floor space from one year to the next - fell by an annual 1.2% in the combined November-December period.
Payment card company Barclaycard also sounded downbeat about broader consumer spending which has helped Britain's economy to cope with the hit from lower investment by businesses since the Brexit referendum result of 2016.
Barclaycard said spending rose by an annual 1.0% in December - lower than growth of around 1.5% in the autumn - with supermarkets showing a fall of 0.9%.
But cinema sales were up 19%, helped by the release of the latest Star Wars and Frozen films. Spending in pubs and on takeaway food rose by about 12%.
Thursday's weak surveys chimed with official data which showed the slowest retail sales growth since April 2018 in November. Industry data this week showed the lowest sales growth over Christmas for supermarkets for five years.
However, a survey commissioned by Barclaycard showed that after the Dec. 12 election, 41% of consumers expressed confidence in Britain's economy, up 10 percentage points from November to the highest level since March 2017.
At the same time, only one in five planned to buy a big-ticket item during 2020.
The survey was conducted between Dec. 17 and Dec. 19 by Longitude Research and included responses from 2,000 people."
1510,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 10:46AM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls post largest gain in eight months,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased by the most in eight months in December, pointing to sustained labor market strength though job gains last month were likely flattered by a seasonal quirk.
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls jumped by 202,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since April, after an upwardly revised 124,000 rise in November. Private job growth averaged 163,000 jobs per month in 2019, slowing from an average increase of 219,000 in 2018. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 160,000 last month following a previously reported 67,000 rise in November.
ADP private payrolls tend to surge in December because of adjustment difficulties related to the purging of employees who have permanently left company payrolls. According economists, some companies keep workers who have resigned on their payrolls until they file year-end tax documents. In contrast, in the government's more-comprehensive employment report, workers who are no longer getting paid are dropped from the data.
""The accuracy of the ADP's first estimate of monthly employment growth has never been anywhere near as good as we would have expected given the richness of the data source,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""Nevertheless, this latest ADP reading supports our view that employment and GDP growth held up surprisingly well in the fourth quarter, even though some of the survey evidence weakened further.""
The dollar was trading marginally higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose in part as Iran appeared to signal that overnight missile strikes ""concluded"" its retaliation for the U.S. killing of General Qassem Soleimani.
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the Labor Department's employment report for December scheduled for release on Friday. Even discounting the December distortions, the ADP report generally has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report because of the differences in methodology. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 164,000 jobs last month after surging 266,000 in November. The unemployment rate is forecast steady near a 50-year low of 3.5%.
""The ADP data also were much weaker than the government data in November so, the strength in the December ADP report may be payback for the softness in November that may not show up in the government data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The ADP report showed employment in the goods-producing sector increased by 29,000 jobs in December. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 7,000 jobs last month and construction added 37,000 positions, likely boosted by unseasonably mild weather. Natural resources and mining shed 1,000 jobs.

The services sector added 173,000 jobs last month, with gains concentrated in health services, professional and business services, and trade, transportation and utilities. The leisure and hospitality industry shed 21,000 jobs.

Economists had expected the report to show a gain of 160,000 jobs.
November's figure was revised to 124,000 from the 67,000 initially reported.
“As 2019 came to a close, we saw expanded payrolls in December,” said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. “The service providers posted the largest gain since April,driven mainly by professional and business services. Job creation was strong across companies of all sizes, led predominantly by midsized companies.”
Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said, “Looking through the monthly vagaries of the data, job gains continue to moderate. Manufacturers, energy producers and small companies have been shedding jobs. Unemployment is low, but will begin to rise if job growth slows much further.”
The ADP numbers come ahead of the Labor Department's nonfarm payrolls report for December on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.

After contracting in the previous four quarters, output per hour worked rose by 0.1% in the third quarter compared with the same period of 2018, the Office for National Statistics said.
Growth in productivity is key to the long-term prospects for growth and prosperity of an economy.
""Although productivity grew on the year, the underlying picture is of sustained weakness since 2008, with growth over the past year being only a third of the average over the last 10 years or so,"" ONS statistician Katherine Kent said.
Over the last decade, annual growth in productivity has yet to even touch its pre-financial crisis average between 1972 and 2008. (Graphic: UK productivity growth yet to touch pre-crisis average click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/650/646/prod1.png) 
Johnson and his finance minister Sajid Javid are planning a big increase in infrastructure investment to tackle Britain's weak productivity record which lags behind those of other countries such as Germany and France.
Responding to the latest data, Javid said low productivity had held back Britain for too long and that he planned to address this in his March 11 budget. 
""The government's spending ambitions for our broadband and transport networks offer some hope for uplift down the line,"" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said.
""But long-term capital investments must not displace efforts to jump-start improvements to our business environment today,"" he said, calling for more incentives to small companies to invest, less red tape and more access to training.
The ONS also said unit labour costs rose by 3.6% in annual terms in the third quarter, back to a level last hit at the end of 2018, as wages rose faster than gains in productivity.

Economists link the recent weakness in productivity growth in Britain to the surge in hiring by many employers who opted to take on staff rather than make longer-term commitments to investment in the face of uncertainty over Brexit.

1513,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>",Europe’s Factories Headed Into 2020 With Less Hope for Jobs,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s manufacturers headed into the new year on a downbeat note, with expectations for both export orders and employment weakening at the end of a rough 2019.
The latest sentiment figures from the European Commission came just hours after Germany reported an unexpected drop in manufacturing orders. That’s a volatile figure, but it adds to signs that Europe’s largest economy is still struggling to overcome its worst industrial downturn in a decade.
The decline in factory employment expectations is a worrying development if it persists.
Manufacturing, particularly in Germany, is struggling to exit a more than year old slump as it deals with uncertainties including the U.S.-China trade war and the U.K.’s planned exit from the European Union. The bigger risk for the economy is that -- as the Bundesbank predicts -- the industrial weakness will bleed into the wider economy through 2020.
The commission’s headline confidence index rose slightly in December to 101.5 from 101.2, led by services, where firms grew more optimistic about the near-term outlook. Manufacturing sentiment declined slightly.
“Things look pretty decent for the European consumer,” John Roe of Legal & General Investment Management said on Bloomberg TV. “It all comes over to do you get this spillover into services. If it stays in the manufacturing side, it’s not enough to derail the European economy.”
The German data earlier on Wednesday showed orders slumped 1.3% in November, the biggest decline since July and defying estimates for a 0.2% gain. The drop was primarily driven by bulk orders and lower overseas demand for investment goods, while consumer products stagnated.
In one bright spot, a previous decline for October was revised to a slight gain, resulting in an overall improvement in the two months through November compared with August and September.
“Incoming orders have stabilized at a low level in recent months,” the economy ministry said in a statement. “The outlook for industrial activity has improved somewhat.”
A separate report on Monday showed that German car production -- a bedrock of the economy -- was particularly hard hit last year by waning exports. Vehicle output fell to its lowest in almost a quarter of a century, according to the VDA car lobby.
The Bundesbank says Germany’s economy probably stagnated in the fourth quarter, and growth is set to remain below 1% this year. The euro-areas expansion is forecast by economists to cool for a third straight year in 2020, to 1%.

The Commission's monthly survey showed economic sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to 101.5 points in December from 101.2 in November, a second consecutive monthly rise and above the average forecast of 101.4 points in a Reuters poll of economists.
The improved sentiment was driven by higher confidence in services, the biggest economic sector in the bloc, and in construction.
Sentiment in industry slightly fell despite factory managers expecting their selling prices to rise. The mood among consumers worsened markedly, as households predicted worsening economic conditions.
Among the bloc's largest economies, the indicator improved markedly in Italy, where it rebounded above the long-term average after a minor slip in November.
The euro zone's third economy recorded an improved mood in all the monitored economic sectors with a jump in optimism among shop owners in coincidence with the Christmas sales season.
The overall indicator rose significantly also in Spain, and edged up in Germany, the euro zone's largest economy. There, the mood among manufacturers battered by global trade wars recorded a new seven-year low but was compensated by surging confidence in services.
The overall economic mood went slightly down in France, because of lower optimism among consumers."
1515,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 05:24AM ET</span>",Riksbank Signals It Won’t Raise Rates Again for a Very Long Time,"(Bloomberg) -- Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves signaled that the bank’s decision to raise its main rate to zero last month won’t be followed by more tightening for a very long time.
According to minutes of the bank’s December meeting, Ingves said he’s even willing to let inflation exceed the bank’s target for a while. That said, he also defended the decision to move to zero after half a decade of negative rates, arguing the current policy provides a better “vantage point.”
The governor said that even if the Swedish economy turns out better and inflation picks up “faster than is assumed in our forecasts,” he would be “in no hurry to raise the repo rate,” according to the minutes published on Wednesday.
“The inflation rate can overshoot the target for a period of time, especially given that inflation has in historical terms more often been under than over the target,” he said. “It is more important that we do not overestimate our capacity for ‘fine tuning.’”
But “the situation is not uncomplicated,” Ingves said. The global economic outlook remains challenging and Swedish economic growth in the third quarter was slower than the Riksbank expected.
Against that backdrop, Ingves said the Riksbank can turn to its quantitative easing program for a flexible response to shifts in the economy.
“Our presence on the bond market gives us an opportunity to quickly raise or lower the rate of purchase if there is need to change our monetary policy,” he said. “In other words, we have a good starting point if we should need to adjust the composition and direction of our monetary policy.”
According to Claes Mahlen, head of trading strategy at Handelsbanken, Ingves seems to prefer more QE. “The threshold to change policy, in either direction, is high we think,” Mahlen said.
Sweden’s central bank has made clear it was determined to end a policy of negative interest rates, bringing relief to its finance industry and providing a test case for counterparts around the world experimenting with subzero borrowing costs.
But the Riksbank, once castigated by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman for what he called a “sadomonetarist” policy of tightening, now faces renewed controversy as it removes some stimulus despite evidence of a slowing economy. Deputy Governors Anna Breman and Per Jansson entered reservations against the latest rate decision.
“There is a risk that a rate rise at present would halt an economic upswing before it had managed to take hold,” Breman said, according to the minutes.
Economists pointed to a perceived dovish shift in the tone of the minutes.
“Seems that the opposition to return to negative rates, if need be, is a little less than commonly perceived,” Mahlen said.
“The Riksbank Hawk-o-Meter turned from completely neutral for the October minutes -- not capturing the clear signals of a December hike -- to mildly dovish for the December minutes, despite the policy rate path pointing to unchanged rates,” NordeaMacroLab said in a tweet.

The INSEE statistics agency said that its monthly consumer confidence index fell for the first time since December 2018 when France was mired in anti-government ""yellow vest"" protests against the high cost of living and general elitism.
The index fell to 102 - the lowest since July - from 105 in November, which was revised down from 106 previously. The December outcome fell short of economists' average forecast for 104 in a Reuters poll.
""Protests against the government pensions reform are likely to have played a role, and may weigh on economic activity going forward,"" said HSBC economist Olivier Vigna in a research note.
The drop offers the first picture of consumer morale since unions launched strikes on Dec. 5 aimed at forcing the government to ditch plans to set up a points-based pension scheme in the biggest overhaul of the system since World War II.
Though participation has waned, the strike is now the longest since 1968 and remains a major headache for commuters trying to get to work and consumers wanting to go shopping.
Consumers reported in INSEE's monthly poll that their outlook for the general economic situation and their own personal finances over the next year was the lowest since April.
Many retail shops, cafes and hotels have reported a sharp drop in business during the crunch holiday period, a time when many make a large chunk of their annual income.
It is all the more painful for them as it is the second weak holiday period in a row after business suffered at the end of 2018 due to the waves violent street protests last year that kept many shoppers at home."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial orders fell unexpectedly in November on weak foreign demand and a lack of major contracts, data showed on Wednesday, suggesting that a manufacturing slump will continue to hamper overall growth in Europe's largest economy.
Germany's export-dependent manufacturers are struggling with sluggish demand from abroad as well as business uncertainty linked to trade disputes and Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
""The misery in manufacturing continues,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, noting that the military escalation between the United States and Iran was now posing an additional risk for businesses.
Contracts for 'Made in Germany' goods decreased by 1.3% from the previous month, posting the steepest drop since July, data from the Economy Ministry showed. That confounded the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.3% rise.
Demand from other countries fell 3.1%, the biggest drop since February, whereas orders from domestic clients rose 1.6%. The reading for October was revised up to a rise of 0.2% from a previously reported fall of 0.4%.
Without bulk orders, industrial orders rose 1.0% in November, the economy ministry said, adding that the sector's incoming orders had stabilized at a low level in recent months.
""At the same time, business expectations in manufacturing have brightened somewhat. So the outlook for industrial activity has improved a bit,"" the ministry said.
German business morale hit a six-month high in December, a survey by the Ifo institute showed last month, suggesting that the German economy picked up in the fourth quarter despite the manufacturing crisis.
The German economy probably grew 0.5% in 2019, down from 1.5% in 2018. The statistics office releases preliminary gross domestic product growth data on Jan. 15.

For 2020, the government forecasts 1.0% growth, helped by a higher number of working days. On a calendar-adjusted basis, Berlin predicts 0.6% growth this year.

Japan's economy has suffered in recent months from soft global demand and a slide in consumer spending, after the government raised sales tax to 10% from 8% in October.
Labour ministry data showed real wages, a gauge of household purchasing power, fell 0.9% in November from November a year ago, their fastest decline since July. They also were revised down to a 0.4% contraction in October.
Nominal total cash earnings fell 0.2% in November from a year earlier, their first decline in three months. Their 0.5% gains in October were revised down to no change.
""The fall in real wages was larger in November due to the impact from a rise in the consumer price index,"" a labor ministry official told Reuters, adding that fresh food prices increased.
One-off special payments slumped 3.9% in November after a revised 8.5% drop in October. Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings and determines a wage trend - inched up 0.1%, according to the data.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, declined 1.9% in November from a year earlier, after it was revised down to a 0.1% fall in October. Those figures particularly show reduced overtime hours among manufacturers, the official said.
Revelations last year that labor ministry officials used faulty polling methods, which forced revisions, cast doubt on the accuracy of the ministry's wage data from 2004 to 2017. The flaw has made it harder to gauge the actual wage trend.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who are employed for more than one month at a firm that employs more than five people, or 2) those who are employed on a daily basis or have less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted at a firm that employs more than five people.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell to a more than three-year low in November as imports declined further, weighed down by the Trump administration's trade war with China, and exports rebounded, suggesting solid economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The strength in the economy at the tail end of 2019 was underscored by other data on Tuesday showing activity in the vast services sector picking up in December. Though growth in the fourth quarter will likely be flattered by the plunge in imports, it will probably remain supportive of the Federal Reserve's description of the economy as being in a ""good place.""
The U.S. central bank last month signaled interest rates could remain unchanged at least through this year, after lowering borrowing costs three times in 2019. The economy is holding up despite a deepening downturn in manufacturing. Fears of a recession that dominated last summer have sharply receded.
""The economy may be pulling out of a rough patch,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The Commerce Department said the trade deficit decreased 8.2% to $43.1 billion in November, the smallest since October 2016. The trade gap narrowed 0.7% through November and is on track to record its first annual decline since 2013. Though the shrinking trade bill should be a boost to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, falling consumer and capital goods imports also suggest a cooling in domestic demand. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall tightening to $43.8 billion in November. The goods trade deficit with China, the focus of the White House's ""America First"" agenda tumbled 15.7% to $26.4 billion, with imports dropping 9.2% and exports jumping 13.7%. The goods trade deficit with the European Union fell 20.2% to $13.1 billion.
The United States and China are embroiled in a bruising trade war, and the White House has also tussled with other trading partners, including the European Union, Brazil and Argentina, accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of U.S. manufacturers. 
Though Washington and Beijing in December hammered out a ""Phase 1"" trade deal, considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement. President Donald Trump said last Tuesday that the partial deal would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House.
The 18-month-long U.S.-China trade war has undermined business investment, which together with slowing growth overseas have led to a recession in manufacturing. Economists expect manufacturing to continue to struggle without a complete rolling back of tariffs. Manufacturing's troubles do not appear to have significantly spilled over to the services industries.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index rose to a reading of 55.0 last month from 53.9 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
But services industries reported a moderation in growth in new orders and hiring. The report came on the heels of a survey from the ISM last week showing its measure of national factory activity dropping in December to its lowest level since June 2009, and contracting for a fifth straight month. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were steady, while stocks on Wall Street fell.
GROWTH BOOST
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $3.7 billion to $75.3 billion in November, the smallest since March 2017. The so-called real trade deficit so far in the fourth quarter is below the average for the July-September period. 
Economists expect trade will add at least 1.5 percentage points to GDP growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters. The boost from trade is, however, expected to be partially offset by a moderation in the pace of inventory accumulation.
The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 2.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter.
In November, goods imports dropped 1.4% to $201.1 billion, declining for a third straight month. Consumer goods imports fell $1.0 billion, pulled down by declines in cellphones and other household items, and artwork and other collectibles.
Economists believe consumer goods imports were depressed by a 15% tariff on $110 billion worth of Chinese goods that came into effect on Sept. 1. They also say anticipation that the ""Phase 1"" trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports. A rebound in imports is expected.
""If, as we expect, the recent decline in imports is due to importers pulling forward demand to get ahead of consumer-focused tariffs, it may be set to reverse and be a drag on GDP in coming quarters,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
The drop in consumer goods imports points to a slower pace of consumer spending in the October-December quarter after two straight quarters of brisk growth. Capital goods imports dropped $1.2 billion in November, reflecting decreases in civilian aircraft and computers, and suggesting continued weakness in business investment.
Crude oil imports tumbled to 166.4 million barrels, the lowest since February 1992, from 188.3 million barrels in October. That contributed to a record petroleum surplus. 

Goods exports rose 0.7% to $137.2 billion in November. They were boosted by a $0.6 billion increase in shipments of capital goods. Consumer goods exports advanced $0.5 billion.

1520,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 10:43AM ET</span>",ISM Non-Manufacturing Index Shows Strength,"Investing.com - The ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Index registered growth in December, with the Composite Index coming in at 55.0 Tuesday, a four-month high, versus the expected 54.5 and 53.9 the previous month. 
The index is released during the first week of the year and has become a key judge of the strength of the U.S. economy. The service sector has become a major driver of growth in recent months given the slowdown in the manufacturing sector amid the trade war with China.
The index is calculated such that a reading over 50 indicates expansion while a number below 50 contraction. The ISM Manufacturing PMI, released on Friday, came in at 47.2, the lowest reading since June 2009.
Another indication of the slowdown in the manufacturing sector came from the month-on-month U.S. factory orders figure for November. This showed a decline of 0.7%, compared with October figure of +0.3%."

The headline figure slightly beat economist expectations for a C$1.2 billion trade deficit, but the gap only narrowed because October’s numbers were revised to a C$1.6 billion deficit from an originally reported C$1.1 billion deficit.
The soft trade report follows a series of weak economic data releases over the past couple weeks, potentially putting pressure on the Bank to Canada to consider an interest rate cut in the first half of 2020.

1523,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 08:14AM ET</span>",India Sees Slowest Growth Since 2013 on Weak Consumption,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s economy is on track for its slowest growth since at least 2013, weighed down by a shadow banking crisis, weak investment and a slump in spending.
Gross domestic product will grow 5% in the year through March 2020, the Statistics Ministry said in a statement in New Delhi on Tuesday. That is in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 22 economists and compares with 6.8% expansion in the previous year.
That pace will place India, which was the world’s fastest-growing major economy last year, behind regional peers like China, Vietnam and the Philippines, all of which are seen expanding close to 6% or more.
To boost growth, the central bank cut interest rates five times last year and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government lowered taxes for companies.
But there’s been little sign of a revival in investment or a pick-up in consumer demand. The Reserve Bank of India last month reduced its own full-year growth estimate to 5%, which will be the slowest pace since the year ended March 2013, after the methodology for calculating national output was changed.
There are no surprises, said Madhavi Arora, an economist at Edelweiss Securities in Mumbai. She sees improvement in the remaining two quarters, with the global manufacturing picture showing improvement and base effect seen helping growth numbers.
The International Monetary Fund is separately set to lower India’s growth forecast this month, after previously forecasting 6.1% expansion. Poor business sentiment and declining rural consumption are among reasons for weakness in the economy, the IMF’s Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said last month.
The slump in consumption, which makes up about 60% of GDP, can be attributed in part to a crisis among shadow lenders and a build-up of bad loans at banks, which in turn curbed lending in the economy. Waning consumer confidence amid unemployment at a more than four-decade high also hurt activity.
With the room for more central bank stimulus closing as inflation quickens, the focus shifts to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s annual budget, scheduled for Feb. 1.

That was down from 5.5% a year ago as the European Union's fastest growing economy approaches full employment, and from a peak of 16% in 2012 in the wake of the global financial crisis."
1525,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 06:13AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation picks in December before early 2020 fall,"BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation jumped as expected last month, offering some temporary relief for European Central Bank policymakers before price growth is expected to dip again.
Eurostat said on Tuesday that inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro currency rose to 1.3% as expected in December from 1.0% a month earlier as energy prices rebounded and the cost of food products rose. 
With inflation running well below its target of nearly 2%, the ECB has been providing unprecedented stimulus for years and weak economic growth has increased the risk that even more central bank help will be needed before price pressures build.
Prices excluding food and energy costs, an underlying gauge closely watched by the ECB's policymakers, held steady at 1.4% last month while an even narrower gauge, which excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, was unchanged at 1.3%.
Adding to the relatively positive data, Eurostat said that retail trade, an indicator of household demand, was much stronger than expected in November, rebounding from two consecutive monthly falls to a 1.0% monthly rise. 
The relief for the ECB may be short lived, however, as leading indicators point to weak growth ahead with no significant rebound in sight, particularly for Germany's vast industrial sector. 
Inflation is also likely to dip back towards 1% in the first half of the year before rising again, ending 2020 broadly where it started. 
Geopolitical tensions, which have pushed oil prices higher in recent days, could lift price growth but uncertainty could cut into economic activity, negating the effect of higher oil prices, analysts say. 
But even if inflation slows, the ECB is unlikely to take policy action any time soon as the bank has exhausted much of its firepower and its September stimulus package will provide accommodation for months to come. 
The bank is also about to launch a broader review of its policy strategy and no major shift is likely before the review concludes at the end of the year.

The ECB will next meet on Jan. 23, when it is expected to launch its policy review.

Tuesday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) showed total job ads slid 6.7% in December, from November when they fell 1.8%.
Job ads averaged 142,569 in December, down 18.8% from a year earlier and the lowest reading since April 2016.
""The number of job ads declined by more than we would expect for that time of the year, suggesting that the escalating bushfire crises had an impact,"" said Catherine Birch, a senior economist at ANZ.
""Based on previous major natural disasters, such as Victoria's Black Saturday fires and Queensland's 2010-11 floods, the current bushfires could see a short-term negative impact on employment.""
Fires have been sweeping across the eastern and southern coast of Australia, scorching rural towns and forcing mass evacuations.
The ANZ vacancies series is closely watched by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) given it counts actual job ads, while Australian Bureau of Statistics data is based on more tenuous intentions by firms to hire.
The RBA has cut its cash rate to a record low of 0.75% in recent months in part as a response to a rising unemployment rate.
Official data showed employment bounced by a solid 39,900 in November, after a shock drop the month before, while the jobless rate eased back to 5.2%. The December data are due on Jan. 23."

The final seasonally adjusted Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.4 in December from 50.3 in November, declining to its lowest level since September 2016.
It was below the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the second time in three months, and down from a preliminary reading of 50.6.
""Survey data for the three months to December imply that fourth quarter GDP (gross domestic product) is likely to contract,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
A sales tax increase and typhoon had weighed on business activity in October, and there was only a very limited recovery in November, Hayes said.
With growth in new work remaining subdued, companies turned their focus on outstanding orders.
Backlogs of work fell to the lowest since May 2018, the survey showed, underlining the challenge facing policymakers who are hoping domestic demand will stay strong enough to hold up economic growth.
New export business - another key activity gauge - slumped to a six-month low, suggesting the economy is likely to remain under pressure as slower global growth hurts demand.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized 1.8% in the third quarter because of stronger consumer and business spending, but analysts expect it to shrink in the quarter through December due to deepening internal and external strains.
Retail sales fell 2.1% in November as consumer sentiment stayed depressed after October's sales tax hike, which looks to have hit private consumption harder than the government thought.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, fell for the third straight month in December, seeing the fastest pace of decline since April 2014.
The index dropped to 48.6 from November's final 49.8.
""The Japanese economy has most likely entered a cyclical lull, although continued job creation and upbeat expectations provide a glimmer of hope,"" said IHS Markit's Hayes."

LONDON (Reuters) - Optimism among companies in Britain's dominant services sector surged after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's landslide election win last month, despite continued economic stagnation, a business survey showed on Monday.
The business expectations component of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) hit its highest level since September 2018, while order books increased for the first time in four months.
The overall PMI in December improved to 50.0 from a preliminary reading for the month - based on responses before the election - of 49.0. It was also higher than November's 49.3.
Still, the index has not exceeded the 50 threshold denoting growth since August - the longest run below that mark since 2009 - and survey compiler IHS Markit said its readings were consistent with no growth in the economy in the fourth quarter.
Investors are watching for early signs of the impact of Johnson's emphatic victory over the opposition Labour Party under left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn, and sterling - already on a rising trend on Monday - rose modestly after the PMI report.
""Today's release suggests that there could be a post-election bounce in the data over the next few months as confidence improves,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
""If this is confirmed in January and February then it should be enough to convince the Bank (of England) to keep rates at 0.75%.""
The upward revision to the business expectations index was the largest in the services PMI since mid-2015.
(GRAPHIC: Decisive election result cheers UK businesses - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/648/644/final%20flash.png)
Johnson's success in winning a large parliamentary majority means Britain is on course to leave the European Union on Jan. 31 and start an 11-month, no-change transition period.
But some businesses are worried that his refusal to contemplate asking for an extension to the transition, even if Britain has not sealed a new trade deal with the EU before the end of the year, risks creating another Brexit ""cliff edge.""
""I would be surprised if optimism is sustained, unless Boris Johnson extends (the) transition (or) finds ways to deepen the trade agreement,"" John Springford, deputy director at the Centre for European Reform think tank, said of the PMI.
The composite PMI, which combines the services and manufacturing output indexes, held at 49.3 in December, matching September's 38-month low, but better than the preliminary estimate of 48.5.
The final PMI for the services sector was based on responses gathered between Dec. 5 and 19, either side of the Dec. 12 election. The preliminary PMI was based on responses between Dec. 5 and 12."

IHS Markit's final euro zone composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good indicator of economic health, nudged up to 50.9 in December from November's 50.6.
That beat a preliminary estimate which suggested no change from the previous month but remained close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""Another month of subdued business activity in December rounded off the euro zone's worst quarter since 2013. The PMI data suggest the euro area will struggle to have grown by more than 0.1% in the closing three months of 2019,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
That is worse than the 0.2% growth predicted in a December Reuters poll. 
A PMI for the bloc's dominant services industry bounced to 52.8 from November's 51.9, above a preliminary reading of 52.4. But a manufacturing PMI out last week showed factory activity contracted for an 11th straight month in December.
The upturn in services meant firms were at their most optimistic about the year ahead since May. A composite future output PMI jumped to 59.4 from 57.9.
Indicating services activity may remain resilient, firms in the sector were unable to match demand last month for the first time since July. The backlogs of work index climbed to 51.0 from 49.7.

The dominant sector also recorded its first increase in new business since August, and business confidence climbed to the highest level since April.
""Despite a final flurry from the service sector in December, it's looking like stagnation at best for economic growth in the final three months of the year,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""Nothing spectacular is expected for the opening quarter of 2020, though the signs are that things might be starting to turn, with indicators for new orders and business confidence on an upward trajectory across manufacturing and services alike.""

Data compiler IHS Markit said its purchasing managers index for the services sector rose to 52.4 in December from 52.2 in November, unchanged from a preliminary reading.
The index rose further above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
However, IHS Markit's overall composite PMI index, which includes the services and manufacturing sectors, slipped to 52.0 from 52.1 in November, reflecting slower manufacturing growth.
""The French service sector ended 2019 with a slightly quicker rise in business activity. The result locked in a solid rate of output expansion for the final quarter of the year, which was supported by strong new order growth throughout,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
""Faster headline growth at service providers helped offset stuttering manufacturing production and ensured the pace of expansion in composite activity was little-changed from November.

The seasonally adjusted Markit India Services PMI index climbed to 53.3 from 52.7 in November, suggesting a strong end to the calendar year. The level was the highest since July.
A reading above 50 means expansion while anything below that signals contraction.
While the pick-up in activity signaled an uptick in business confidence, it was accompanied by a rise in inflationary pressures, the survey showed. That trend may keep monetary policy makers from resuming interest-rate cuts anytime soon.
The Reserve Bank of India slashed rates five times last year to support economic growth, but paused in December citing a surprise surge in inflation."

The IHS Markit Business Activity Index for services rose to 51.1 from 50.4 in November, just above the 51.0 consensus forecast of nine analysts polled by Reuters and well clear of the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The sub-index for new business in the services sector rose to 51.6 from 50.8.
IHS Markit's sister survey for manufacturing, published last Thursday, showed activity contracting for a 15th month running in December, and at the steepest rate for almost seven years, suggesting the euro zone's third-largest economy will continue to struggle in the near term.
Thursday's data weighed heavily on the composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) which combines services and manufacturing. It fell for a second successive month to 49.3 in December from 49.6 in November, IHS Markit said.
The government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party forecasts 2019 economic growth of just 0.1%, leaving Italy in its customary position among the euro zone's most sluggish economies.

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of services companies, which account for around half of Spain's economic output, stood at 54.9 last month, up from 53.2 in November to its highest mark since March.
The index has held above the 50 line separating growth from contraction for just over six years.
""Against the backdrop of ongoing economic and political uncertainties, the solid and accelerated rise in activity is perhaps somewhat surprising but nonetheless should ensure a solid rise in GDP in the fourth quarter of at least 0.4%,"" IHS Markit Economics Director Paul Smith said in a statement.
The solid performance of services in the Spanish private sector contrasts with the ongoing weakness shown by manufacturers.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of new cars sold in Britain last year fell to its lowest since 2013, as consumers held back from purchases amid increased restrictions on diesel vehicles and ongoing economic uncertainty in the run-up to Brexit.
Britain is Europe's second-largest market for new vehicles, and Monday's figures add to signs that households grew more cautious about their spending last year, despite low unemployment and rising wages.
New car registrations dropped by 2% in 2019 to 2.31 million, according to provisional data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the third annual fall since sales peaked at 2.69 million in 2016.
""Undoubtedly consumer confidence on big-ticket items is still very weak,"" SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.
Car buyers' reluctance to purchase diesel vehicles following Volkswagen's emissions scandal, plus planned restrictions on older diesel vehicles going into city centers, also hurt demand.
Sales in December alone were up 4% from a year earlier, when stocks of some models were limited pending new emissions tests.
Brexit remained the industry's top concern, Hawes said, due to the risk of 10% tariffs on imports and exports of cars in 2021 if Prime Minister Boris Johnson cannot negotiate a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union before then.
A tariff of this level would make a lot of car production in Britain uneconomic, and the risk of this has caused many manufacturers' investment plans to stall, he added.
""There may be some light at the end of the tunnel, but it is a dull, flickering one at best,"" he said.
Tougher environmental rules are another problem for the industry. After Brexit Britain is expected to stick to existing EU plans to fine car manufacturers whose vehicles emit more than 95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer traveled, which will take full effect in 2021.
Cars sold last year in Britain emitted 127.9 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer on average, up 2.7% from a year earlier and above the 2018 EU average of 120.4 grams, largely due to Britons' increasing preference for bigger cars.
Fewer sales of more efficient diesel cars, and a change to emission testing methods, also played a role.
Currently manufacturers can offset emissions from cars sold in Britain against those sold in other markets, such as Italy, where buyers favor smaller, more efficient vehicles. But after Brexit this is unlikely to be possible, Hawes said.
To reduce the extra cost for consumers and industry, Britain should expand subsidies for battery-powered electric cars, which made up under 2% of sales last year, he added."

The IHS Markit Egypt Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 48.2, up from 47.9 in November but staying below the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
""Companies reported further declines in both output and new orders, with panelists noting that market conditions remained subdued in general at the end of the year,"" the survey said.
Output edged up to 47.1 from 46.6, with some firms mentioning that liquidity issues restricted business activity. New orders stood at 47.9, extending a run of contraction to five months, though it was up from November's reading of 47.0.
""Despite contracting further, both output and new orders fell at softer rates than in November. This indicates that the downturn in the non-oil sector is beginning to ease,"" said David Owen, an economist at IHS Markit.
""That said, headwinds remain on the external front, with new export orders falling at the steepest rate in over three years.""
Job losses were reported at their fastest rate since May.
It remained to be seen whether lower inflation in input costs due to the strengthening of Egypt's pound against the dollar could lead to a reinvigoration of the non-oil sector, Owen said.
The Egyptian pound traded stronger than 16 pounds to the dollar in December for the first time since February 2017.
The annual headline inflation rate rose to 3.6% in November, but remained well below previous levels.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 09:11PM ET</span>",China's services sector expands at slower pace in Dec as confidence dips: Caixin PMI,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector expanded at a slower pace in December following a strong rebound in the previous month, with business confidence falling to the second lowest on record despite a pick-up in new orders, a private survey showed on Monday.
The more downbeat reading suggests services companies remain cautious about the outlook for China's economy despite a flurry of stimulus measures, signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector and a long-awaited U.S.-China trade deal.
The services sector accounts for more than half of the economy.
The Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers' index (PMI) slowed to 52.5 last month from 53.5 in November, but was still higher than an 8-month low hit in October.
The index has stayed above the 50-point margin that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis since late 2005.
The cooling trend in the private survey echoed that in
the official non-manufacturing PMI, published by the National Bureau of Statistics, which fell from November's eight-month high.
Beijing has been counting on a strong services sector to cushion a prolonged slowdown in manufacturing and investment and create jobs for workers laid-off in other areas. Economic growth has cooled to near 30-year lows amid sluggish demand at home and abroad.
""China's economy is likely to get off to a quick start in 2020, but it will still be constrained by limited demand for the rest of the year,"" Zhong Zhengsheng, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, wrote in a note accompanying the Caixin PMI release.
Services companies surveyed expressed concerns over subdued economic conditions and a lack of staff, the Caixin survey showed. Their expectations regarding the one-year outlook for business activity fell to the second-lowest level since the series began in 2005.
The pace of job creation was also more modest, with the employment sub-index hitting the lowest level since July. Meanwhile, input costs continued to rise, while firms had to lower their selling prices for the first time in over a year, squeezing companies' profit margins.
That was despite a faster rise in the volume of new work in December, suggesting some companies were cutting prices to promote sales amid fierce competition.
""It is difficult for the measure of business confidence, which remained at a relatively low level in December, to improve. That has become a major hurdle to stabilizing the economy,"" Zhong said.
While domestic demand picked up somewhat in December, new orders from overseas weakened to the worst level in six months, deteriorating notably from November.
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Monday, slowed to 52.6 in December from 53.2 in November.
While the ""Phase one"" trade deal with the United States, which is expected to be signed on Jan. 15, will ease some of the pressure on exporters by reducing U.S. tariffs, analysts at NatWest markets said a recovery in the manufacturing sector is unlikely be sustainable if further tariff escalation remains a threat.
""We expect the stronger recovery momentum in the services sector to partially offset the downside risks of the manufacturing sector outlook into 2020,"" they wrote in a note."
1538,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 08:51PM ET</span>",Japan's December factory activity contracts at faster pace as output slumps: PMI,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity shrank at a faster pace in December than in the previous month as output slumped, underscoring growing pressure on businesses from sagging demand abroad and at home.
The Jibun Bank Final Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 48.4 on a seasonally adjusted basis, matching a more than three-year low last touched in October.
It was down from a preliminary figure of 48.8 for last month and compared with November's final reading of 48.9.
""Japan's manufacturing sector has ended 2019 where it started, stuck in contraction with little hope of an imminent turnaround,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""The manufacturing economy has endured its worst performance in over three years, with momentum clearly to the downside heading into 2020.""
The PMI survey showed output fell to its lowest since March as companies faced unfavourable demand conditions, and weak new exports due to lower sales to China.
Overall new orders and output stayed in contraction for the 12th consecutive month, though the decline in new business slowed for the second straight month.
Japan's industrial output slipped for the second straight month in November, raising the likelihood the economy will contract in the fourth quarter.
The Bank of Japan last month offered a gloomier view on factory output, while keeping intact its assessment that the world's third-largest economy continues to expand moderately as a trend.
The manufacturing PMI index remained below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for an eight month, marking the longest such run since a nine-month stretch to February 2013.
""Survey data highlighted that weak demand remains an industry-wide problem, impacting output volumes and causing firms to cut their prices in hopes of turning the tide,"" IHS Markit's Hayes added."

A slowdown in manufacturing activity in the European Union's fastest-growing economy had threatened to spread to the services sector in October as seven years of uninterrupted growth weakened to a near standstill.
However, the AIB IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for services rebounded for a second successive month to 55.9 from 53.7 in November, comfortably above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The recovery was driven by stronger domestic orders. The subindex measuring business expectations, which hit an eight-year low in September, shot up to a 17-month high of 70.3 last month from 66.4 a month earlier.
""Overall this report indicates that the Irish services sector finished 2019 in very good shape, despite the challenges posed by Brexit uncertainty and weakening global growth,"" said Oliver Mangan, chief economist at AIB.
""Nonetheless, the rate of expansion in the services sector in 2019 as a whole, though impressive, was the slowest since 2012, indicating that external headwinds did dampen activity somewhat last year."""

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 56.9 in December, the lowest reading in five months, from 58.3 in November. But it stayed far above the 50.0 line indicating expansion.
The slip came as a result of slowed business activity, which at 58.1 was at its lowest since October 2018. Surveyed firms attributed this to increased competitiveness for new work and difficulty closing sales.
The new orders index for December stood at 64.2, only down a little from November's 65.9 which was a more than four-year high.
Employment remained subdued, registering only 50.5 according to the survey.
The data ""points to a short-term setback for the non-oil private sector,"" said Tim Moore, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
""However,"" he added, ""the survey continues to indicate a much stronger improvement in business conditions than at the same time during 2018, particularly in relation to new order books.""
Growth in the non-oil private sector is crucial for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plans to diversify the economy and create jobs in Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter.
On Tuesday, government data showed the economy had contracted by 0.46% in the third quarter, hit by oil output cuts, although non-oil output grew 4.33%."
1541,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:17PM ET</span>",U.S. factory sector in deepest slump in more than 10 years,"By Jason Lange and Dan Burns
(Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector fell into its deepest slump in more than a decade in December as the U.S.-China trade war kept a lid on factory output, orders and employment, although the long-awaited Phase 1 deal between Washington and Beijing could limit further downside.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 47.2 last month from 48.1 in November. It was the lowest reading since June 2009 and, coupled with readings for both new orders and factory employment at multi-year lows, thwarted expectations for a leveling off in the pace of decline in a sector buffeted by trade tensions. 
A reading below 50 indicates the sector is in contraction, and December's reading marked the fifth straight month below that benchmark level. Economists polled by Reuters had been looking for an increase to 49.0.
The manufacturing sector had been under pressure for much of the second half of 2019, as tit-for-tat tariffs by the United States and China slowed the flow of goods between the world's two largest economies and contributed to a cooling in the pace of global economic growth.
Last month, the two sides announced they had reached agreement on a Phase 1 deal, and U.S. President Donald Trump this week said the accord would be signed on Jan. 15 in Washington, and talks to cement a wider Phase 2 deal would begin shortly.
""Global trade remains the most significant cross-industry issue, but there are signs that several industry sectors will improve as a result of the Phase 1 trade agreement,"" Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM's Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said in a statement.
In addition to the drag from trade frictions, Boeing Co's (N:BA) inability to get its 737 Max jetliner back in service may have been a factor, especially in the transportation equipment industry, which was the weakest of the six big industry sectors, according to Fiore. Boeing will cease production of the plane this month until regulators allow it to resume flying in the wake of two crashes, and that could be a headwind in the coming months that may counter improvements arising elsewhere from the trade deal.
While ISM's overall measure of activity in December was the lowest in more than a decade, Fiore said on balance the contraction remains relatively shallow.
""It's not super low,"" he said on a conference call. ""We're still in that range of slight contraction to slight expansion.""
Typically the index would have to drop below 43 to signal the risk of a wider economic recession. Weakness in the manufacturing sector was one of the concerns that spurred the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times last year, although the central bank appears to be done with lowering borrowing costs for now, with officials like Fed Chair Jerome Powell satisfied the economy is in ""a good place.""
CONSTRUCTION SPENDING RISES
Overall, the U.S. economy did appear to be in relatively sound condition near the end of 2019, supported by low unemployment and healthy consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of economic activity. 
The housing sector also appears to be contributing to the growth picture after a prolonged run as a drag. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said U.S. construction spending rose more than expected in November and builders also spent more in earlier months than previously estimated. 
Construction spending increased 0.6% in November, beating analysts' consensus forecast of a 0.3% gain. Data for October and September was revised to show increases in spending, a reversal from previous estimates of contractions in spending during those months.
The gain in November was driven by a 1.9% increase in private home-building, an indication the Fed's rate cuts last year, which drove mortgage rates lower, were boosting the economy.
Meanwhile, several of the largest U.S. automakers on Friday reported another year of stable sales of pickup trucks, fueled by holiday season discounts and lower interest rates on vehicle loans, even as demand for passenger cars fell further.

Analysts expect overall 2019 vehicle sales to fall by about 1% from 2018, but still finish above 17 million vehicles for the fifth consecutive year.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's annual inflation rate rose slightly more than expected to 11.84% in December, official data showed on Friday, ending the year close to a government target and probably narrowing the window for more interest rate cuts in 2020.
The Turkish government, which pushed the central bank for aggressive monetary easing last year to lift the economy from recession, had forecast 12% inflation at the end of 2019 and sees it edging down to 8.5% by the end of 2020.
A Reuters poll had forecast consumer price inflation at 11.56% last month, up from 10.56% in November.
Month-on-month, consumer inflation stood at 0.74% in December, again higher than the poll's forecast of 0.49%.
Turkish inflation readings typically came in lower than expected last year, encouraging the central bank to slash its key policy rate to 12% by December from 24% in July.
The bank says it sets policy to yield a ""reasonable"" real interest rate, which has been compressed by the rise in inflation last month. That could curb room for a bit more policy easing in the first half of 2020, analysts said.
""The room for further policy easing is limited (and) recent depreciation pressure in the currency would put more pressure on the central bank to stop,"" QNB Finansbank economists wrote in a note.
The lira fell 5% against the dollar in the fourth quarter of 2019, due in part to Turkey's military incursion in Syria and the threat of U.S. sanctions. It was down 0.3% on Friday at 0946 GMT after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian commander in Iraq ratcheted up tensions between the two powers.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan fired the central bank's then chief in early July for not following policy instructions, a move that added to doubts about the bank's independence.
Separately, on Friday, the bank scheduled an extraordinary general assembly for January for a second straight year, rather than April as in previous years, so that it could speed up the distribution of its annual profits to the government. The meeting will be held on Jan. 20.
In 2018, annual inflation surged to a 15-year high above 25% as Turkey's currency crisis sent the cost of imports soaring.
Since then, the combination of initially tight monetary policy, weak domestic demand and so-called base effects helped bring price rises down https://tmsnrt.rs/2qbaDqO and by October of 2019 the gauge fell to as low as 8.55%. (Graphic: Turkish end-2019 CPI lower than government target click, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/TURKEY-ECONOMY-INFLATION/0H001QXN69RK/eikon.png)
The consumer price index (CPI) rebounded in the last two months primarily due to base effects, though in December a 43% annual surge in alcoholic beverages and tobacco prices, following tax rises, also lifted the overall measure.
The producer price index rose 0.69% month-on-month in December for an annual rise of 7.36%, data from the Turkish Statistical Institute also showed."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 44.4 from 45.3 in November, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to an improved reading of 45.9.
The survey was conducted between Dec. 5 and 20, straddling Prime Minister Boris Johnson's landslide election win on Dec. 12.
Investors are watching for signs that Johnson's victory has lifted worries about political stability in Britain.
For now, most gauges of the economy look downbeat.
IHS Markit, a data company, published a survey on Thursday showing output in Britain's manufacturing sector fell at the fastest rate in seven years in December.
It said its construction survey showed activity fell particularly hard in civil engineering and also declined in the housebuilding and commercial sectors.
""Brexit uncertainty and spending delays ahead of the general election were once again the most commonly cited factors highlighted by firms experiencing a drop in construction activity,"" Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said.
But some forward-looking figures pointed to better days ahead, he said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong retail sales extended their free-fall in November as months of anti-government protests scared off tourists, hitting spending and threatening the survival of small businesses.
Sales fell 23.6% from a year earlier to HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion), government data showed on Friday. It was the tenth consecutive month of declines and compared with a revised 24.4% drop in October, which was the steepest on record.
As sometimes violent protests spread across various shopping districts, many retail operators, from prime shopping malls to family-run businesses, have been forced to close early or for entire days over the past few months. 
In volume terms, retail sales fell 25.4%, compared with a revised 26.4% drop in October.
""The near-term outlook for the retail trade continues to hinge on how the local social incidents will evolve,"" a government spokesman said. 
""As such, ending violence and restoring social order are essential to the recovery of the retail trade and indeed that of the whole economy.""
Hong Kong sank into recession for the first time in a decade in the third quarter, as the protests plunged the city into its worst crisis since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Paul Chan, the city's financial secretary, said on Sunday that a contraction in the fourth quarter was ""unavoidable"" and the budget in February would focus on boosting the economy.
HIGH-END HURT
Tourist arrivals in Hong Kong plunged 55.9% year-on-year in November, the steepest fall since May 2003, when the city was hit by an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
November tourist arrivals fell to 2.65 million, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board. That compared with a 43.7% plunge in October.
The number of mainland visitors fell 58.4% in November to 1.93 million, accounting for 72.8% of arrivals.
High-end retailers who rely heavily on mainland Chinese spending, have been particularly hard hit.
Sales of jewelry, watches, clocks and valuable gifts plunged 43.5% on-year in November compared with a revised 43% drop in October, data showed. Medicines and cosmetics fell 33.4%, while department store sales dropped 32.9%.
The Hong Kong Retail Management Association (HKMA) estimates about 7,000 businesses, or more than one in 10 retailers, will be forced to close in the next six months. 
HKRMA has called for more government relief measures and urged landlords to cut rents.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's trade surplus shrank 20% to $46.67 billion last year, official data showed on Thursday, as upwardly revised exports in recent months failed to mask a widespread slump in overseas demand for Brazilian goods over the course of 2019.
The upward revisions to exports in the September-November period are likely to lift gross domestic product growth estimates for the last two quarters, but overall, the shrinking surplus will likely prove to have been a drag on economic growth last year.
The surplus in 2020 could be even smaller, Lucas Ferraz, trade secretary at the Economy Ministry, said, as strengthening domestic demand lifts overall economic growth to around 2.3% and spurs imports more than exports.
""This growth will be driven by domestic demand, not external demand ... which will tend to boost imports more than exports,"" Ferraz told reporters in Brasilia, saying that it ""should put pressure on the trade balance."" He said the ministry will not release its 2020 estimate until April.
December's trade surplus was $5.6 billion, the Economy Ministry said, wider than the $4.35 billion median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists. Exports totaled $18.16 billion in the month and imports were $12.56 billion.
For 2019 as a whole, exports were $224 billion and imports were $177.3 billion, resulting in the surplus of $46.67 billion. In 2018, Latin America's largest economy posted a trade surplus of $58 billion.
The 2019 annual surplus was the smallest since 2015, when it was $19.5 billion, amid one of the most severe recessions in Brazil's history. All else being equal, a narrowing trade surplus is a drag on overall economic growth.
Foreign demand for Brazilian products last year was hit by the slowest global growth in a decade, uncertainty surrounding the U.S.-China trade dispute, and a wave of political and economic turmoil across Latin America.
Ferraz said Argentina's renewed slide into economic and political crisis reduced Brazilian exports of manufactured goods by $5.2 billion last year, while the outbreak of African swine fever in China reduced soy exports by $6.7 billion.
Last month, the government revised up September-November exports by a combined $6.5 billion. Statistics agency IBGE's first official estimate of third-quarter GDP growth was 0.6%, with net trade a drag on growth as exports fell 2.8% quarter on quarter.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI), a measure of manufacturing business conditions, fell to a seasonally adjusted 50.4 in December, its lowest level since August, from 51.4 in November. A reading above 50 shows expansion in the sector.
""December data revealed a disappointing end to 2019 for the Canadian manufacturing sector as the steady recovery in production volumes stalled, while new orders fell back into decline,"" said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
The new orders index fell into contraction for the first time since August, dropping to 49.5 from 51.6 in November. Survey respondents pointed to subdued demand across the automotive and energy sectors, as well as difficulties winning new work in U.S. markets.
The four-month low for the PMI follows recent data showing that Canada's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in October and shed more than 70,000 jobs in November.
The PMI's employment index fell to 51.0 from 51.4 in November, while the measure of future output declined to 61.0, its lowest level since February 2016, from 62.3.

""It appears that manufacturers are braced for a lack of new work to replace completed projects in the New Year, with business optimism now at its lowest for almost four years and job creation moving closer to stagnation in the latest survey period,"" Moore said.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 09:07AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims edge lower but trend points to uptick in filings,"By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits edged lower last week, a positive signal for the U.S. labor market amid recent signs that new claims may be trending slightly higher.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Dec. 28, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected 225,000 new claims last week.
While claims have been volatile in recent weeks around the U.S. holiday season and end of the year, longer-term averages suggest the strength in claims data may have ebbed slightly in recent months.
In the latest week, the four-week moving average of initial claims rose by 4,750 to 233,250, the highest level since January 2018.
Still, the underlying trend in claims remains consistent with a labor market that is resisting signs of weakness in other parts of the economy, such as a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and lackluster business investment. 
In November, claims were near a 50-year low.
U.S. stock futures were little changed following the release of the jobless claims data, holding onto gains spurred earlier in the day by fresh economic stimulus from Beijing and optimism around easing trade tensions.
Economists have attributed the weakness in U.S. manufacturing and investment to uncertainty around a U.S.-China trade war launched under U.S. President Donald Trump.
The drop in claims in the latest week unwound a surge in new claims three weeks earlier that appeared to reflect a late Thanksgiving Day this year compared to 2018. By the end of the latest week, the number of new claims was at its lowest since the Nov. 30 week.
Labor market strength is underpinning consumer spending, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global growth that have weighed on manufacturing.
In November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, the lowest in nearly half a century. 

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 5,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Dec. 21.

While most businesses still think Brexit will hurt sales over the long run rather than increase them, the gap narrowed in December, the Bank of England's monthly Decision Makers Panel showed on Thursday.
The proportion expecting an eventual sales boost from Brexit rose to 17% from 13% in November, the highest since May 2018, the BoE survey showed.
Those expecting an eventual hit to sales fell to 33% from 37%.
(GRAPHIC-Brexit pessimism in UK business decreases in December link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/647/643/Annotation%202020-01-02%20114518.png)
Investors are watching for signs that Johnson's victory in the Dec. 12 election has lifted worries about Britain's political stability, potentially providing a much-needed boost to the economy which slowed to a crawl in late 2019.
Still, the outlook in the short-term remains challenging.
The BoE survey showed 53% of businesses cited Brexit as one of their top sources of uncertainty, the lowest share in six months and down from 55% in November.
Separately on Thursday, a British Chambers of Commerce survey of businesses showed ""protracted weakness"" across the economy in the fourth quarter, while an IHS Markit/CIPS report confirmed the sharpest decline in factory output since 2012.
Johnson has said he will clinch a deal settling Britain's future trade ties with the European Union before a deadline on Dec. 31 2020, although trade experts are skeptical about the chances of a comprehensive agreement being struck by then.
Some 42% of companies who took part in the BoE survey did not expect Brexit uncertainty to be resolved until 2021 at the earliest, up from 34% in November.
The survey of 2,887 business executives was conducted between Dec. 6 and Dec. 20."
1555,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",Euro-Zone Factories End 2019 in a Funk as Output and Orders Fade,"(Bloomberg) -- The euro area’s manufacturing downturn deepened in December despite renewed monetary stimulus and nascent signs the regional economy is stabilizing.
IHS Markit’s gauge of factory activity weakened to 46.3, down from November’s 46.9 though slightly better than a flash estimate. It’s the 11th consecutive month in which the reading has been below 50, signaling contraction.
Orders fell, and the rate of job losses was the sharpest since the start of 2013.
The report will come as a disappointment after recent optimism that the bloc’s slowdown was bottoming out as international trade tensions and concerns over a disorderly Brexit ease. The economy is also being supported by a fresh wave of monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank.
“Manufacturers reported a dire end to 2019, with output falling at a rate not exceeded since 2012,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “The ability of the wider economy to avoid sliding into a downturn in the face of such a steep manufacturing contraction remains a key challenge for the euro zone as we head into 2020.”
Producers of intermediate and investment goods suffered most, while growth in consumer goods -- albeit marginal -- was reported for the first time since August.
Germany was again the weakest-performing country, and the contractions in the Netherlands and Italy were the steepest in more than six and a half years. France saw slight growth."
1556,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:46AM ET</span>",UK manufacturing output slides at fastest rate since 2012: PMI,"LONDON (Reuters) - British factory output fell in December at the fastest rate since 2012 as a tepid global economy hurt demand and businesses further reduced stocks of goods they had built up in case of a no-deal Brexit, a survey showed on Thursday.
The output gauge in the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 45.6 from 49.1 in November, its lowest since July 2012. Readings below 50 denote contraction.
The broader headline PMI, which combines gauges of output, employment and orders, fell to 47.5 from 48.9 - revised up only slightly from a preliminary reading of 47.4 and marking a four-month low.
""With demand weak and confidence remaining subdued, input purchasing was pared back sharply and jobs were cut for the ninth successive month,"" said Rob Dobson, an economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Official data last month showed British economic growth slowed to an annual 1.1% in the third quarter of 2019, and it has not been below this rate since 2010, and industrial output dropped by 1.3% year-on-year.
Past PMIs have sometimes overstated economic slowdowns, and do not cover the public sector, where spending is rising. The job market also remains fairly solid with unemployment at a 44-year low.
Thursday's survey was conducted between Dec. 5 and 18, straddling the Dec. 12 election in which Prime Minister Boris Johnson unexpectedly won a large majority, giving him a free hand to pursue his preferred Brexit strategy.
Uncertainty over Brexit depressed business investment in Britain throughout 2019, and the threat of a no-deal Brexit made output volatile as firms repeatedly built up, then reduced, stocks of raw materials as potential deadlines were extended.
Now the country looks on course to leave the European Union on Jan. 31 with a transition deal that avoids new tariffs until the end of 2020, giving Johnson a short window to negotiate a longer-term trade deal with the EU.
Nonetheless, the PMI survey's new orders index remained below the 50 threshold for growth for an eighth month running and close to its lowest level in more than seven years.
IHS Markit said investment demand remained weak in December, but there was stronger demand for consumer goods domestically and for export.
""On this basis, it looks like UK manufacturing and the broader economy may both start the new decade as they began the last, too reliant on consumer spending and still waiting for a sustained improvement in investment levels,"" Dobson said."
1557,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 04:36AM ET</span>",German employment hits record high in 2019,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German employment reached a record high in 2019 as higher labor-market participation and increased immigration of foreign workers more than offset demographic change, the statistics office said on Thursday.
The number of people with jobs rose by 402,000, or 0.9%, to 45.3 million despite weaker economic growth last year, the office said. It grew 1.2% the previous year.
""This means that the uninterrupted growth in employment levels that we have seen over the past 14 years is still continuing, albeit with reduced momentum,"" the office added.
Services recorded the highest year-on-year increase, of 319,000. The number of people with jobs in manufacturing rose by 59,000. Employment in construction rose by 36,000.
The labor market boom is also helping workers get better jobs with improved social security and higher pay.
""The number of employees subject to social insurance contributions increased again, whereas the total of marginally employed people (including those employed on a low-pay or short-term basis) continued to decrease,"" the office said.
The figures bode well for household spending, which has been driving growth in Europe's largest economy and providing a buffer against trade-related problems and weakness in industry.
Employment growth is expected to slow this year as auto companies and car suppliers cope with weaker foreign demand and tariff disputes. They are also having trouble adjusting to stricter regulation following an emissions-cheating scandal and managing a broader shift toward electric cars. [nL8N28E2N3]
The German economy probably grew 0.5% in 2019, down from 1.5% in 2018. The statistics office releases preliminary gross domestic product growth data on Jan. 15.
For 2020, the government forecasts 1.0% overall growth, helped by a higher number of working days. On a calendar-adjusted basis, Berlin predicts 0.6% growth this year."

IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has been below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction since February, and at 46.3 in December it was below November's 46.9 but higher than a preliminary estimate of 45.9.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI that is seen as a good gauge of economic health, sank to 46.1 from 47.4.
""Euro zone manufacturers reported a dire end to 2019, with output falling at a rate not exceeded since 2012,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Although firms grew somewhat more optimistic about the year ahead, a return to growth remains a long way off given that new order inflows continued to fall at one of the fastest rates seen over the past seven years.""
The index measuring new orders dipped to 46.6 from 46.7 and as they did all last year, firms turned to completing backlogs of work to stay active.
Also indicating they don't expect an imminent improvement, purchases of raw materials were reduced and staffing levels cut."

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, fell to 43.7 in December from November's five-month high of 44.1.
The final December reading was slightly above a flash reading of 43.4, but remained below the 50.0 mark separating growth from contraction for the 12th month in a row.
""Germany's manufacturing sector closed out 2019 with another weak performance and remains a thorn in the side of the economy,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""Sustained cuts to workforce numbers at factories continue to pose a threat to Germany's so-far solid consumer spending,"" he added.
With sales abroad hit by an adversarial trade climate, the bulk of Germany's growth momentum is being generated domestically, leaving it exposed to any weakening of the jobs market.
""Importantly, however, the forward-looking survey measures for new orders and output expectations both give off more positive signals as we move into the new year,"" Smith said.
""What's more, the U.S.-China 'Phase 1' trade deal and a potentially clearer path to Brexit make for a more settled backdrop on the international stage."""

The final Purchasing Managers' Index for manufacturers slipped to 50.4 in December from 51.7 in November, data compiler IHS Markit said. November had marked a five-month high. Readings above 50 signal growth in activity.
IHS Markit added that while there had been an improvement in business conditions in French manufacturing in December, the rate of improvement had been the slowest for three months.
The slowdown comes as a nationwide strike cripples France's transport system as trade unions protest against plans by President Emmanuel Macron to overhaul the national pension system.
""Following two promising months in October and November, growth in the French manufacturing sector stuttered during December,"" said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
""The latest data revealed only a marginal increase in production and a fresh contraction in new business. This led firms to cease hiring efforts and reduce their purchases of inputs,"" added Kerr."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy expanded at its slowest pace in a decade last year as its manufacturing sector contracted, preliminary data showed on Thursday, though fourth quarter data firmed expectations for a modest recovery in 2020.
The export-oriented economy has been hit hard by the drawn-out trade war between the United States and China as well as a cyclical global downturn in the electronics sector.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.7% in 2019, the slowest annual pace since 2009 and down from 3.1% in 2018. Authorities expect growth of between 0.5% to 2.5% this year, while Singapore's biggest bank DBS is forecasting a 1.4% expansion. 
With the island nation expected to hold elections within months, economists are looking for ""generous"" fiscal support to bolster growth at the upcoming budget on Feb. 18.
""We are seeing improvement on the growth front although it will likely be a weak recovery,"" said DBS economist Irvin Seah.
""The government is going to roll out the fiscal budget next month and this will likely be very generous,"" he added, citing surpluses accumulated in recent years and upcoming elections, which must be held by early 2021 at the latest.
In the fourth quarter, GDP grew 0.8% in October-December from the same period a year ago, the trade ministry said, in line with analysts' expectations and compared with a revised 0.7% in the previous quarter. 
The economy grew 0.1% quarter-on-quarter on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis, compared with an upwardly revised 2.4% rise the quarter before. That was weaker than the 0.4% expansion expected by analysts. 
Across 2019, the manufacturing sector contracted 1.5% year-on-year, sharply down from 7% expansion in 2018. Services grew at a more modest 1.1% compared to 2.9% in 2018 while there was a turnaround in construction which expanded 2.5% compared with a 3.7% contraction in 2018.
""The global economic slowdown has already affected us. This year we avoided a recession. Our economy is still growing, but less vigorously than we would like,"" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his annual New Year message on Dec. 31.
Singapore's central bank eased policy in October for the first time in three years.
But OCBC's Selena Ling said there was ""no rush"" for further action from the central bank, which holds its next semi-annual meeting in April.

""For now, fiscal policy can do the heavy-lifting,"" said Ling, referring to the upcoming budget.

The AIB IHS Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector edged down to 49.5 in December from 49.7 in November, indicating deteriorating conditions in the sector for the sixth time in seven months, the longest downturn since 2012.
Readings below 50 represent a contraction, with readings above indicating growth.
The survey's authors said the overall downturn was mild, with sharp falls in output and new business mostly offset by the greatest lengthening in suppliers' delivery times in seven months.
A subindex measuring new export orders slipped to 46.5 in December from 47.5 in November.
""The stand-out feature of the December data is the marked decline of new export orders. These have contracted at a significant pace right through the second half of 2019,"" AIB Chief Economist Oliver Mangan said.

The Nikkei/Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) in December rose to 50.1, from 49.4 in November.
It stood just above the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction and was the highest reading since April, when it marginally stood above the threshold at 50.2.
Manufacturing output expanded for the first time in 14 months, helped by new product launches and general boost in demand conditions, the survey showed.
New export orders index jumped to 51.3 in December, from 49.9 in the previous month and the highest reading since June 2018. Panellists reported greater sales to Asian markets such as Japan, China and Vietnam.
Total new orders, which snapped a 13th month of contraction, rose to 50.7, on stronger overall demand and penetration into new overseas markets.
""Perhaps most important was growth in overseas demand, the strongest increase in foreign workloads since mid-2018,"" IHS Markit economist Joe Hayes said.
""Sustained growth in exports will be key to ensuring that South Korea's manufacturing sector can positively contribute to overall economic output,"" Hayes added.
South Korean exports in the first 20 days of December slid 2.0% on-year in value, marking the slowest fall in a year, as recovery in demand from China and stabilizing chip prices offered signs that a year-long run of declines may be nearing its end.
Unlike most sub-indexes where overall improvements were spotted, the pace of job losses accelerated to 47.5 in December, from 49.4 a month earlier. The contraction, the fastest since May 2018, extended the streak into an eight consecutive month, though this had little impact on work efficiency as backlogs of work were also reduced during the month.
The PMI survey showed business sentiment for the next 12 months was cheered by optimism on greater demand in new products and hopes for the trend in the global manufacturing industry to pick up."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports fell in December year-on-year but less than expected, which along with a turn to growth in shipments to China and a slowing pace of decline in chip sales added to optimism for global trade.
Exports by Asia's fourth-largest economy shrank 5.2% in the final month of 2019 from a year earlier, trade ministry data showed on Wednesday, just beating a median 6.0% fall tipped in a Reuters poll.
It was the slowest decline in exports since a 2.1% drop in April 2019 and almost half the average rate of decline seen for the past six months as the global prices of memory chips, the country's top export item, showed signs of picking up.
Analysts said Wednesday's data supported their view that exports, the main engine of growth for South Korea's economy, would turn to growth in early 2020 even though growth thereafter could stay low for a considerable period.
""Today's data was positive in that recovery sustained and exports will return to growth from as soon as February, although the strength of recovery will really depend on how much China's exports to the U.S. increase,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
The brightest spot in the December data was a turn to growth of 3.3% in exports to China, the first growth in 14 months. China is South Korea's top export market and takes in a quarter of the smaller neighbor's total shipments abroad.
Overseas sales of semiconductors, the country's top-selling item, which accounts for one-fifth of its total exports, fell 17.7% year-on-year, but it was the slowest decline in eight months as global prices are stabilizing after a plunge.
Imports dropped 0.7% in December from the year-earlier month, beating both a 13.0% loss in November and a 4.6% decline tipped in the Reuters survey. That brought the month's trade balance to a $2.02 billion surplus versus a $3.34 billion profit in November.
South Korea, the world's leading exporter of chips, smartphones, cars and ships, is the first major economy to report trade data each month, providing an early guide to the health of global trade.
For the whole of 2019, South Korea's exports tumbled 10.3% as global trade cooled and a semiconductor super-cycle crashed, the worst in a decade and the third-worst in the country's modern history.
The trade ministry said exports in 2020 would recover to post growth of around 3%, reflecting a still-shaky recovery in global trade as major economies remained in a slowing mode after years of unstopped expansion.

The decline signals Americans remain cautious in a volatile global environment. At the same time, the index remains at elevated levels, propelled by a solid labor market, rising wages for the average worker, and a cooling trade war with China.Americans are less optimistic about the future, with drops in expectations for employment and income: the share of those seeing more jobs in the next six months dropped to the lowest level since January and those seeing a decrease in income rose to the highest level since May.For current economic conditions, the share of respondents who said jobs were hard to get increased to the highest level since June, while those saying jobs were plentiful also increased.Other recent sentiment are more upbeat, with the University of Michigan survey at a seven-month high and Bloomberg’s index of consumer comfort rising to a nine-week high on greater optimism about the economy and personal finances.Official’s View
“While consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved, their expectations declined, driven primarily by a softening in their short-term outlook regarding jobs and financial prospects,” Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement. “While the economy hasn’t shown signs of further weakening, there is little to suggest that growth, and in particular consumer spending, will gain momentum in early 2020.”

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel's economy grew 3.3% in 2019, its slowest pace since 2015 and below the 2018 rate of 3.4%, the Central Bureau of Statistics said in its preliminary estimate on Tuesday.
Growth this year -- the highest among Western countries and almost double the OECD average of 1.7% -- was weighed down by near-zero growth in investment in fixed assets and weaker exports. That was largely offset by gains in government and consumer spending over 2018.
In its latest estimate, in October, the Bank of Israel had forecast a 2019 growth rate of 3.1%.
The bureau revised third-quarter gross domestic product growth to an annualized 4.0% from an initial 4.1% estimate. It noted gross domestic product has jumped 44% in the past decade.
Growth in 2020 is expected to remain close to 3%, but Bank of Israel policymakers have expressed caution, given the current government stalemate. Israel is headed to a third election in less than a year in March after the failure to form a governing coalition following elections in April and September.
Consequently, a 2020 state budget is unlikely to be approved until at least mid-2020. The current caretaker government is limited in its ability to enact economic policies.
The central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 0.25% on Nov. 25, and most economists expect steady rates for the time being.
But central bankers believe ""there may be a need to increase the extent of monetary policy accommodation going forward"" should the economy weaken, minutes of the discussions showed. The next rates decision is Jan. 9.
In 2019, Israel's economy produced a record 1.4 trillion shekels ($405 billion).
On a per capita basis, the economy grew 1.3% as a result of a 2% rise in the country's population to above 9.1 million, compared with an OECD average of 1.1%.
Investment in fixed assets grew 0.3% this year after a 4.8% jump in 2018. Exports, which account for around 30% of economic activity, increased 3.3%. Private spending -- another economic driver -- grew 3.9% and government spending rose 4.1%.
Israel's economy had grown 3.4% to 4% the prior three years after expanding 2.3% in 2015."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's economy contracted by 0.46% in the third quarter from a year earlier, hit by a drop in oil output as the de facto leader of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut production, government data showed on Tuesday.
Oil sector output declined 6.43%, but non-oil output grew 4.33%, led by private sector activity, the data from the top world crude exporter's General Authority of Statistics said.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the economy contracted by 0.19% in the third quarter on a quarterly basis.
The data came after the Saudi government in its budget cut its forecast for economic growth to 0.4% in 2019 from 0.9%, with growth hit by lower oil prices and crude production cuts agreed by OPEC nations and producers outside the exporting group.
OPEC and its allies have further agreed to deepen crude output cuts by 500,000 barrels per day until March 2020, which could weigh on the Saudi economic recovery in early 2020.
The government expects real GDP growth at 2.3% in 2020.
Mining and quarrying, which accounts for 38.2% of GDP, saw the biggest decline, 6.39%, fuelled by a 6.52% drop in crude petroleum and natural gas output, the data showed.
Petroleum and refining dropped 6.11%, leading to a 2.4% decline in manufacturing output. Manufacturing accounts for 12% of GDP on a constant basis.
The growth in the third quarter came from the wholesale and retail trade, which expanded 8%, while finance, insurance, real estate and business services grew 6.28%.
Economists have said Saudi investments into non-oil projects led by the Public Investment Fund will increasingly drive economic activity in 2020.
As part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's economic diversification plan, proceeds from the sale of oil giant Aramco's 1.5% share sale will be invested in non-oil sectors in a bid to lessen dependence on oil revenue.

Singapore's export-oriented economy has been hit hard this year by the drawn-out trade war between the United States and China as well as a cyclical downturn in the electronics sector.
""The fourth-quarter advance estimate is expected to pick up mainly on the back of stronger growth in construction and services (finance, tourism-related and business services) sectors, which will offset the continued weakness in the manufacturing sector,"" said Maybank Kim Eng economists.
GDP is forecast to have grown 0.4% on a quarter-on-quarter, on a seasonally adjusted and annualized basis in the fourth quarter, according to the median of seven forecasts.
That is slower than the 2.1% expansion in the third quarter when the economy comfortably avoided a recession that was estimated by some analysts.
Last week, data showed that Singapore's industrial output crashed in November, marking its biggest drop in four years, after rising in the previous two months.
""Our 2020 GDP growth forecast for the Singapore economy remains at 1-2% yoy (year-on-year), predicated on a modest manufacturing recovery with the services and construction sectors as providing the growth bulwark,"" said OCBC economist Selena Ling. She forecast 2019 GDP growth of about 0.5%.
Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry will release advance GDP estimates for the fourth quarter and the whole year 2019 on Thursday morning."
1569,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 09:58PM ET</span>",China’s manufacturing PMI expands for second month,"Investing.com – In another sign that China’s economy may be stabilizing, the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) remained in positive territory in December and slightly ahead of expectations. 
China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Tuesday morning that the manufacturing PMI for December came in at 50.2, steady from a month earlier and slightly ahead of the 50.1 reading that economists polled by Reuters had expected. A reading above 50 signals expansion. 
The manufacturing PMI has now expanded for two months in a row, suggesting that the Chinese economy may have hit bottom. 
On a positive note, a sub-index that focuses on new orders for export rose above 50 for the first time in 19 months, coming in at 50.3 compared to 48.8 in November. 
New orders hit 51.2 compared to 51.3 in November while output growth came it at 53.2 compared to 52.6 a month earlier. 
However, the non-manufacturing PMI fell to 53.5 from 54.4. While the reading still shows expansion, it may point to some weakness among new economy industries. 
The subdued but positive PMI reading comes as China and the U.S. prepare to sign a phase one deal on their ongoing trade war that has hit both economies. 
The private Caixin PMI is due out Thursday. The official PMI is focused on larger companies and state-owned enterprises, while the Caixin PMI is more focused on smaller private companies. "
1570,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 08:47PM ET</span>","China's factory activity expands for second month as output, export orders pick up","BEIJING (Reuters) - Factory activity in China expanded for a second straight month in December, as production quickened and export orders rose, offering some support for the manufacturing sector amid signs of progress in trade talks with the United States.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was unchanged at 50.2 in December from November, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday, and remained above the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction. November's gain had ended six straight months of contraction.
Analysts polled by Reuters expected the December PMI to be 50.1.
The better-than-expected readings suggested some recovery in the world's second-largest economy this month. Production rose at the fastest pace in over a year while growth of total new orders remained buoyant, only a notch lower than a recent high hit last month.
December's expansion comes amid signs of improvement in Sino-U.S. trade talks, which have boosted global investor confidence and helped Chinese manufacturers book new orders from abroad. 
New export orders, in particular, rose for the first time since May 2018 in December.
China and the United States announced a Phase 1 agreement that would reduce some U.S. tariffs in exchange for more Chinese purchases of American farm products, which analysts believed could stimulate China's exports and corporate investment in the near-term.
Profits at China's industrial firms grew at the fastest pace in eight months in November on quickening output and sales.
Factories continued to shed jobs in December, but the pace of reduction did not accelerate. 
Over 25 million jobs were trimmed from the industrial sector from end-2013 to end-2018, mostly in labor intensive industries, the latest economic census showed, as labor costs rose.
However, growth in China's services sector activity cooled in December. 
The official non-manufacturing PMI dropped to 53.5, from an eight-month high of 54.4 in November, a separate NBS survey showed.
Beijing has relied on a strong services sector to offset manufacturing weakness. However, a broader economic slowdown since late last year has limited the sector's resilience.
China plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6% in 2020 from this year's 6-6.5%, relying on increased state infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's public sector finances improved further in November, central bank figures showed on Monday, as the deficit as a share of the overall economy shrank to its smallest in over a year and the national debt fell for the third straight month.
The primary deficit for the consolidated public sector, before interest payments are factored in, fell to 1.24% of gross domestic product in the 12 months to November from 1.25% the month before, the smallest shortfall in 13 months.
In hard cash terms, that translated into a deficit of 89.49 billion reais in the 12 months to November, compared with 89.78 billion reais registered in the same period a year ago.
Brazil's right-wing government has made restoring public finances to health one of its top economic priorities, mostly via severe budget freezes and cuts, and pushing through landmark legislation to reform the social security system.
At the start of the year the government projected a primary deficit of more than 130 billion reais for 2019, but the latest Treasury forecasts were that it will be somewhere between 60 and 80 billion reais.
In nominal terms, after interest payments are accounted for, Brazil's nominal deficit last month was 53.2 billion reais, the central bank said, bringing the accumulated deficit over the past 12 months to 458.8 billion reais, or 6.36% of GDP.
The central bank's aggressive interest rate cuts this year have helped reduce interest payments on government debt. In the 12 months to November, interest payments totaled 369.3 billion reais or 5.12% of GDP, compared with 385.6 billion reais or 5.61% of GDP in the same period a year ago.
Brazil's national debt as a share of GDP shrank to 77.7% from 78.3% in October, according to the central bank. That is the lowest since February and marks the third month in a row of decline, a trend not seen since 2011.
These figures suggest Brazil's debt is no longer on track to exceed the 80% of GDP threshold that many analysts said had looked inevitable when it touched a record 79.7% of GDP in August this year.
Earlier this month, S&P Global Ratings revised the outlook on Brazil to positive from stable, citing the government's continued implementation of measures to reduce its deficit."

BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms grew at the fastest pace in eight months in November, but broad weakness in domestic demand remains a risk for company earnings next year. 
China's industrial sector has faced persistent pressure in the past year, with manufacturers battling sluggish demand and a profit-denting trade dispute with the United States. But recent factory activity surveys have pointed to a nascent recovery in the manufacturing sector, following Beijing's accelerated stimulus measures to steady growth. [nL4N2891KL]
Industrial profits in November rose 5.4% from a year earlier to 593.9 billion yuan ($84.93 billion), snapping three months of decline, as production and sales quickened, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday. That compared with a 9.9% drop in October.
For January-November, industrial firms notched profits of 5.61 trillion yuan, down 2.1% from a year earlier, but slightly better than a 2.9% fall in the first 10 months. 
The expansion was mostly due to quickening production and sales, while factory-gate prices contracted at a slower pace, said Zhu Hong, an official with the statistics bureau in a statement released alongside the data.
But he cautioned that the rebound may not be an indication of a sustained recovery.
""Although the profit growth turned to positive in November, we have to see that the current downward pressure on the economy is still big, and the volatility and uncertainty of profit growth still exist due to multiple factors such as market demand and industrial prices.""
In November, profits at state-owned industrial firms rose 0.6% from a year earlier, reversing a declining trend since the second half this year, while private sector profits also posted a significant acceleration in growth. 
Among sectors, the chemical, petroleum processing and steel industries reported recovering profits last month due to rebounding market demand and rising prices. 
""We expect the surge in industrial profit growth to be just short-lived, given strong growth headwinds and still-elevated uncertainty amid U.S.-China trade tensions,"" analysts at Nomura said in a report after the data.
""In our view, Beijing will likely continue to roll out moderate easing measures amid limited policy room.""
EASING TRADE HOSTILITIES
The upbeat figures come amid patchy recoveries in industrial output against broad weakness in demand at home and abroad.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely contracted for a 13th straight month in December, though at a much slower pace, as stabilizing chip prices and a recovery in Chinese demand offered a ray of hope for the trade-reliant economy.
Overseas sales in December were seen falling 6.0% from a year earlier, according to the median forecast of 11 economists polled, the slowest contraction since April, when exports fell a revised 2.1%.
The projected December fall, much better than a 14.4% decline seen in November, is expected to end a sequence of double-digit percentage declines that has lasted six months, a majority of economists said.
""Along with a strong base effect, stabilizing prices for semiconductor, oil and petrochemical products had a positive effect,"" said Ahn So-eun, economist at IBK Securities.
Preliminary data showed South Korea's exports slid 2.0% in the first 20 days of December from a year earlier, the slowest fall in a year, offering signs that a year-long run of declines may be nearing its end.
The contraction in exports began in December last year as the economy, Asia's fourth-largest, has been one of the nations worst-hit by cooling global demand in the wake of the U.S.-China trade war.
Last week, the finance ministry trimmed its economic growth target for next year to 2.4% from an estimated 2.0% rise this year, the worst in a decade, even after two rate cuts and aggressive budget spending.
""There will be one or two quarters of time-lag before the import demand improves, helped by global monetary easing seen in the second half this year,"" Lee Seung-hoon, chief economist at Meritz Securities, said.
South Korea cut key policy rate twice in July and October, joining a global easing trend, to support its faltering economy.
The Reuters poll also forecast that South Korea's consumer prices rising a median 0.6% in December compared with a 0.2% gain in the previous month.
Economists also saw industrial output in November rising by a seasonally adjusted 0.5% from a month earlier.
November industrial output data will be published at 8 a.m. on Monday (2300 GMT Sunday), while inflation figures are expected at 8 a.m. on Tuesday (2300 GMT Monday). Statistics Korea will also announce the inflation figure for the whole of 2019 on the same day.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output slipped for the second straight month in November, raising the likelihood the economy will contract in the fourth quarter due to slowing demand abroad and at home.
Japan's economy has cooled in recent months due to a prolonged hit to exports from soft global demand and a slide in consumer spending following a nationwide tax hike.
Official data showed factory output fell 0.9% in November from the previous month, a slower decline than the 1.4% fall in a Reuters forecast.
That followed a downwardly revised 4.5% decline in the previous month, the largest month-on-month slump since the government started compiling the data in comparative form in January 2013.
""The overall economy including factory output is expected to contract sharply in the current quarter,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""It is expected to rebound in January-March but the issue is how much it will recover.""
Production was pushed down by a decrease in output of production machinery and information equipment, which offset a bounce back in output of cars and car engines.
""There is still uncertainty for the economic outlook as the effects from the U.S.-China trade friction will likely remain but there are positive signals for a moderate pickup in factory output,"" said Hiroaki Mutou, chief economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry expect output to gain 2.8% in December and rise 2.5% in January, the data showed.
Separate data released on Friday showed retail sales dropped a larger-than-expected 2.1% in November as consumer sentiment stayed depressed after October's sales tax hike. 
The weak readings could pressure the government to come up with new ways to boost growth and force the central bank to maintain its stimulus program.
""Economic sentiment has worsened overall,"" said Shudai Hasegawa, a shopkeeper at a store selling rice, pickles and other foods in Tokyo's Shinagawa area.
""There are fewer people in the shopping street here from the start of the year compared to the previous year, and also after the tax hike,"" he said earlier this month.
Kota Watanabe, manager of a store selling pillows and futon mattresses, said demand from older consumers over 50 has been weak this year, partly due to warm weather. 
""They say they are satisfied with cheap goods. There are also people saving money for their children instead of spending it themselves.""
UNDER PRESSURE
The broader economy is likely to stay under pressure as weak business and consumer confidence and a delayed pickup in global growth hurt demand.
The government last week cut its overall view on the economy for the fourth time this year due to a downgrade in its assessment of manufacturing output.
The Bank of Japan stood pat last week though it warned risks to the recovery remained high and offered a gloomier view on output.
Japan's government last week approved a record budget for the coming fiscal year. Part of the planned spending will help finance a $122 billion fiscal package to shore up growth.
Meanwhile, Japan's jobless rate fell in November, while the jobs-to-applicants ratio held steady, suggesting the nation's tightest jobs market in decades is holding up.
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 2.2% in November from 2.4% in the previous month, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications data showed.

Record stock prices, unemployment at a five-decade low and steady wage gains continue to lift spirits, putting the 2019 average sentiment level on track for the best since the 1999-2000 dot-com boom.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Dec. 21, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 224,000 in the latest week. Claims have been volatile in recent weeks around the U.S. holiday season and end of the year.
The drop in the latest week largely unwound a surge in new claims two weeks earlier that appeared to reflect a late Thanksgiving Day this year compared to 2018. That could have thrown off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.

In November, the U.S. unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, the lowest in nearly half a century. 
On Thursday, the Labor Department said claims for California, Hawaii, Kansas, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia and Puerto Rico were estimated for the latest week. 
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up by 2,250 to 228,000. The underlying trend in claims remains consistent with a strong labor market.
Labor market strength is underpinning consumer spending, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global growth that have weighed on manufacturing.

Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 6,000 to 1.72 million for the week ended Dec. 14. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 19,250 to 1.70 million.

Manufacturing output last month fell 9.3% from a year earlier, data from the Singapore Economic Development Board showed on Thursday, the sharpest decline since December 2015.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods barely rose in November and shipments fell, suggesting business investment will probably remain a drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The White House's 17-month-old trade war with China has hurt business confidence, undermining capital expenditure. Despite a recent easing of tensions, regional manufacturing surveys showed business confidence remaining subdued in December. 
Even if business confidence were to improve in early 2020, a surge in capital expenditure is unlikely. Boeing (N:BA) announced last week it would suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January as fallout from two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drags into 2020. Boeing on Monday ousted Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg.
""We expect industrial momentum will remain muted in 2020 amid an environment of sluggish global growth, persistent trade policy uncertainty and subdued corporate profitability,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Boeing's decision to halt production of the 737 MAX will present a continuing drag on orders.""
The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, edged up 0.1% last month as a surge in demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components was partially offset by a drop in machinery orders.
These so-called core capital goods orders rose by an unrevised 1.1% in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.2% in November.
Core capital goods orders rose 0.7% on a year-on-year basis in November. 
The dollar held near a two-week high against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices slipped. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with Boeing shares surging following Muilenburg's ousting.
SHIPMENTS DROP
Shipments of core capital goods dropped 0.3% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Core capital goods shipments rose by a downwardly revised 0.7% in October. They were previously reported to have jumped 0.8%.
Economists said the weak core capital goods shipments posed a downside risk to fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates, which range from as low as a 1.5% annualized rate to as high as a 2.3% pace. The economy grew 2.1% in the third quarter.
While manufacturing is struggling, the housing market is steadily rising, driven by the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts this year. In a second report on Monday, the Commerce Department said new home sales rebounded 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 719,000 units last month, lifted by gains in activity in the Northeast and West regions. 
October's sales pace was, however, revised down to 710,000 units from the previously reported 733,000 units. New home sales are volatile on a month-to-month basis because they are drawn from a small sample of houses selected from building permits. Sales jumped 16.9% from a year ago.
""We expect housing activity to remain supported with now-lower mortgage rates and a Fed on hold, but do not expect a further substantial pick-up in activity into 2020,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Business investment has contracted for two straight quarters, with weak spending on equipment and nonresidential structures such as gas and oil well drilling contributing to the decline that has pushed manufacturing into recession.
Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years is expected to disrupt supply chains, further depressing manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy. Economists estimated the suspension of the 737 MAX aircraft production could cut first-quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a percentage point.
Last month, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, tumbled 2.0% after gaining 0.2% in the prior month.
Durable goods orders were held down by a 72.7% plunge in demand for defense aircraft orders and parts last month. Economists expect a rebound after the U.S. Congress passed a huge defense spending bill last week. 
""The big, bipartisan defense bill that passed Congress last week ensures defense spending will be robust next year, however,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""It’s not a recipe for gangbusters growth, but capital spending should no longer detract from growth next year.""
Orders for transportation equipment dropped 5.9% after edging up 0.1% in October. Motor vehicles and parts orders increased 1.9% in November as the end of a strike at General Motors (N:GM) boosted auto production. Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts fell 1.8% last month.

Overall shipments of durable goods nudged up 0.1% in November, reversing October's 0.1% drop. Durable goods inventories increased 0.4% last month. They have risen in 16 of the last 17 months. Unfilled durable goods orders fell 0.4% in November after being unchanged in October.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2019 10:32AM ET</span>","Canada economy shrinks for first time in eight months, hit by U.S. auto strike","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in October, the first monthly decline since February, partly because of a U.S. auto strike that hit manufacturing, Statistics Canada data indicated on Monday. 
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 0.1% following a 0.1% advance in September. Goods-producing industries posted a 0.5% loss while service sectors were essentially unchanged.
October's growth figures were the latest in a string of disappointing data that analysts say could put pressure on the Bank of Canada to mull a rate cut.
""Today's report may be seem easy to dismiss on its face given the strike-related disruption was well known in advance, but moving past that impact reveals some concerning weaknesses,"" said Brian DePratto, a director at TD Economics.
""Don't write off monetary easing in 2020 just yet."" 
The central bank has held its key rate unchanged since October 2018 even as several of its counterparts, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have eased. In October it forecast fourth quarter annualized Canadian growth would be 1.3% but analysts now say that is likely to be too optimistic.
""Because some of the softness is likely temporary, we look for growth to snap back above 2% in the first quarter of 2020,"" said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The manufacturing sector contracted by 1.4%, the fourth decline in five months. Durable manufacturing dropped by 2.3% as a strike by the United Auto Workers prompted some Canadian plants and parts producers to scale back production.
The Bank of Canada's next fixed rate announcement date is Jan 22 and market expectations, as reflected in the overnight index swaps markets, show operators expect it to stay put.
Statscan said retail trade in October fell by 1.1%, the largest decline since March 2016, on broad-based weakness. Transportation and warehousing rose by 0.6% on strength in the aviation sector, both in passengers and cargo.

""Although the Canadian economy is going through a soft patch in the fourth quarter, some of it is due to temporary disruptions that should be reversed early next year,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief North American economist at Capital Economics.

The Commerce Department said on Monday new home sales rebounded 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 719,000 units last month, lifted by gains in activity in the Northeast and West regions. October's sales pace was revised down to 710,000 units from the previously reported 733,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.8% of housing market sales, rising to a pace of 734,000 units in November.
New home sales are drawn from permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis.
Sales surged 16.9% from a year ago.
The housing market is regaining momentum after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times this year, pushing down mortgage rates from last year's multi-year highs. Single-family building permits scaled their highest level since July 2007 in November. Confidence among homebuilders in December reached levels last seen since June 1999.
But land and labor shortage are constraining builders' ability to ramp up the construction of more affordable homes, limiting gains for the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of the economy.
The median new house price increased 7.2% to $330,800 in November from a year ago. Sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000-$400,000 price range. Homes priced below $200,000, the most sought after, accounted for only 10% of sales.
New home sales in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, dropped 4.1% in November. Sales in the Northeast jumped 52.4%. Sales were unchanged in the Midwest, but rose 7.5% in the West.
There were 323,000 new homes on the market last month, unchanged from October. At November's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.5 months in October."

Bookings for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft -- a proxy for business investment -- rose 0.1%, matching projections, after a 1.1% jump in October that followed consecutive monthly declines, according to Commerce Department figures issued Monday.
Orders for all durable goods, or items meant to last at least three years, unexpectedly dropped 2%, reflecting a slump in military aircraft and a drop in civilian planes.
Key Insights

Combined with a decrease in core shipments, the figures highlight a lack of appetite for capital expenditures, with profit growth cooling and business sentiment still subdued amid global demand concerns. Despite a thawing in the U.S.- China trade war after this month’s phase-one agreement, a more sweeping deal that could spark greater investment and re- charge world growth prospects is a bigger challenge.
Other recent reports have showed manufacturing, while no longer suffering larger setbacks, remains weak. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s factory index dropped in December to a six-month low, while the New York Fed’s manufacturing gauge barely expanded.
The headline durable-goods figure was pressured by a decline in orders of commercial aircraft despite   Boeing Co   (NYSE:BA) reporting earlier this month that it received 63 orders in November compared with just 10 in October. Orders for motor vehicles and parts rebounded, likely reflecting the effects of the end of the auto workers’ strike at General Motors Company (NYSE:GM).

 
Shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft -- a measure used in gross domestic product calculations -- fell 0.3% after a 0.7% increase. The report showed core business- equipment shipments fell 2.9% on a three-month annualized basis through November.Excluding transportation equipment, which tends to be volatile, durable-goods orders were little changed after a 0.3% gain.

1590,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 22, 2019 11:37PM ET</span>",Early South Korea Export Data Hint at Global Green Shoots,"(Bloomberg) -- Early South Korea trade figures for December show monthly exports could decline less than double-digits for the first time since May, offering another sign that the global manufacturing slump may be reaching a bottom.
Exports during the first 20 days of of the month fell 2% from a year earlier, the Korea Customs Service said Monday. Shipments to China rose 5.3%, on course to post the first monthly gain in more than a year.
Semiconductor sales, which account for the largest share of South Korean exports, declined 17%, improving from more-than-20% declines in previous months.
Monday’s figures offered support to economists looking for more evidence of green shoots in the global economy after recent improvements in factory data from China to Germany and signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks. The 20-day trade report is closely watched as an indicator of global demand due to its early release each month and Korea’s key position in electronics supply chains.
“This confirms the view that exports have entered the stage of recovery,” said Park Sang-hyun, an economist for HI Investment & Securities in Seoul. “If the upturn continues, it would be a signal of improvement for not just South Korean exports but global trade and manufacturing.”
For South Korea, a yearlong drop in exports has put the economy on course for its slowest expansion in a decade. A finance ministry official last week said the government is cautiously optimistic that an improving global economy will help fuel a recovery next year.
South Korean imports fell 0.5% in the first twenty days of December from a year earlier. Exports to the U.S. edged down 3.4%, while imports rose 7.9%. Shipments to Japan rose 6.2% as imports dropped at the same pace.
South Korea’s exports during Dec. 1-20 expanded 8.1% from the same period a month earlier, while imports gained 9.1%. Data for the full month is released on Jan. 1.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports fell again in the first 20 days of December, but a recovery in demand from China and stabilizing chip prices offered signs that a year-long run of declines may be nearing its end.
Exports by Asia's fourth-largest economy during December 1-20 slid 2.0% on-year in value, customs data showed on Monday, the slowest fall in a year and far better than a 9.6% loss for the comparable 20-day period of November.
The average exports value per working day, a useful measure of a near-term trend after adjustment for calendar effects, slid 5.1% for the Dec. 1-20 period on-year, improving from a 9.6% fall in the Nov. 1-20 period and the best outcome in nine months.
""Given the increase in exports to China and the slower pace of contraction in chip sales, today's figure show exports are on the path of recovery,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
Shipments to China rose 5.3% on-year during the 20-day period. South Korea's largest export market takes in more than a quarter of its smaller neighbor's total sales abroad.
Monday's data supported expectations by many analysts that South Korean exports would return to annual growth from January, ending a year-long streak of year-on-year declines, Park said.
Imports fell 0.5% during the 20-day period, better than an 11.2% decline in the Nov. 1-20 period. The trade surplus narrowed to $0.33 billion during the period from $0.55 billion in the same period a month earlier.
Overseas sales of semiconductors, the country's major export, fell 16.7% in the Dec. 1-20 period versus a year ago, mainly attributable to a plunge in global prices despite solid demand in volume.
South Korea is due to announce trade figures for the whole of December on Jan. 1, 2020.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 02:06PM ET</span>",Colombia's central bank holds key lending rate at 4.25%,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's central bank on Friday unanimously held its benchmark interest rate at 4.25% yet again, a rate the bank chief said could remain in place for a ""relatively long period"" as inflation and growth risks diminish.
Consumer prices have been well above the bank's 3% target since March, but the seven-member board has kept lending rates unchanged since last year in a bid to stimulate economic growth, which the bank predicts will end 2019 at 3.2%.
The decision met the predictions of all analysts in a Reuters survey last week. Those polled expect the board to hold the rate throughout 2020.
""What we are seeing is a relatively long period of relatively stable rates,"" bank chief Juan Jose Echavarria told journalists. ""My best prediction is that we could hold rates for an additional time.""
The board last moved the rate in April 2018.
""Supply shocks that have affected inflation are expected to begin to subside and in early 2020 inflation will resume its convergence to the target, as reflected in market expectations,"" the board said in a statement, adding deviations from the target are ""transitory.""
Analysts predict inflation will close 2019 at 3.8%.
There remained uncertainty about the persistence of the depreciation of the peso currency, the statement added, and its ""pass-through to domestic prices.""
The peso has fallen 3.3% against the dollar so far in 2019.
The stable interest rate has benefited Latin America's fourth-largest economy. Growth of above 3% this year would make the country one of the region's best performers economically.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 02:03PM ET</span>",U.S. consumers put economy on moderate growth path in third quarter,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth nudged up in the third quarter and the economy appears to have maintained the moderate pace of expansion as the year ended, supported by a strong labor market.
Other data on Friday showed consumer spending increased solidly in November, adding to a string of upbeat data that have helped to quell recession fears which gripped financial markets in the summer. 
The longest expansion in history, now in its 11th year, remains on track thanks to the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates three times this year. The U.S. central bank last week kept rates steady and signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through 2020. 
Though growth has been relatively strong, economists did not expect the economy to achieve the Trump administration's 3.0% target this year. Still, the resilient economy could offer some respite for President Donald Trump who was impeached on charges of abusing his office on Wednesday by the Democratic-led House of Representatives.
""The data will comfort the Fed that the economy is in 'a good place' and monetary policy is 'appropriate',"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was unrevised from November's estimate. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June period.
Despite the unrevised estimate, which was in line with economists' expectations, consumer spending was stronger than previously reported in the third quarter. 
There were also upgrades to business spending on nonresidential structures such as power infrastructure, which limited the drop in overall business investment. That offset downward revisions to investment in homebuilding and inventory accumulation. Imports, which are a drag to GDP growth, were higher than previously estimated.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter range from as low as a 1.5% rate to as high as a 2.3% pace. Growth has slowed from the 3.1% rate notched in the first three months of the year in part because of the 17-month trade war between the United States and China and the fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package. 
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the last quarter, rather than the 2.4% pace estimated in November. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9% in the second quarter. 
The revision to the income side of the growth ledger reflected a downgrade to corporate profits.
After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, were revised down to show them declining $23.1 billion, or at a rate of 1.2%. Profits were previously reported to have decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6% in the third quarter.
They were in part held down by legal settlements with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Profits increased at a 3.3% rate in the second quarter. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, also increased at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. 
The data boosted the dollar against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were treading higher, pushing key indexes to new record highs.
MODERATE GROWTH PATH
The economy's moderate growth speed appears to have persisted in the fourth quarter. In a second report on Friday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% last month as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and spent more on healthcare. Consumption increased 0.3% in October.
Consumer spending is being supported by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century. But inflation stayed tame last month and could remain so for a while. The University of Michigan's survey of consumers showed households' one-year inflation expectations fell in December to 2.3%, the lowest in three years, from 2.5% in November. 
""If this month's drop in inflation expectations is sustained or intensifies, it would be concerning to the Fed, which is trying to lift inflation, and would suggest easier monetary policy than would prevail otherwise,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Despite the economy improving prospects, risks remain. Boeing's (N:BA) decision this week to suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January after two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft means the fallout is likely to drag into 2020. That could pressure the fragile manufacturing sector, which was starting to stabilize as the U.S.-China trade tensions ebb.
Economists estimate that Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years, which is expected to wreak havoc on supply chains, could cut first-quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a percentage point.
In the GDP report, growth in consumer spending was raised to a 3.2% rate in the third quarter from the previously reported 2.9% pace. Inventories rose at a $69.4 billion pace instead of the $79.8 billion rate reported last month. 

Business investment dropped at a 2.3% rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 2.7% pace as previously reported. Spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells declined at a 9.9% rate instead of the previously reported 12.0% pace.

1595,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 10:51AM ET</span>","U.S. Consumption, Incomes Pick Up in Sign of Holiday Cheer","(Bloomberg) -- Americans’ spending picked up in November and income gains topped projections, offering hope for a solid holiday-shopping season and indicating household consumption will continue to be the economy’s main driver at year-end.
Purchases, which account for about two-thirds of the economy, rose 0.3% from the prior month after adjusting for inflation, following a 0.1% increase in October, Commerce Department data showed Friday. That exceeded the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists, while the nominal spending gain of 0.4% matched forecasts.
Consumers have carried the economy in 2019 amid fluctuations in trade policy, weakness in manufacturing and a pullback in business investment. While spending may still cool from robust gains in the previous two quarters, the figures suggest Americans can continue to fuel the record-long expansion next year amid a strong job market.
A separate report Friday from the University of Michigan showed consumer sentiment in December increased for a fourth month to the highest level since May, though was little changed from the preliminary reading.
Nominal personal income rose 0.5% in November from the prior month, exceeding the median estimate for a 0.3% gain, with wages and salaries advancing a healthy 0.4%. Inflation-adjusted disposable income rose 0.4% following a 0.2% drop in October, while the personal saving rate rose to 7.9%.
The gain in November spending was driven by new motor vehicles and health care, according to the report. The figures indicate consumption is stabilizing following softer-than-expected retail sales across some categories earlier this month.
Muted Inflation
Inflation remained short, though, of the Federal Reserve’s goal despite three interest-rate cuts this year. The personal consumption expenditures price gauge, which the Fed officially targets for 2% inflation, rose 0.2% from the prior month and 1.5% from a year earlier, with the annual change slightly above projections.
The core PCE price index, which excludes food and energy, increased at a 1.3% annualized rate over the past three months, though the 1.6% rise from a year earlier was above forecasts. Policy makers view the core gauge as a better indicator of underlying price trends and have said they’re also aiming for it to rise 2%.
The University of Michigan survey showed U.S. consumer expectations for inflation over the longer term fell to the lowest on record at 2.2%.
A separate Commerce Department report out earlier Friday showed Americans’ spending grew by more than previously reported in the third quarter, a change offset by a drag in inventories that left economic growth at a still-healthy but unrevised 2.1%.

Year-ahead price expectations were revised down to 2.3%, the tamest since the end of 2016, from a preliminary reading of 2.4%.
This may spark some concern among Federal Reserve policy makers who believe price expectations are a leading driver of actual inflation. Price gains have persistently come in below the Fed's 2% target since it was adopted in 2012.
The university's final December consumer sentiment index was 99.3, little changed from the preliminary figure of 99.2, and up from November's 96.8 and a seven-month high.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 10:13AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending rises; inflation tame,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in November, pointing to moderate economic growth that could potentially support the Federal Reserve's desire to keep interest rates unchanged indefinitely, though inflation remained muted.
The Commerce Department said on Friday consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% last month as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and spent more on healthcare. Consumer spending increased by an unrevised 0.3% in October.
Last month's gain in consumer spending was in line with economists' expectations.
Consumer spending is holding up despite tepid retail sales in recent months and is being supported by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century.
The Fed last week kept rates steady and signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through 2020. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times this year.
Steady consumer spending added to upbeat data on homebuilding. Manufacturing appears to be stabilizing as tensions in the 17-month trade war between the United States and China subside. But Boeing's BA.N decision this week to suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January as fallout from two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drags into 2020 could delay the turnaround in manufacturing.
Economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter range from as low as a 1.3% annualized rate to as high as a 2.3% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter.
Inflation was benign in November. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.2% last month, lifted by gains in energy goods and services prices. The PCE price index increased 0.2% in October.
In the 12 months through November, the PCE price index increased 1.5% after advancing 1.4% in October.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index edged up 0.1% last month, rising by the same margin for the fourth straight month. That lowered the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.6% in November from 1.7% in October.
The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, and had undershot the U.S. central bank's 2% target this year.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending climbed 0.3% in November after nudging up 0.1% in October.
Personal income jumped 0.5% in November, lifted by gains in wages, interest income and farm proprietors' income, likely related to payments to farmers caught in the 17-month U.S.-China trade war.
Wages increased 0.4% in November after rising 0.5% in October. With income growth slightly outpacing spending, savings rose to $1.31 trillion last month from $1.30 trillion in October."
1598,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 08:44AM ET</span>",Consumer-Spending Bump Offset by Inventories in Revised U.S. GDP,"(Bloomberg) -- Americans' spending grew by more than previously reported in the third quarter, a change offset by a drag in inventories that left economic growth at a still-healthy but unrevised 2.1%.
Consumer outlays, which make up two-thirds of the economy, rose at a 3.2% annualized pace in the July-September period, up from a previously reported 2.9% gain, according to the Commerce Department's third estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product released Friday.
The figures indicate spending was even more important than previously thought in helping the U.S. economy eke out a pickup from the second quarter's 2% growth, as business investment fell by the most since 2015. Consumption is forecast to slow in the fourth quarter, however, and November figures due later Friday will give a sense of the depth of any weakness.
The change to the consumer-spending figure reflected upward revisions to spending on personal care and financial services, particularly portfolio management and investment advice. Inventories were revised lower on wholesale trade, especially nondurable goods, according to the report.
The change in private inventories dragged down the rate of GDP growth by 0.03 percentage point in the quarter, revised from a boost of 0.17 point.
Corporate profits fell 0.2% from the prior quarter, compared with a previously reported 0.2% increase. The prior estimate already reflected $6 billion in legal settlements with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Excluding the typically volatile trade and inventories components of GDP, final sales to domestic purchasers increased at a 2.2% pace that was revised from 2%. Economists monitor this measure for a better sense of underlying demand.
Earlier this month, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected U.S. growth to cool to 1.6% in the final three months of the year before picking up slightly in 2020. At the same time, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.'s decision to pause production of the grounded 737 Max jet will reduce first-quarter growth by about a half percentage point, several analysts estimated this week.
Inflation showed signs of a pickup in the third quarter though remains broadly muted. The personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy, rose at an unrevised 2.1% annualized pace in the period, up from 1.9% in the previous quarter.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 08:43AM ET</span>",U.S. third-quarter growth unrevised at 2.1%,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth nudged up in the third quarter, the government confirmed on Friday, and there are signs the economy more or less maintained the moderate pace of expansion as the year ended, supported by a strong labor market.
Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was unrevised from last month's estimate. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June period.
Despite the unrevised reading, which was in line with economists' expectations, consumer spending was stronger than previously reported. There were also upgrades to business spending on nonresidential structures such as power infrastructure, which limited the drop in overall business investment. That offset downward revisions to investment in homebuilding and inventory accumulation. Imports, which are a drag to GDP growth, were higher than previously estimated.
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the last quarter, rather than the 2.4% pace estimated in November. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9% in the second quarter.
The revision to the income side of the growth ledger reflected a downgrade to corporate profits.
After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, were revised down to show them declining $23.1 billion, or at a rate of 1.2%. Profits were previously reported to have decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6% in the third quarter.
They were in part held down by legal settlements with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Profits increased at a 3.3% rate in the second quarter.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, increased at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. That was down from the previously reported 2.3% pace and an acceleration from a 1.4% growth rate in the second quarter.
MODERATE GROWTH PATH
The economy appears to have maintained its moderate growth speed in the fourth quarter, with the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century supporting consumer spending. Recession fears, which gripped financial markets in the summer, have faded.
The Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts this year are lifting the housing market. The U.S. central bank last week kept rates steady and signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through 2020.
Manufacturing looks to be stabilizing as tensions in the 17-month trade war between the United States and China ease. A turnaround in manufacturing could, however, be delayed after Boeing (NYSE:BA) BA.N announced on Monday it would suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January as fallout from two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drags into 2020.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter range from as low as a 1.3% rate to as high as a 2.3% pace. Though growth has been relatively strong, economists did not expect the economy to achieve the Trump administration's 3.0% target this year.
The economy grew 2.6% in the first half. Growth has slowed from the 3.1% rate notched in the first three months of the year in part because of the U.S.-China trade war and as the stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package fades.
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was raised to a 3.2% rate in the third quarter from the previously reported 2.9% pace. Inventories rose at a $69.4 billion pace instead of the $79.8 billion rate reported last month.
As a result of the smaller build, inventories were neutral to GDP growth last quarter, instead of adding 0.17 percentage point as previously reported. The trade deficit increased at a $990.1 billion rate instead of the previously reported $988.3 billion pace. The wider trade gap, which reflected higher imports, subtracted 0.14 percentage point from GDP growth, rather than the 0.11 percentage point estimates last month.
Business investment dropped at a 2.3% rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 2.7% pace as previously reported. Spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells declined at a 9.9% rate instead of the previously reported 12.0% pace.
Growth in residential investment was lowered to a 4.6% rate from the 5.1% pace estimated last month. Government spending growth was raised to a 1.7% rate from a 1.6% pace."

DIW said Europe's largest economy probably contracted by 0.1% in the October-December period.
""We could at most hope for stagnation,"" said DIW economist Claus Michelsen.
DIW's forecast contrasted with a rosy estimate by the Ifo institute, which this week said Europe's biggest economy probably expanded by 0.2% in the fourth quarter.
Manufacturing has been weakening since the start of the year, slowing a 10-year growth cycle. Consumption, state spending and construction have been cushioning the economy.
German manufacturers are coping with trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty. The car industry also faces a costly shift to electric vehicles and stricter emissions rules.
Economy Minister Peter Altamier said that increased clarity on Brexit has helped Germany avoid a recession.
Following Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election victory, the British parliament will vote on his deal to leave the European Union on Friday. The bill should face little opposition.
Altmaier also told Der Spiegel magazine that he expects trade tensions between the United States and the EU to ease. Donald Trump and the European Commission have imposed tariffs on traded goods and the U.S. president has threatened to impose levies on European cars and car parts.
""I don't think that the U.S. president has a big interest in having a trade war with Europe one year before the election,"" Der Spiegel quoted Altmaier as saying.
DIW said that despite the gloom, German industry was showing signs of optimism.
""German companies are again looking positively into the future, especially when it comes to their international business,"" said Michelsen.
The economy narrowly avoided recession in the third quarter, growing by 0.1% in the third quarter after contracting by 0.2% in the April-June period.
A strong labor market is expected to continue providing support for the economy. Data published on Friday showed that real wages rose by 1.9% in the third quarter compared with the same quarter in 2018 - the largest increase since early 2016."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew a little faster in the third quarter than first estimated and the country's current account deficit shrank to its smallest since 2012, a small boost ahead of what looks set to be a sluggish end to the year ahead of Brexit. 
The world's fifth-biggest economy grew 0.4% in the third quarter of the year, better than a previous estimate of 0.3% and boosted by upward revisions to services and construction output, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
While the data was better than any analyst polled by Reuters predicted, incoming Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey - appointed earlier on Friday - will probably be more concerned by other recent gauges of the economy that show it has slowed to a crawl in late 2019.
""The underlying picture is still that there is very little momentum in the economy,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics.
The ONS said a surge in goods exports helped Britain's balance of payments deficit narrow to 15.860 billion pounds ($20.68 billion)in the third quarter from 24.152 billion pounds in the second quarter, roughly in line with expectations.
As a percentage of economic output, the deficit fell to 2.8%, its smallest since early 2012.
The BoE's departing governor, Mark Carney, described Britain as dependent ""on the kindness of strangers"" before the 2016 Brexit referendum. On Monday the BoE said the current account deficit still posed economic risks.
British trade flows have been volatile in 2019 and the boost from trade is unlikely to be sustained, especially with global demand weakened by a U.S.-China trade war.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson swept to a landslide victory last week, removing some of Britain's political uncertainty.
Nonetheless, he has promised to strike a trade deal with the European Union by the end of 2020 and will not extend the Brexit transition - a deadline that leaves open the prospect of another cliff-edge for businesses and investors.
The economy grew by 1.1% in the year to the end of September, up from an earlier estimate of 1.0%. A Reuters poll of economists suggested the economy will grow 1.3% this year.
The BoE said on Thursday it was waiting for more signals about how much last week's election was easing the uncertainty that has weighed on the economy.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2019 05:56AM ET</span>",German consumer morale darkens heading into January: GfK,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German consumers deteriorated unexpectedly heading into January, a survey showed on Friday, suggesting that household spending in Europe's largest economy could weaken at the beginning of next year.
The consumer sentiment indicator, published by the Nuremberg-based GfK institute and based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, edged down to 9.6 from 9.7 in December. A Reuters poll of analysts had predicted an increase to 9.8.
Household spending has turned into a steady and reliable driver of growth in Germany helped by record-high employment, inflation-busting pay hikes and historically low borrowing costs, providing a buffer against trade-related problems.
GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said consumers were more pessimistic about the overall economic growth outlook. They also scaled back their personal income expectations, with GfK's sub-indicator falling to the lowest level in more than six years.
""News about job cuts in some industrial sectors, such as the car industry and automobile suppliers, are leading to less optimistic income expectations,"" Buerkl said.
Germany's main automobile industry body VDA said earlier this month it excepted global car sales to fall by 5% this year and it warned of more job cuts in 2020 as a result.
The Ifo institute expects the German economy to pick up steam in the fourth quarter, predicting a quarterly growth rate of 0.2% following a 0.1% expansion in the third quarter.
For 2019 as a whole, the government forecast 0.5% growth, which would be the weakest performance since 2013. It predicts a modest rebound with 1.0% growth next year."
1603,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 08:11PM ET</span>","Japan's consumer inflation ticks up as shoppers pay more for sushi, ice cream","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual core consumer inflation ticked up in November and a key price gauge hit a more than three-year high, suggesting that firms are gradually passing on rising labor and tax hike costs to shoppers.
All the same, inflation remained distant from the Bank of Japan's 2% target, underscoring the challenge the central bank faces in propping up prices as the economy shows sign of slowing.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.5% in November from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, matching a median market forecast and accelerating from a 0.4% gain in October.
The so-called core-core inflation index, which strips away the effect of both volatile fresh food and energy costs, was up 0.8% in November, marking the fastest year-on-year increase since April 2016.
The rise in the core-core CPI, closely watched by the BOJ as a key measurement on the broad inflation trend, reflects price hikes for a wide range of goods and services, a government official told reporters on the data.
Shoppers paid 5% more for sushi in November than a year ago and 8% more for a cup of ice cream. They spent 36% more for electric vacuum machines as high-end models sold well, the official said.
Analysts, however, doubt whether the rise will have legs given signs of slowdown in the economy.
""The rise in inflation excluding fresh food and energy ... is a positive sign for the Bank of Japan and will allow them to claim with more confidence that momentum towards their 2% price target is maintained,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""However, we expect underlying inflation to moderate to around 0.4% as the unemployment rate climbs and capacity utilization falls.""
The BOJ kept monetary policy steady on Thursday on the view that solid domestic demand will make up for weak exports, which have been hit by the U.S.-China trade war.
But many analysts expect Japan's economy, which expanded an annualized 1.8% in the third quarter, to have contracted in the current quarter as a sales tax hike in October cools consumption.
Households cut spending for the first time in a year in October, even as wages crept up reflecting a tight job market.
Factory output suffered its largest fall in two years in October and big manufacturers' business sentiment sank to a near seven-year low in the fourth quarter, underlining the fragile state of Japan's recovery.
Left with few ammunition to fire up inflation, the BOJ is seen keeping policy steady for the time being unless a severe shock hits the economy - including at its rate review next month.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the bank will take into account the expected boost to growth from the government's spending package when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price projections at the January rate review."

Consumer confidence rose to -11 in December from -14 in November, according to the long-running survey from market research firm GfK. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to an unchanged reading on the month.
Similarly, a Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank gauge of business confidence also rose to its highest level since July at 10%, up a point from last month.
Both surveys were conducted before the result of the Dec. 12 election in which Johnson secured a big majority in parliament, removing some uncertainty hanging over the British economy.

The companies signed up for $7.8 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $8 billion a year earlier. Borrowings fell 23% from the previous month.
""Uncertainty brought on by the prolonged trade frictions with China...was partly responsible for this slowdown,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said, adding that credit markets were performing well, with losses and delinquencies in acceptable ranges.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 75.7% in November, down from 76.3% in October.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which typically follows a few days later.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL)  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped from a more than two-year high last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that should continue to underpin consumer spending and the economy.
While other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region almost stalling this month, manufacturers received more orders, increased shipments and boosted hours for employees. Their outlook for capital expenditure over the next six months was also upbeat, offering some tentative signs of stabilization in manufacturing amid an easing in tensions in the 17-month trade war between the United States and China.
The trade tensions have bruised business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure, leading to a downturn in national manufacturing activity. But a turnaround in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, could be delayed. Boeing (NYSE:BA) announced on Monday it would suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January as fallout from two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drags into 2020.
Economists estimated that Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years, which is expected to wreak havoc on supply chains, could cut first-quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a percentage point.
""The economy isn't going off the rails here,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""But at the same time, it isn't setting any land speed records.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Dec. 14, the Labor Department said.
The drop, which only partially unwound the prior week's jump of 49,000, likely does not indicate a material shift in labor market conditions as claims data tend to be volatile in the period following the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
The surge in the week ended Dec. 7, which boosted claims to 252,000 - the highest reading since September 2017 - probably reflected a late Thanksgiving Day this year compared to 2018. That could have thrown off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 225,000 in the latest week. They expect claims to remain elevated relative to October's low reading given volatility in the data around the holiday season and end of the year.
""At this point we are not concerned about the rise in initial claims and view it as a statistical quirk related to the seasonal adjustment process around Thanksgiving,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
A second report on Thursday from the National Association of Realtors showed existing home sales dropped 1.7% in November. Home resales, however, increased 2.7% from a year ago. The solid labor market and low mortgage rates are driving demand for housing.
The dollar was steady against a basket currencies, while prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Financial markets were unmoved by the impeachment late on Wednesday of President Donald Trump, who is unlikely to be removed from office.
MIXED FACTORY DATA
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,500 to 225,500 last week - still consistent with a strong labor market.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of December's employment report.
The four-week moving average of claims rose 4,250 between the November and December survey periods, suggesting some cooling in job growth. The economy added 266,000 jobs in November, the most in 10 months. The unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, the lowest in nearly half a century.
Labor market strength is supporting consumer spending, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite headwinds from the trade tensions and slowing global growth.
In a third report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business conditions index dropped to a reading of 0.3 in December from 10.4 in November. But there were increases in measures of new orders, unfilled orders, factory hours and shipments.
While manufacturers reported paying higher prices for raw materials and other inputs, they appeared unable to pass on the higher costs to consumers in a significant way.
The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month business conditions index slipped to a reading of 35.2 this month from 35.8 in November. Its six-month capital expenditures index jumped to 27.6 from a reading of 19.4 in the prior month.
The mixed readings in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware mirror other measures on factory activity.
A survey from the New York Fed on Monday showed its business conditions index remaining subdued for the seventh consecutive month. Manufacturers were, however, optimistic about business conditions over the next six months.
""They (surveys) show little clear sign of the pronounced rebound in sentiment that we had hoped to see after recent developments on trade policy and strength in risky asset markets, but they have also shown little sign of further deterioration,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York."

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing home sales fell 1.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.35 million units last month. October's sales pace was downwardly revised to 5.44 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales declining 0.2% to 5.44 million units.
The U.S. central bank's decision to lower borrowing costs three times this year to shield the economy from slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade war has pushed down mortgage rates from 2018's multi-year highs.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped more than 130 basis points since last November's peak to an average of 3.73%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Existing home sales still rose 2.7% from one year ago, NAR said, the fifth straight month of year-on-year gains. Last week the Fed made clear it plans to leave rates unchanged for the foreseeable future with 13 of the 17 policymakers currently predicting rates holding steady through 2020.
Sales were mixed across the nation's four regions last month. They climbed 2.3% in the Midwest and rose 1.4% in the Northeast. In the South, they declined 3.9% and fell 3.5% in the West.
The housing market, which makes up about 3.1% of the economy, has been lifted this year by the drop in rates, but gains have been curbed by a persistent lack of properties for sale, which has inflated prices, as well as a shortage of land and labor.
There are some hopeful signs. A survey on Monday showed confidence among homebuilders jumped in December to the highest level since June 1999 and on Tuesday, data showed U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in November and permits for future home construction surged to a 12-1/2-year high.
There were 1.64 million homes on the market last month, a decline of 5.7% compared to a year ago, NAR said. The median existing house price rose 5.4% from a year ago to $271,300 in November. It was the 93rd consecutive month of year-on-year price gains.
""America is facing a housing shortage,"" said Jessica Lautz, NAR's vice president of demographics and behavioral insights. ""We need more home construction.""
At November's sales pace, it would take 3.7 months to clear the current inventory, down from 4.0 months a year ago. A supply of six to seven months is seen as a healthy balance between supply and demand."

The Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, decreased 0.9% to $124.1 billion last quarter, the lowest level since the second quarter of 2018.
Data for the second quarter was revised to show the deficit declining to $125.2 billion, instead of the previously reported $128.2 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account deficit would tighten to $122.1 billion in the third quarter.
The current account gap represented 2.3% of gross domestic product in the July-September quarter. That was down from 2.4% in the second quarter. The deficit on the current account has tumbled from a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005.
The United States is now a net exporter of crude and fuel on a quarterly basis, helping to curb the import bill. It is set to achieve that coveted status for the first time on record on an annual basis in 2020, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said last week, the result of a production surge that has dramatically reduced the nation's dependence on foreign oil.
Goods exports decreased $0.9 billion to $413.8 billion in the third quarter. Goods imports fell $4.5 billion to $633.4 billion.
The Trump administration's ""America First"" policy, which has left Washington embroiled in a 17-month trade war with China as well as tit-for-tat tariffs with other trading partners, has reduced trade flows, resulting in a narrowing of the trade deficit.
The surplus on primary income - which includes investment income such as dividends and employee compensation - rose to $68.7 billion from $66.6 billion in the second quarter. Primary income receipts fell $4.1 billion to $282.0 billion, reflecting decreases in direct investment income and other investment income
The deficit on secondary income, which includes U.S. government grants, pensions, fines and penalties, and worker remittances, increased to $35.5 billion from $32.7 billion.
Dividends increased $24.9 billion to $95.3 billion in the third quarter, remaining elevated since last year's overhaul of the tax code, which slashed the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and generally eliminated taxes on repatriated earnings."

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Dec. 14, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Though the drop did not unwind the prior week's jump of 49,000, it likely does not indicate a material shift in labor market conditions as claims data tend to be volatile in the period following the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
The prior week's surge, which boosted claims to 252,000 - the highest reading since September 2017 - probably reflected a late Thanksgiving Day this year compared to 2018. That could have thrown off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 225,000 in the latest week. They expect claims to remain elevated relative to October's low reading given volatility in the data around the holiday season and end of the year.
The Labor Department said no claims for states were estimated last week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,500 to 225,500 last week. The underlying trend in claims remains consistent with a strong labor market.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of December's employment report.

Labor market strength is underpinning consumer spending, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global growth that have weighed on manufacturing.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 51,000 to 1.72 million for the week ended Dec. 7. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 6,250 to 1.68 million."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's central bankers all agreed to hold their key interest rate steady at 1.75% despite two months of protests that have hit economic growth and fueled uncertainty among investors and consumers, their meeting minutes showed on Thursday.
The bankers said they believed recently announced fiscal stimulus measures coupled with successive rate cuts in recent months would help bolster economic growth for 2020. This month it cut its gross domestic product forecast for next year to 0.5%-1.5% from a previous 2.75%-3.75%. [nC0N28F000]
The slide in the peso, which has hit historic lows in recent week, would help push long-lagging inflation in the South American nation to its target without further stimulus, they added. [nT5N22C01X]
Economic activity in October marked the biggest year-on-year contraction in a decade, it was confirmed earlier this month, as riots over inequality overtook the country. Forecasts for future growth and unemployment are equally dire.
The board agreed in its meeting, two days after the data was released, that it would likely refrain from cutting the rate for several months, maintaining a watching brief instead.
It said that the short-term disruption caused to economic activity by the protests had a knock-on effect on business and consumer confidence, share prices and the peso strength which could extend into the medium term.
The lack of certainty around political, social and economic issues would exacerbate the situation, the board said, adding: ""to avoid further adverse effects, new agreements should be reached as soon as possible"", or it would have to revise downwards its forecast for recovered growth in 2021 as well.
""If this is not achieved, the economy could remain weakened for several years,"" the board said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England kept interest rates steady on Thursday, saying it was too soon to gauge how much Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election victory would lift the Brexit uncertainty that has hung over the economy.
Two of the BoE's nine policymakers voted for a second month in a row for a cut to borrowing costs due to fears that Britain's jobs boom is deteriorating.
But the majority took a wait-and-see approach at the penultimate rate-setting meeting for Governor Mark Carney, who is due to stand down on Jan. 31.
""There was no evidence yet about the extent to which policy uncertainties among companies and households had declined following recent domestic policy developments,"" the BoE said in a statement.
Sterling rose and British government bond prices fell on the news that no further BoE policymakers had backed a rate cut.
""Effectively the Monetary Policy Committee has taken some heart from developments over the past month or so, namely that the outlook for Brexit now looks a bit clearer,"" Philip Shaw, an economist with Investec, said.
The BoE also thought the prospects for the global economy had improved as it noted a ""partial de-escalation"" of the U.S.-China trade tensions.
But Shaw said a BoE rate hike over the next year looked very unlikely.
After Johnson's emphatic election win last week, Britain is on course to leave the European Union on Jan. 31 with a transition deal, which the BoE said could reduce some of the immediate uncertainty hovering over businesses.
But many companies are already looking to the end of 2020, when they will face tariffs on exports to the EU unless Johnson succeeds in negotiating a trade deal before then - or breaks his word and allows an extension to the transition period.
7-2 SPLIT
At this week's BoE meeting, policymakers Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel once again voted to cut rates, saying the central bank needed to move quickly to respond to signs that Britain's robust job market was faltering.
For the seven others, it was too soon to take action. Economic growth was expected to pick up in early 2020 thanks to the easing of Brexit uncertainty, higher spending by the government and a recovery in global economic growth, they said.
""If global growth failed to stabilize or if Brexit uncertainties remained entrenched, monetary policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth and inflation,"" the statement said.
But further ahead, the BoE said it might need to raise borrowing costs ""at a gradual pace and to a limited extent"" if those risks did not materialize and the economy grew as expected.
Last month the BoE forecast Britain's economy would grow by just 1.2% next year, the weakest annual expansion since the global financial crisis.
On Thursday it cut its forecast for quarterly growth in the final three months of 2019 to 0.1% from 0.2%.
The BoE said there were further signs that Britain's recently booming jobs market was going off the boil, but unit labor costs were still growing at a pace that could push up inflation by more than it wants.
A small amount of excess supply had widened in the broader economy as companies were operating below full capacity.
Inflation is currently running below the BoE's 2% target at 1.5%. But a handful of economists think the central bank could raise rates next year due to underlying pressures from the tight labor market and damage to productive capacity from Brexit.
Most, though, think a rate cut is more likely and financial markets have been pricing in a roughly 50% chance of a single 25 basis-point rate cut before the end of 2020. That probability fell slightly after Thursday's announcement."
1613,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 07:02AM ET</span>",Breaking - Bank of England Holds; Sterling Rises,"Investing.com - The Bank of England said Thursday that it is keeping interest rates on hold at 0.75% after its final monetary policy meeting of the year.
In a repeat of last month’s vote, policymakers were split 7-2 in favor of no change, with Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel once again backing a rate cut.
Officials also voted unanimously to maintain the asset purchase scheme, which currently holds 435 billion pounds of government debt and 10 billion pounds of corporate bonds.
The bank said that it expects to see only marginal economic growth in the fourth quarter after gross domestic product increased by 0.3% in the three months to September, but added that the global economy is showing signs of stabilizing.
""Global growth has shown tentative signs of stabilising and global financial conditions remain supportive,"" the bank's statement said. ""The partial de-escalation of the US-China trade war provides some additional support to the outlook relative to the November Report, although trade tensions remain elevated.""
The bank stuck to its message that interest rates could move in either direction, saying it was too early to judge how material the effect of the breakthrough in U.S.-China trade talks and developments on Brexit would be on the U.K. economy.
The decision came after last week’s U.K. election results raised expectations for a smoother path to Brexit until Prime Minister Boris Johnson revived fears of a no-deal scenario.
Johnson has proposed plans to rule out any extension of the transition period beyond the end of 2020, meaning he will have just 11 months after the Jan. 31 Brexit deadline to reach a trade deal or risk exiting the European Union without trade arrangements in place.
Sterling was trading at $1.3125 immediately following the announcement from $1.3081 earlier, in the wake of two days of heavy losses that wiped out gains from the post-election relief rally - the ‘Boris Bounce’. The pound is still down more than 1.7% for the week and is on track for its largest weekly decline since late July.
Against the pound, the euro was trading at 0.8481 from 0.8515 immediately before the announcement.
The FTSE 100 gained 50 points on the decision to trade up 0.3% on the day, while the yield on the U.K. 10-year government bond rose three basis points to 0.82%.
Uncertainty over the potential economic fallout from Brexit prevented the BoE from following the lead of the Federal Reserve and raising interest rates in 2018.
It was then sidelined from a shift toward lower rates as other central banks, including the Fed and the European Central Bank, moved to counter the impact of the U.S.-China trade row on their economies.
Looking ahead to 2020, the BoE could cut interest rates, keep them on hold, or possibly even resume its long-delayed plan to raise them, depending on how Brexit plays out.
Investors are also waiting to see who will succeed BoE Governor Mark Carney, who is due to leave the central bank on Jan. 31. His replacement is expected to be announced soon.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 06:43AM ET</span>",Cautious UK shoppers send retail sales growth to 19-month low,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers kept a tight grip on their wallets last month as retail sales grew at their slowest annual pace since April 2018 amid uncertainty about Brexit and December's election.
Thursday's figures from the Office for National Statistics were collected before Black Friday sales promotions, but the ONS said it was confident the slowdown in year-on-year sales growth to 1.0% in November from October's 3.1% was not distorted by the timing.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller slowdown in growth, to 2.1%. 
Spending by shoppers had been supporting the overall economy for most of the time since 2016's Brexit referendum; Thursday's figures added to other signs of a slowdown in the run-up to last week's election. 
Excluding fuel purchases, retail sales growth was the weakest since October 2017. 
Retail sales in November were down 0.6% from October, and have now failed to show any monthly growth for four months in a row - the longest such run since at least 1996.
""All main sectors saw their sales fall with the exception of food stores,"" ONS statistician Rhian Murphy said.
Sterling fell briefly on the data, but most analysts are more focused on the political outlook.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's sweeping election victory has eliminated the risk of a disruptive no-deal Brexit on Jan. 31, removing some of the uncertainty hanging over the British economy.
But a hit to trade remains possible at the end of 2020, when Johnson insists a post-Brexit transition period will end, regardless of whether or not he can negotiate a trade deal with the European Union before then. 
This year, the November retail sales sample period did not include sales promotions in the days running up to Black Friday, which fell on Nov. 29, but the ONS said it was confident its seasonal adjustment process accounted for this. 
A fuller picture will be available once November's sales can be compared with December data.
""At face value, November's further drop in retail sales is pretty concerning,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
But he doubted whether the ONS methodology fully captured the effect of Black Friday not being included in November's data, and predicted a pick-up in December.
""Even so, given the falls in October and November, it will be very difficult for retail sales volumes to grow at all in Q4 as a whole. So not a very merry Christmas for retailers.""
A separate survey from the Confederation of British Industry suggested retail sales stabilized this month after months of decline.
""While stagnating sales volumes in December are hardly something to cheer about, the figures at least provide hope that the recent period of falling sales has passed,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said of its figures. 
Thursday's data come too late to influence the Bank of England's December interest rate decision, which is due for publication at 1200 GMT.

The BoE is expected to keep rates steady at 0.75%, but economists expect two policymakers - Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel - to vote again for a cut because of tentative signs of weakness in the job market.

1615,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 04:00AM ET</span>",Riksbank Hike Ends Subzero Experiment in Global Test Case,"(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on European markets? In your inbox before the open, every day. Sign up here.
Sweden’s central bank ended half a decade of subzero easing in a move that will provide relief to the finance industry and a test case for global counterparts experimenting with negative borrowing costs.
The Riksbank, once castigated by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman for what he called a “sadomonetarist” policy of tightening, is risking similar controversy again after it raised its key rate by a quarter point despite evidence of a slowing economy.
Governor Stefan Ingves downplayed the growth outlook in the lead-up to the decision with a focus on the harmful effects of negative policy -- in particular, the danger that ultra-low borrowing costs might stoke risky investing. He also insisted that the measure is designed to be temporary.
The Swedish increase on Thursday marks a turning point in the history of a policy pioneered in recent years by three other European economies as well as the Bank of Japan. The Riksbank had flagged the shift so well in advance that not one of the 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected anything else.
“Inflation has been close to the Riksbank’s target of 2% since the start of 2017, and the Riksbank assesses that conditions are good for inflation to remain close to the target going forward,” the bank said on Thursday. It also said that the repo rate is expected to remain at zero “in the coming years” and kept a goal of purchasing bonds through so-called quantitative easing until the end of 2020.
The krona was initially little changed against the euro, before gaining about 0.2% by 9:42 a.m. in Stockholm, with most market participants expecting the hike.
After Thursday’s hike, the market is unlikely to get much more excitement from the Riksbank, according to Johan Javeus, chief strategist at SEB in Stockholm. He tweeted that people should “expect highly expansive and highly boring Swedish monetary policy in the coming years!”
While policy makers have increased their so-called repo rate to zero, the Riksbank’s deposit rate remains in negative territory, though that facility isn’t the pivotal benchmark to borrowing costs in Sweden’s economy. The European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, Denmark’s central bank and the Bank of Japan are the remaining institutions currently sticking with subzero policy as a central plank of their monetary stance.
The Swedish move may be watched with intrigue by those counterparts seeking clues on how they might reverse their own negative interest rates in future, if the need arises.
Policy makers often use the measure to stimulate economic growth, in the hope that it provides an incentive to banks to lend money instead of hoarding it.
But ECB officials, whose own rate is now at minus 0.5% after a cut in September, increasingly emphasize the harmful impact of negative rates, from the squeeze on lenders’ profit margins to the threats posed to financial stability by incentivizing investments in riskier assets. A further cut, once seen likely for December, is now rarely threatened by policy makers.
By contrast, SNB President Thomas Jordan has robustly defended the tool and also says that Switzerland can’t be compared to Sweden. While his institution’s deposit rate, at minus 0.75%, matches Denmark’s as the world’s lowest, he refused to rule out further cuts in a newspaper interview published on Wednesday.
The removal of negative monetary policy in Sweden will alleviate pressure on the country’s banking system and investment industry. Richard Grottheim, the chief executive of AP7, which oversees more than $50 billion in assets from Stockholm, complained in an interview this week that the measure “created a strange situation in the rates market.”
The increase is still fraught with risks. While accelerating inflation gave policy makers a green light to tighten, Sweden’s export-focused economy is vulnerable to trade tensions and showing signs of slowing.
“The Riksbank’s commitment to a hike, at a time when Sweden has also been negatively affected by the global manufacturing-led slowdown, is sometimes seen as counter-intuitive,” Joao Almeida, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note this week. “However, from a cyclical standpoint, Sweden is an economy with a positive output gap and inflation not that far from target.”
If the tightening goes awry, the Riksbank might face the sort of criticism that accompanied the reversal of a previous tightening cycle that had begun in 2010. Policy makers split bitterly and the institution endured repeated public attacks by Krugman.
Former Swedish policy maker Lars E.O. Svensson, a critic last time round, has described the rate increase this month as “a similar mistake.”

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2019 12:12AM ET</span>","BOJ keeps policy steady, offers gloomier view on output","By Leika Kihara and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept monetary settings steady on Thursday and maintained its upbeat view on the economy, suggesting policymakers are in no hurry to boost stimulus even as global risks threaten a fragile recovery.
But the central bank offered a gloomier view on factory output than at its previous rate review in October, a nod to the widening fallout from softening global demand and the U.S.-China trade war.
The decision to stand pat keeps Japan in line with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have both signalled their respective monetary policies will be in a holding pattern for the time being.
""The BOJ will likely stand pat throughout next year given the Fed probably won't raise or cut interest rates, which should keep yen moves steady,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.
""For the time being, the BOJ will keep its fingers on the trigger to signal its readiness to ease. But it won't actually pull the trigger.""
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its short-term interest rate target at -0.1% and that for 10-year government bond yields around 0%.
The central bank also kept intact its assessment that Japan's economy continues to expand moderately as a trend.
""Industrial production is falling due mainly to natural disasters,"" the BOJ said in a statement announcing its policy decision, revising down its view from October when it said output was moving sideways.
The steady policy stance is partly underpinned by moves from the United States and China to secure a preliminary trade deal to de-escalate a bruising trade war, which has hit world growth.
""The main recognition is that exports and production are weak. As a result of the sales tax hike (in October), the domestic market is worsening. But the BOJ views that as a temporary matter, so it is postponing its judgement,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
RESTORING LIQUIDITY
At his post-meeting news conference, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is likely to repeat the bank's readiness to ease further if global risks threaten to derail Japan's economic recovery.
But many analysts say the hurdle for action is high given the strain prolonged ultra-low rates is heaping on financial institutions.
As part of efforts to ease the side-effects of its huge asset buying, the BOJ unveiled details of a scheme first flagged in April to lend some of its holdings of exchange-traded funds (ETF).
Aside from gobbling up government bonds to keep bond yields low, the BOJ also buys ETFs and other risky assets as part of its massive stimulus programme. Some investors have complained that the BOJ's huge buying was crowding out private traders and draining liquidity in the ETF market.
Koichi Hamada, a key economic adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, also criticised the BOJ's negative rate policy and warned against pushing borrowing costs down to a ""reversal rate,"" or a level that could do more harm than good by crippling financial institutions' ability to lend.
""Negative interest rates hurt, particularly smaller financial institutions' health, so the BOJ must try to avoid a situation where interest rates reach a level deemed as a reversal rate,"" he told Reuters earlier this week.
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, expanded an annualised 1.8% in the third quarter on resilient domestic demand and business spending.
But factory output suffered its largest fall in two years in October and big manufacturers' business sentiment sank to a near seven-year low in the fourth quarter, underscoring the fragile state of Japan's recovery.
Many analysts expect the economy to have contracted in the current quarter as a sales tax hike in October cools consumption."
1617,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 11:52PM ET</span>",Bank of Japan Keeps Policy Steady After Abe’s Fiscal Package,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Japan left policy untouched Thursday as a government stimulus package, progress in U.S.-China trade talks and signs of a bottoming of the global slowdown brightened the economic outlook.
The central bank maintained its target for interest rates and asset purchases, according to its statement Thursday, in line with the view of all 45 economist surveyed by Bloomberg.
The BOJ has now reached the end of a precarious year without having to delve deeper into its depleted ammunition despite a wave of easing by central banks when the global deceleration looked set to deepen sharply.
That wave has largely come to an end with the Federal Reserve pausing its interest rate cuts and new European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde signaling the worst is likely over for the eurozone’s economy.
The phase one U.S.-China trade deal, a stabilizing of global manufacturing readings and a stronger mandate for the U.K. to leave the European Union have given time for Governor Haruhiko Kuroda to assess how Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s $120 billion fiscal package will prop up growth in an economy contending with a sales tax increase, an export slump and destruction caused by a super typhoon.
While the BOJ no longer described overseas risks to the economy as increasing, it said they remained significant, signaling the board remains on guard.
BOJ officials see a sizable impact from Abe’s fiscal spending, which is expected to boost the economy by 0.35 percentage points, according to economists surveyed. The government Wednesday estimated Japan’s growth to be 1.4% in the year starting in April, increasing a likelihood that the BOJ will upgrade its projection of 0.7% in a quarterly report next month.
“The BOJ is off the hook,” said Shigeto Nagai, chief Japan economist at Oxford Economics in Tokyo ahead of the decision. “It’s a lot easier for the BOJ now. They will sit tight unless some unexpected shock hits the economy or market,” the former BOJ official said.
While keeping overall economic assessment, the BOJ downgraded its view of factory output after production dropped the most since a March 2011 tsunami and earthquake in October thanks to the typhoon and the tax hike. The bank raised its assessment of public investment after it helped prop up stronger-than-expected growth last quarter.
The BOJ maintained its forward guidance, saying it expected rates to remain low or lower as long as there was a chance of losing price momentum."

Britain's housing market has lost momentum since June 2016's referendum on leaving the European Union. During this time, prices fell in London and surrounding areas owing to a rise in property purchase taxes and concerns about Brexit, though modest growth continued in other parts of the country.
Despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson winning a large majority at last week's election, taking the risk of a no-deal Brexit off the table for Jan. 31, RICS said Brexit uncertainty was likely to resume, and weigh on prices and sales volumes.
""Challenges around affordability and low stock levels will continue to drag on the market, and Brexit uncertainty could resurface as the next deadline draws closer,"" RICS economist Tarrant Parsons said.
Johnson has vowed not to extend a post-Brexit transition period past the end of 2020, regardless of whether he can secure a trade deal with the EU to avoid economically damaging tariffs and checks on British goods from 2021 onwards.
RICS's forecast is similar to the average in a poll of economists conducted by Reuters last month, which predicts a 1.5% rise for 2020.
Separate data from the Office for National Statistics on Wednesday showed house prices in October rose by an annual 0.7% across the UK, the smallest increase in more than seven years.
RICS said rents were expected to rise further and at a faster pace by 2.5% overall and by 3% in London. The outlook for overall sales volumes is broadly flat."

The third quarter result was slightly improved from the second quarter rate of 10.6%.
On Tuesday, INDEC said that Argentina's economy shrank 1.7% in the third quarter versus the same period the previous year after markets and the peso currency tumbled in response to the shock results of the Aug. 11 primary election in which then-candidate Alberto Fernandez soundly beat conservative incumbent Mauricio Macri.
President Alberto Fernandez, who went on to defeat Macri in the Oct. 27 presidential elections, has vowed to emphasize growth as he takes on hardships in Latin America's #3 economy including higher unemployment, rising poverty and rampant inflation above 50%.
The new government announced in a decree over the weekend that Argentine workers fired without just cause over the next 180 days will be paid double the normal exit package, a change from the pro-business stance of the previous administration.
Young people were especially hard hit by unemployment, the government said, with young women suffering a jobless rate of 24%.
On Tuesday, the government sent a bill of economic measures to Congress that proposes raising taxes on agricultural exports and taxing foreign assets abroad as the government seeks funds to increase social spending."

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation remained at a three-year low in November, comfortably below the Bank of England's 2% target before its next interest rate announcement on Thursday, official data showed.
Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 1.5% for a second month running in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday, a little stronger than the median expectation for a 1.4% increase in a Reuters poll of economists.
The figures are unlikely to shift expectations that two of the Bank of England's nine monetary policy officials will again vote to cut rates this week, though political uncertainty in Britain has been reduced by the scale of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's victory in last week's election.
The BoE said last month that inflation would probably fall to 1.25% in early 2020 because of caps on energy and water prices, but was likely to be back above its 2% target in about three years' time.
The two officials who voted to cut rates at the November meeting cited signs of a cooling in Britain's labor market, and the Monetary Policy Committee as a whole sounded cautious about the outlook as the global economy slowed.
""With inflation well below target, little sign of underlying price pressures and GDP growth running below trend, an interest rate cut on Thursday shouldn't be completely ruled out,"" said Ruth Gregory, economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
""Even so, coupled with yesterday's robust labor market figures, the pressure on the (BoE) to cut interest rates at its meeting tomorrow appears to have eased somewhat.""
British government bond prices fell on the data.
The ONS said price rises for chocolate, concert tickets and package holidays were offset by falling hotel costs and a much smaller increase in cigarette prices compared with a year ago after a tax increase.
A measure of core inflation, which excludes energy, fuel, alcohol and tobacco, held at 1.7% in November, as expected.
The ONS figures also suggested less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.
The prices charged by British factories for their products rose 0.5% year-on-year in November, the smallest increase since July 2016.
Separate data from the ONS showed house prices in October rose by an annual 0.7% across the United Kingdom, the smallest increase in more than seven years, after a 1.3% rise in September.

Prices in London alone fell by 1.6%, the biggest drop since June.

German business expectations improved for a third month in December, a sign manufacturers are starting to see a way out of a yearlong downturn that’s left Europe’s largest economy deeply scarred.
It’s the first piece of encouraging news after a gauge of factory activity pointed to an unexpected worsening at the end of 2019, and the Bundesbank predicted growth will remain sluggish at least through 2020 as the impact of trade tensions, weaker global growth and political uncertainty only slowly wears off.
The Ifo Institute’s gauge rose the most since mid-2018 to 93.8, exceeding most estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The measure of the current situation rose, as did the overall business climate indicator.
Fledgling optimism among the 9,000 firms surveyed adds to assertions by the Economy Ministry as well as private investors that -- despite remaining risks -- Germany’s outlook is gradually getting brighter.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The expectations balance, the component we pay most attention to, posted another decent gain. Momentum is undoubtedly weak and growth fragile, but the survey data flow is consistent with our forecast for a modest acceleration in GDP growth in early 2020.”
-- Jamie Rush. Read the GERMANY REACT
The increase in sentiment, partly on the back of the U.S.-China trade agreement, is just the first step, and it may be some time before hard data follow. Both industrial production and factory orders dropped at the start of the fourth quarter.
The trade deal is “good news and probably one of the reasons companies become more optimistic,” Clemens Fuest, president of the Ifo Institute, said on Bloomberg Television,. “At the same time, many companies are still cautious, because we know U.S. commercial policy is very volatile.”
Last week, the European Central Bank lowered its projection for growth in the wider euro area next year. At the same time, President Christine Lagarde pointed to signs of stabilization and argued downside risks had become “somewhat less pronounced.”

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2019 05:11AM ET</span>","Strong housing, public building lift German construction sales to record highs","BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's construction industry expects record sales this year and next thanks to booming demand for housing and higher state spending on infrastructure, associations said on Wednesday.
The German economy, Europe's largest, is relying increasingly on robust domestic spending helped by record-high employment and strong demand in the construction sector as trade tensions and a global economic slowdown hit exports.
The construction boom is driven by higher state spending on roads and bridges, increased company investment in buildings and a real estate bonanza. It has also been encouraged by ultra-low interest rates, a growing urban population and high immigration levels over the past five years.
The ZDB and HDB construction associations said that nominal sales rose by 8.5% to 137.2 billion euros this year, surpassing levels last seen during a boom following unification and the economic upswing in East Germany in the mid-1990s.
For 2020, the associations forecast construction sales to grow by 5.5% to 145 billion euros, the highest level since German unification in 1990.
Sales in residential construction are expected to grow by 7 percent to 54.2 billion euros next year. Company investments are seen rising by 5.5 percent to 51.3 billion euros while state spending on roads and bridges is forecast to increase by 4 percent to 39.5 billion euros.
With construction prices expected to rise by 4.5 percent next year, however, overall sales in real terms are likely to grow by only 1 percent, the associations added.
Employment in construction rose by about 20,000 to 857,000 people this year, with a growing number of companies struggling to find skilled workers, they added. For 2020, companies expect to increase staff by 13,000 to 870,000.
The federal government has made available billions of euros for social housing, but the outflow of earmarked funds has been slow due to planning bottlenecks at local authorities and capacity constraints in the construction sector."

Inflation in the 19-country bloc was 1.0% year-on-year, up from 0.7% in October, in line with initial estimates Eurostat published on Nov. 29.
The acceleration came as unprocessed food prices rose 1.8% in November, from 0.7% in October. Energy prices were 3.2% lower, about the same decline as a month earlier.
The narrower inflation indicator, which strips out volatile energy and unprocessed food prices and is monitored closely by the European Central Bank, was revised to 1.4% from the previous estimate of 1.5%.
Excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, a measure on which many economists focus, inflation was also trimmed to 1.4% in November from the initial 1.5%."

The Ifo institute said its business climate index rose to 96.3 in December from an upwardly revised 95.1 in November. The December reading was the highest since June and beat a Reuters consensus forecast of 95.5.
""The German economy is heading into the New Year with more confidence"", Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement, adding that both companies' assessment on their current business conditions and outlook for the coming six months improved.
The figures suggest that the German economy grew by 0.2% in the fourth quarter, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters, adding that the industrial sector nonetheless remained in recession and would emerge only slowly from that downturn.
The German economy has been going through a soft patch as its export-oriented manufacturers struggle against a backdrop of trade disputes, a struggling car industry and uncertainties over Britain's planned departure from the European Union.
The economy expanded by just 0.1% in the third quarter, narrowly avoiding recession, which economists usually define as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
Ifo said manufacturers were more optimistic about their business outlook for the next six months, though their assessment of the current situation worsened a little.
The closely watched Ifo business climate index is based on surveys of around 9,000 firms in the manufacturing, service, trade, and construction sectors."

The Bank of Thailand's (BOT) monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to keep the one-day repurchase rate at 1.25%, a record low last seen during the global financial crisis.
The BOT trimmed its 2019 GDP growth forecast to 2.5% from 2.8% estimated in September and lowered its 2020 growth outlook to 2.8% from 3.3% on heightened external risks. Last year's growth was 4.1%.
Exports, a key driver of economic growth, are now expected to shrink 3.3% this year, compared with a 1% fall seen earlier. Next year's exports are expected to rise by a smaller 0.5%, rather than 1.7%.
""The Thai economy would expand below its potential and below the previous forecast, mainly as merchandise exports had contracted more than the previous assessment and were projected to recover more slowly than expected,"" the central bank said in a statement.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy is facing flagging growth, below-target inflation, a climbing baht, risks to financial stability and falling consumer confidence.
Capital Economics said in a research report that it expects the central bank to ease once more in this cycle, with rates being lowered to just 1.0% by early next year.
Thammarat Kittisiripat, economist at Tisco Group, also expected a further quarter-point cut next year, as he saw growth of just 2.6% next year and limited government spending.
The MPC committee said in a statement the current policy rate remains accommodative for growth and supports prices moving toward the central bank's target - currently 1-4%.
The central bank cut its forecasts for headline inflation in 2019 to 0.7% from 0.8% previously, and to 0.8% from 1.0% for 2020.
The BOT also expressed concern about the strength of the baht , Asia's best performing currency this year, which has risen around 7.6% against the U.S. dollar, putting further pressure on already weak exports.
All 16 analysts in a Reuters poll predicted no policy change.
In November, the MPC voted 5-2 to cut the rate by a quarter point after surprisingly delivering a similar reduction in August, the first easing since April 2015.
Thailand's economy expanded less than expected in the July-September quarter, as exports were weak..
To bolster the economy, the government this year launched $10 billion in stimulus plus additional steps, and the finance minister said more can be done if needed."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Confidence among Asian businesses rebounded sharply this quarter to hit an 18-month high with firms reporting a pickup in sales, though most are holding off on hiring as trade war uncertainty weighs, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey found.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index tracking firms' six-month outlook jumped 13 points to 71 for the fourth quarter. That lifted confidence from close to a decade low in the previous quarter to its highest since June last year.
The swing is also the strongest turnaround since the tail end of the eurozone debt crisis in 2011, when China was pouring stimulus into its economy as well. [ASIATOPCO/]
A reading above 50 means optimistic respondents outnumbered pessimists.
This quarter revealed a noticeable shift from neutral to optimistic, and showed the strongest reading on sales growth in a year. Yet the majority of firms are not yet confident enough to plan hiring.
""Conditions, expectations and some of the uncertainty has improved over the last quarter,"" said Antonio Fatas, economics professor at global business school INSEAD in Singapore, pointing to easing tensions between China and the United States.
""But I don't see this uncertainty disappearing, I think some of these tensions are going to stay with us maybe for years or decades.""
Respondents rated their chief risk as the Sino-U.S. trade war, which has been a regular feature in the survey for much of the past two years as the conflict has weighed on global growth.
A total of 102 companies responded to the survey, conducted in 11 Asia-Pacific countries where 45% of the world's population lives and almost a third of global gross domestic product is generated.
Participants included firms in industries as varied as automaking, tourism and energy, such as Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, Thai hotelier Minor International PCL and Australia's Oil Search Ltd.

READY TO REAP
The survey was conducted from Nov. 29 to Dec. 13, as Chinese and U.S. negotiators finalised a ""phase-one"" deal to reduce some tariff barriers.
The most recent International Monetary Fund global growth projections forecast the trade war will drag the world's economy to its slowest pace of expansion since the 2008-9 financial crisis.
""Although the external environment remains challenging, Minor is confident that we will be able to withstand such challenges,"" said Chaiyapat Paitoon, deputy corporate chief financial officer at Minor International.
The firm has sought to diversify, increasing its stake to control nearly all of Spain's NH Hotels Group last year, and has grown its food segment with the November purchase of a Korean fried chicken franchise in Thailand.
""We are putting in extra effort to remain at the forefront of consumers' minds, so we are ready to reap the benefit when the environment becomes more conducive,"" Paitoon said.
Elsewhere, there are already green shoots. After months of weakness, growth in China's industrial and retail sectors beat expectations in November, as government support propped up demand.
The chipmakers benchmark, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index - seen as a bellwether of the global economy since demand for chips is a reliable proxy for growth and consumption - hit an all-time high this week.
However the headline numbers remain subdued as protectionism bites, with China's economic growth, for example, at its slowest in about a generation.
""At least as far as next year is concerned, I think the caution is still pretty much warranted,"" said Howie Lee, economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore.
""We are not out of the woods yet ... but deeper into the decade I think the dynamics will change a little bit, assuming that this first wave of the trade war has fully blown over.""

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 09:24PM ET</span>","Japan's exports shrink for 12th month as U.S., China demand falls","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports slipped for a 12th straight month in November, as declining shipments to the United States and China hit the trade-reliant economy, raising the risk of a fourth-quarter contraction.
Official data released on Wednesday showed Japan's exports fell 7.9% year-on-year in November, a smaller decline than the 8.6% decline expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
However, it was the longest run of declines in exports since a 14-month stretch to November 2016 as shipments of cars and construction machinery to the United States and chemical products to China fell.
""Exports are quite weak. A recovery remained out in November even when looking at it on a volume basis,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
Exports in volume terms, which exclude the exchange rate impact, dropped 5.0% in the year to November, the largest fall since August and the fourth consecutive month of declines.
Japan's economy grew at a much faster pace than initially reported in the third quarter, data showed last week, thanks largely to improvements in business spending and private consumption.
But there are worries the third-quarter strength is masking widening cracks in the economy after the government went ahead with a nationwide tax hike in October, giving a big hit to corporate and household sentiment.
Japan's economy has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war between the United States and China this year, with increased protectionism and a related global slowdown hurting output and exports from the country.
Industrial output slipped at the fastest pace in nearly two years in October while retail sales and household spending slumped after consumers tightened their purse strings following the sales tax hike.
The Bank of Japan, however, is seen keeping monetary policy on hold at its two-day policy meeting ending on Thursday as progress in U.S.-China talks and a $122 billion fiscal package at home take some pressure off the central bank to support growth.
By region, exports to China, Japan's biggest trading partner, lost 5.4% year-on-year in November, down for the ninth month as shipments of chemicals and car parts declined.
Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's overall exports, dropped 5.7% in the year to November largely due to declining shipments of flat rollers to Thailand.
Japan's shipments to the United States declined for the fourth straight month, falling 12.9% in the year to November, hurt by reduced shipments of cars, construction machinery and car parts.
The weakness in U.S.-bound shipments is largely thanks to weak car sales as car and car parts, which account for about half of the exports to the United States, even as consumption and the world's top economy overall are doing well, said Itochu's Takeda.
""The U.S. and China have agreed on a Phase One Trade deal so it's likely tariffs ill be reduced and a worsening of tensions has been stopped,"" Takeda said.
He expects Japanese exports to the United States to stage a recovery in the coming months with U.S. capital spending set to rebound.
Under the trade agreement announced last week, Washington will reduce some tariffs on Chinese imports in exchange for Chinese purchases of agricultural, manufactured and energy products increasing by about $200 billion over the next two years.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe previously agreed his own limited trade deal with the United States, which was approved by Japan's parliament this month, clearing the way for tariff cuts next year on items including U.S. farm goods and Japanese machine tools.
The nation's overall imports sank 15.7% year-on-year, marking their biggest decline since Oct. 2016, and a larger fall than the median estimate for a 12.7% decrease. That was partly due to weakened consumption after October's sales tax hike, economists said.
That decline in imports led to a 82.1 billion yen trade deficit, smaller than the 369.0 billion yen shortfall seen by economists."
1628,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 01:09PM ET</span>",U.S. housing market regaining steam; manufacturing stabilizing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in November and permits for future home construction surged to a 12-1/2-year high as lower mortgage rates continue to boost the housing market and support the broader economy.
The economy's near-term prospects were also bolstered by other data on Tuesday showing a strong rebound in manufacturing production in November as the return of formerly striking General Motors' (N:GM) workers boosted automobile output. The data suggested the economy remained on a moderate growth path in the fourth quarter despite slowing consumer spending.
But the economy's improving fortunes could prove temporary. Boeing (N:BA) said on Monday it would suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January as fallout from two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drags into 2020. 
Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years could wreak havoc on supply chains, and offset some of the lift to business confidence from easing trade tensions. The production stoppage is expected to undercut manufacturing and exports, and ultimately crimp economic growth.
""The economy never seems to be fully out of the woods,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Housing starts rose 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.365 million units last month, with single-family construction racing to a 10-month high and activity in the volatile multi-family sector increasing for a second straight month. Data for October was revised higher to show homebuilding rising to a pace of 1.323 million units, instead of advancing to a rate of 1.314 million units as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts increasing to a pace of 1.345 million units in November.
Starts in the South, which accounts for the bulk of homebuilding activity, surged to the highest level since March 2007. But homebuilding in the Midwest tumbled, likely pulled down by unseasonably cold temperatures and snowstorms.
Overall housing starts jumped 13.6% on a year-on-year basis in November. Building permits increased 1.4% to a rate of 1.482 million units in November, the highest level since May 2007. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed, with Boeing shares declining.
LABOR, LAND SHORTAGES
The housing market is regaining momentum after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times this year, pushing down mortgage rates from last year's multi-year highs. A survey on Monday showed confidence among homebuilders jumped in December to the highest level since June 1999.
But scope for robust gains in the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of the economy, is limited as builders complained they are ""still underbuilding due to supply-side constraints like labor and land availability."" 
In addition to land and labor shortages, mortgage rates have backed up in recent weeks after the Fed signaled further rate cuts were unlikely. The U.S. central bank kept rates steady last week and indicated borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through 2020.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen to 3.73% from a year-low of 3.49% in early September, but is still below its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.
Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. It is expected to contribute to gross domestic product again in the fourth quarter.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Fed said manufacturing production rose 1.1% last month after dropping 0.7% in October. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing output increased 0.3%.
The rebound in manufacturing production suggests the factory downturn is probably close to running its course. Manufacturing output is still expected to contract in the fourth quarter. 
""This is a welcome shift after declines in three out of the four preceding months, but not the end of the struggles for manufacturing,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 2.4% to a rate of 938,000 units in November, the highest level since January. Single-family housing starts rose in the West and Northeast, but fell in the Midwest and the South.
Single-family housing building permits rose 0.8% to a rate of 918,000 units in November, the highest since July 2007. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment jumped 4.9% to a rate of 427,000 units last month. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes rose 2.5% to a rate of 564,000 units.
Though housing completions dropped 6.6% to 1.188 million units last month, there was a surge in the number of houses under construction. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to bridge the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction increased 1.0% to 1.170 million units in November, the highest level since April 2007. The inventory of multi-family housing units under construction was the highest since September 1974.

""We are still at least several more years from returning to historical averages of home building, but these numbers show not only more inventory for buyers, but also a small boost to the economy given the home building industry is ramping up,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2019 12:06PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings rise from 18-month low in October,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings rebounded from an 18-month low in October and layoffs declined sharply, which could ease some fears that demand for workers was ebbing.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand rose 235,000 to 7.27 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, on Tuesday. But the rise did not recoup all of the drop of 269,000 in September, which pushed vacancies down to their lowest level since March 2018.
Vacancies have been trending lower this year since hitting an all-time high of 7.63 million in late 2018. Job openings in October were led by the retail trade sector, which saw an increase of 125,000 unfilled jobs.
Vacancies in the finance and insurance industry rose by 56,000 jobs and there were an additional 50,000 open jobs in the durable goods manufacturing industry.
""The numbers should calm worries that employer demand for workers is drying up,"" said Julia Pollak, labor economist at ZipRecruiter. ""Rather than falling substantially, job openings now appear to have remained fairly stable for over a year."" 
The job openings rate increased to 4.6% in October from 4.4% in September. But hiring decreased by 187,000 jobs to 5.76 million in October, concentrated in the private sector. The hiring rate dipped to 3.8% from 3.9% in September.
October's rebound in job openings suggests job growth could remain solid after nonfarm payrolls surged by 266,000 jobs in November, the most in 10 months.
""This may be the beginning of the end of the decline in demand for workers,"" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Next year could see job openings start to grow once again.""
With the labor market on solid footing, the number of workers voluntarily quitting increased by 41,000 jobs to 3.51 million in October. The quits rate, was, however, unchanged at 2.3%. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence.
Layoffs dropped 202,000 to 1.77 million in November. Layoffs decreased in the accommodation and food services industry and other services, but rose in federal government as temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census completed their duties. The layoffs rate dipped to 1.2% from 1.3% in September."

The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that manufacturing production rose 1.1% last month after a downwardly revised 0.7% fall in October. Industrial output also rose 1.1% in November after a downwardly revised drop of 0.9% in October.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts, overall industrial production and manufacturing output in November rose 0.5% and 0.3% respectively.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast overall manufacturing output would rise 0.7% and industrial output would increase 0.8% in November. Production at factories still fell 0.8% in November on a year-on-year basis.
The United Auto Workers union reached a new four-year labor contract with General Motors (N:GM) in late October, ending a strike by about 46,000 workers with the No. 1 U.S. automaker.
The Fed's measure of the industrial sector comprises manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities.
There was a 12.4% jump in the production of motor vehicles and parts in November. Overall, production rose 2.1% for consumer goods and 1.7% for business equipment, the Fed said. Utilities output increased 2.9% compared to a decline of 2.4% in the previous month.
The manufacturing sector, which makes up about 11% of the U.S. economy, has been weakened by a 17-month trade war between the United States and China.
Last Friday, the world's two largest economies announced a ""Phase one"" agreement that reduces some U.S. tariffs in exchange for increased Chinese purchases of American farm goods.

LONDON (Reuters) - The number of people in work in Britain unexpectedly rose in the three months before the missed Oct. 31 deadline for Brexit, according to data which suggests the labor market was retaining some of its strength.
The number of people in employment rose by 24,000 to 32.8 million in the August-to-October period, bucking the median forecast for a drop of 10,000 in a Reuters poll of economists.
The employment rate hit an all-time high of 76.2% while the unemployment rate fell back to its lowest level since the three months to January 1975 at 3.8%.
""The larger-than-expected rise in employment in October suggests the labor market is not getting any worse and may have even started to turn around,"" said Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics.
The increase in jobs was driven by a rise in the number of self-employed workers and full-time staff, while the number of part-time employees fell. 
British government bond prices fell by a small amount as investors viewed the chance of a Bank of England interest rate cut next year as slightly lower. 
Britain's labor market has stayed strong even as the economy slowed following the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union. That is due in part to employers, who are uncertain about what Brexit will bring, hiring staff who can be laid off easily rather than making longer-term commitments to invest in equipment.
But there had been signs recently that the jobs boom was weakening. These prompted two interest-rate setters at the Bank of England to vote for a cut to borrowing costs last month, and they are expected to do so again this week.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week reduced some of the uncertainty hanging over the economy by winning a big majority in a national election, ending any doubts about whether Britain would leave the European Union on the new date of Jan. 31.
But nerves about Brexit could return soon. Johnson plans to pass a law ruling out any extension of the Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020, saying he is confident he will clinch a free trade deal with the European Union by then. 
There were some signs of caution among employers in Tuesday's data. Vacancies were the lowest since the three months to August 2017 at 794,000.
The Office for National Statistics also said average earnings rose by an annual 3.2%, the weakest increase in more than a year and slowing sharply from growth of 3.7% in the three months to September. The ONS attributed much of the slowdown, however, to high bonus payments in October 2018 which distorted the comparison.

Excluding bonuses, pay growth slowed less sharply to 3.5% from 3.6% in the three months to September and was above the Reuters poll forecast of 3.4%.

The Confederation of British Industry's gauge of manufacturing output over the three months to December fell to -16 from -9 in November, its weakest reading since September 2009.
Inflows of new work also deteriorated as the CBI's monthly order book balance fell to -28 from -26.
The survey of 289 manufacturers covered Nov. 22 to Dec. 11, just before Johnson chalked up a comprehensive victory in last Thursday's election.
Other surveys have also shown Britain's manufacturers have struggled in recent months against a global drop in demand, as well as uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the election.
""With manufacturers reporting that output is declining at a pace not seen since the financial crisis, alongside another month of softer order books, it is crucially important to rebuild business confidence in this sector,"" CBI deputy chief economist Anna Leach said.
""After three years of gridlock, the Prime Minister now has a clear mandate to govern. Businesses across the UK will want him to break the cycle of uncertainty,"" she added.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a trade surplus of 17 billion euros in October.

Vacancies fell below 800,000 for the first time in two years and wages grew at their slowest annual pace since 2018, the Office for National Statistics said Tuesday. Employment rose marginally, leaving the jobless rate unchanged.
With a victorious Boris Johnson promising to take Britain out of the European Union by the new deadline of Jan. 31, the hope is that the confusion that has hung over the economy -- and spread to the once resilient labor market -- will now begin to dissipate.
The uncertainty is far from over, however, as Britain and the EU face the task of striking a trade deal in just 11 months. The prime minister is set to raise the stakes by making it illegal to extend the proposed transition period, meaning the U.K. would crash out of the EU at the end of next year unless an agreement is reached.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 01:46PM ET</span>","U.S. consumers show greater demand for credit, rejection rates drop: NY Fed survey","(Reuters) - U.S. consumers showed greater appetite for loans this year - driven by stronger demand for mortgages amid lower rates - and they had an easier time accessing credit when compared to a year earlier, a survey from the New York Federal Reserve showed on Monday.
Applications for credit rose slightly this year compared to 2018, and rejection rates declined, according to the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations Credit Access Survey. Applications for any kind of credit rose to 45.8% on average in 2019 from 45.5% in 2018. Rejection rates dropped to 17.6% in 2019 from 19.9% in 2018.
The greater demand for credit was driven by consumers seeking to take advantage of lower borrowing rates to buy homes. Mortgage loan application rates rose to 7.9% this year from 7.1% in 2018. That corresponded with a drop in mortgage rates, with the 30-year fixed rate mortgage dropping to 3.73% as of Dec. 13, 0.9 percentage point lower than the same time last year, according to Freddie Mac. Most of those home buyers had strong credit, with credit scores higher than 680.

In contrast, applications for mortgage refinancing loans declined slightly to 8.0% this year from 8.3% in 2018. Auto loan application rates also dropped to 12.6% this year from 15.5% last year.
Overall, consumers who applied for new credit this year had an easier time accessing those loans. Rejection rates declined for credit cards, mortgages and mortgage refinance applications, the survey found. The main exception was auto loans, which saw rejection rates rise to an average 7.1% in 2019 from 6.1% in 2018.
The New York Fed polls consumers about their credit expectations every four months and publishes one annual release summarizing trends from the past year.
The study also examines the financial fragility of U.S. households. The perceived probability of facing a sudden expense of $2,000 in the next month rose to 33.6% in 2019 from 32.9% in 2018. But consumers also felt more confident in their ability to afford such a bill, with 69.8% of consumers saying they would be able to come up with $2,000, up slightly from 68.6% in 2018."

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index jumped 5 points to 76, the biggest monthly increase since the end of 2017, and the November figure was revised higher, according to data released Monday. The reading topped all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists that had called for 70.
The readings add to other brighter assessments of the economy on Monday. A Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey showed manufacturers in the state are growing more upbeat, with the gauge of the orders outlook rising to the strongest since February. Elsewhere, two surveys of U.S. factories and service companies suggested economic growth is holding up at a modest pace.

The December reading caps a 20-point gain for the index this year, the biggest since 2012, and bodes well for future construction as well as affordability. While housing starts have improved in recent months, the pace of construction still remains significantly below levels seen in the early 2000s. The lack of inventory, along with low mortgage rates, have driven up prices and limited growth in the home ownership rate among Americans.The NAHB’s gauge of the traffic of prospective buyers climbed 4 points to 58, matching the highest level since 1998; the index of current sales surged by 7 points to 84, the best reading since 1999.The latest data could signal a further strengthening in housing permits, which hit their fastest pace since 2007 in October.

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses endured their worst downturn since mid-2016 in the run-up to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's landslide election victory last week, according to a survey published on Monday.
The 'flash' early reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Purchasing Managers' Indexes (PMI) for Britain showed that the decline in both the services and manufacturing sectors accelerated unexpectedly in December.
The readings, which pushed up British government bond prices, suggested the world's fifth-biggest economy is on course to contract in the fourth quarter, survey compiler IHS Markit said.
However, the PMIs have previously overstated weakness in the economy.
""The latest decline in the ... PMIs is another stark reminder that the British economy is unlikely to be on the cusp of a sharp turnaround after last week's election result,"" said James Smith, an economist at ING.
Other economists were more upbeat.
Samuel Tombs at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics said quarter-on-quarter growth could reach 0.4% in early 2020 as companies recommit to investment projects in light of the decisive election result. 
Johnson, bolstered by a majority of 80 seats in parliament, has said he will increase government spending and that approval of his Brexit plan will end uncertainty and boost investment by the private sector.
But he will have less leeway to loosen the government's purse strings than previously thought. 
Britain's budget forecasters said on Monday that changes to the way statisticians measure borrowing would add about 20 billion pounds ($26 billion) a year to the budget deficit. 
(Graphic: UK PMI survey veers further into BoE rate cut territory - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/1/645/641/Annotation%202019-12-16%20111550.png)
The composite PMI, which combines the services business activity and services and manufacturing output readings, fell to 48.5 from 49.3, its lowest level since July 2016, just after the Brexit vote. 
Readings below 50 denote contraction.
IHS Markit said the bright spot in its survey came from gauges of future sentiment, rather than movements in new orders or output.
This is only the second month for which IHS Markit has released flash PMIs for Britain. November's flash estimates were revised up significantly when final data came out.
The flash PMI for the dominant services sector fell to 49.0 in December from 49.3 in November, its lowest level since July 2016. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to an improved reading of 49.5.
The manufacturing PMI dropped to 47.4 from 48.9 -- again weaker than forecast -- as a stockpiling drive before the aborted Oct. 31 Brexit deadline evaporated. The survey's gauge of factory output fell to its lowest level since July 2012.

The data was collected between Dec. 5 and Dec. 12, the day of the election. Final versions of the manufacturing and services PMIs will be released on Jan. 2 and Jan. 6.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2019 06:32AM ET</span>",German economy stagnating despite signs of industrial rebound: ministry,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy is more or less stagnating, the economy ministry said on Monday, adding there are initial signs that an industrial recession could be coming to an end as orders stabilize.
The ministry also said in its monthly report that indicators at the start of the fourth quarter pointed to subdued private consumption even though disposable incomes continued to rise.
Consumption has helped keep Europe's biggest economy humming by compensating for weak exports. Trade tensions this year pushed the German manufacturing sector into a recession but the overall economy narrowly escaped the same fate.
""Industrial production has probably not reached the trough,"" the ministry said. ""But orders and sales have stabilized at a low level. This suggests that industry has gradually stabilized and could pick up slightly in the New Year.""
There are fears that should the manufacturing sector continue to shrink, the slowdown could spread to an otherwise resilient services sector.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December on Monday confirmed the diverging trends: manufacturing activity slipped and services rose.
Markit said the rate of decline in new orders and exports was stabilizing, giving hope for the manufacturing sector.
The German central bank said last week that Germany faced another sluggish year despite a likely rebound in exports as households see their spending power shrink. The Bundesbank said households' real disposable income fell due to a slowdown in employment growth.
It trimmed its growth forecast for this year to 0.5 percent and halved its prediction for 2020 to 0.6 percent. 

In another grim sign for the economy, the BGA trade association said on Monday that wholesalers planned to cut investments and their tendency to hire new staff had decreased despite expectations that their nominal revenue will rise by 2.3 percent to 1.3 billion euros this year.

IHS Markit's Euro Zone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, stayed at 50.6 in December, a touch below a median 50.7 predicted in a Reuters poll. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
The private sector business report published on Monday suggests the risks to the euro zone outlook remain skewed to the downside, despite Christine Lagarde's more upbeat tone in her first news conference as head of the European Central Bank.
The euro zone's industrial sector has struggled throughout the year, with manufacturing activity contracting for the 11th month in a row in December. The factory PMI fell to 45.9 from 46.9, below the 47.3 predicted in a Reuters poll.
The bloc's dominant service industry grew a bit faster, however, with that PMI rising to a four-month high of 52.4 from 51.9, above the 52.0 predicted in a Reuters poll.
""The big picture is of an economy showing some stabilization in activity -- but today’s drop in the manufacturing PMI is yet another useful reminder that the bloc's manufacturing sector is far from being out of the woods,"" wrote Nicola Nobile, economist at Oxford Economics, adding that the data are consistent with just 0.1% economic growth in the fourth quarter.
""While there are some tentative signs of improvement in new orders, the euro zone labor market is slowing down, with job creation that has almost ground to a halt at its lowest levels for over five years,"" Nobile wrote.
There was no reaction to the data in financial markets, which were instead focused on news of a preliminary trade deal agreed between the United States and China.
Among the euro zone's two largest economies, Germany's business activity contracted for a fourth month running, while in France, it grew at a steady pace so far in December despite a nationwide strike.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, fell to 45.9 from 47.4, also marking the 11th month of contraction. New factory export orders were still shrinking, but showed a slowing in the rate of decline.
""We project gradual acceleration from next year, with the ECB on hold, supporting the recovery,"" noted economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) who called the PMI data ""weak, but hopeful."""

Just when German factories appeared to be exiting a year-long slump that battered the country’s economy, the sector’s contraction has worsened again.
IHS Markit’s Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing unexpectedly fell to 43.4 in December, defying economists’ estimates that the number would pick up. The weakness more than offset growth in the services sector, keeping the private sector in contraction for a fourth straight month.
The euro pared its advance against the dollar and was up 0.1% at $1.1133 as of 09:34 a.m. Frankfurt time.
The data “point to a weak end to a difficult year for the German economy,” said Phil Smith, an economist at IHS Markit. “Manufacturing continues to weigh heavily on private sector output” even though slower declines in new orders and exports “provide glimmers of hope.”

The jump in transactions comes as Singapore grapples with an oversupply of almost 32,000 apartments -- some finished, others under construction and still more in the planning phase. The glut, which threatens to push down prices, has prompted home builders to call for an easing of cooling measures imposed in July 2018 to absorb the backlog.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's industrial and retail sectors beat expectations in November, as government support propped up demand in the world's second-largest economy and amid easing trade hostilities with Washington.
The set of upbeat figures released on Monday follow firm signs of progress in Sino-U.S. trade negotiations over the weekend after the world's two largest economies announced a ""phase one"" trade deal that would nearly double U.S. exports to China.
However, growth in infrastructure and the property sector, both key growth drivers, remained lackluster in November, underlining key challenges for Beijing in its efforts to stabilize economic performance next year.
Industrial production rose 6.2% year-on-year in November, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, beating the median forecast of 5.0% growth in a Reuters poll and quickening from 4.7% in October. It was also the fastest year-on-year growth in five months.
""Activity and spending indicators strengthened across the board last month, though we think this uptick will prove short-lived,"" said Martin Lynge Rasmussen, China Economist at Capital Economics.
""Admittedly, the phase-one U.S.-China trade deal could boost both export activity and corporate investment in the near term. But real estate, a key prop to growth in recent quarters, is primed for a moderation as financing to the sector is being squeezed by a regulatory crackdown.""
Cement, crude steel and pig iron production all rose from a year earlier in November, compared with a fall in the previous month. Output growth in steel, auto and telecommunications sectors accelerated from October.
The strong industrial figures aligned with the surprising improvement seen in other factory indicators in November, including purchasing managers indexes, which suggested government support is helping domestic demand, even as exports and producer prices shrank.
Japanese construction machinery maker Komatsu Ltd (T:6301) said its machine usage hours in China rose for the first time in eight months in November, echoing the trends seen in the PMIs.
Retail sales rose 8.0% year-on-year in November, compared with an expected 7.6%, buoyed by stimulus measures and the November Singles Day shopping extravaganza, the statistics bureau said.
The United States and China on Friday cooled their 17-month long trade war, which has roiled financial markets, hit global exports and disrupted supply chains.
The ""phase one"" agreement was first flagged by U.S. President Donald Trump in October but fuller details of the agreement only emerged over the weekend.
MIXED SIGNALS
The recent positive developments remove some clouds from China's economic outlook and also mitigate the immediate need for stimulus to support ambitious growth targets.
China's economic growth cooled to 6.0% in the third quarter, a near 30-year low, but policymakers have been more cautious about growth boosting measures than in past downturns.
Oxford Economics on Monday raised its 2020 growth forecast for China to 6.0% from 5.7% ""following signs that growth has stabilized"" and said significant policy easing was less likely, given Beijing's desire to ""keep its powder dry.""
However, that would still mark a likely moderation in growth. China plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6% in 2020 from this year's 6-6.5%, relying on increased state infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown, policy sources said.
Fixed asset investment showed few signs of improvement, growing 5.2% from January-November, in line with the increase seen in the first 10 months, which was the weakest in decades. 
Infrastructure investment growth, a key driver of activity, slowed to 4.0% in January-November from 4.2% in the first 10 months. 
As Beijing seeks to avert a sharper economic slowdown, policymakers have brought forward 1 trillion yuan ($142.07 billion) of the 2020 local government special bonds quota, used to finance infrastructure projects, to this year.
China will keep economic policies stable while making them more effective in 2020 to help achieve its annual growth target, state media reported last week following a top economics meeting.
Soft patches were also seen in the property sector, once a bright spot in the economy.
Real estate investment growth marked its weakest pace in nearly a year while new home prices rose at their slowest pace in nearly two years in November.

1647,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2019 11:25PM ET</span>",China November home price growth slowest in two years; property investment at one-year low,"By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's new home prices grew at their weakest pace in nearly two years in November while property investment also eased, with tightening policies continuing to cool the market even as some local easing is expected to prevent a sharp slowdown.
The property market, which directly impacts more than 40 industries, is a key growth driver for China as policymakers try to revive the ailing manufacturing sector and restore flagging consumer confidence amid a bruising trade war with the United States.
Average new home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 0.3% in November from the previous month, lower than the 0.5% growth reported in October and the weakest since February 2018, Reuters calculated from official National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data on Monday.
On an annual basis, average new home prices in the 70 cities rose 7.1% in November, down from 7.8% in October and the slowest year-on-year pace since August 2018.
Most of the 70 cities surveyed still reported monthly price increases for new homes, but the number was down to 44 from 50 in October.
China has clamped down on property speculation since 2016 to stop prices rising too quickly. It has tightened domestic and onshore financing for the sector, and kept down-payment requirements high for individual buyers.
Analysts noted some developers will likely ramp up sales promotions and slash prices toward the end of this year to secure revenue, though a drop in home prices would likely not be tolerated by local governments keen to maintain market stability.
Price trends have remained mixed, with some cities showing signs of rapid cooling while others remain vulnerable to overheating.
Price growth in China's four top-tier cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou - rose 0.6% from a month earlier, quickening from a 0.1% gain in October, the statistics bureau said in a statement accompanying the data.
Tier-2 cities, which include most of the larger provincial capitals, increased 0.2% in November on a monthly basis, compared with a 0.5% gain in the previous month.
Tier-3 cities rose 0.5%, slower than October's pace.
Separately, official data on Monday also showed China's real estate investment in November grew 8.4% from a year earlier, down from October's 8.8% and the weakest pace in nearly a year.
Property sales by floor area, a key barometer of demand, rose 1.1% on year in November, the lowest since June when transactions fell 2.2%, Reuters calculations showed.
The month also saw new construction starts measured by floor area declined 2.9% from a year earlier, the worst data seen in more than two years. That compared with a jump of 23.2% in October.
Funding pressure is likely to persist. More than 450 property developers went bankrupt as at the end of November this year, topping the total number last year, state-run Economic News Daily reported, citing market data.
""Developers normally are less active in kicking off new projects towards the end of a year, instead they focus more on promoting sales to collect cash to embellish their financial statements,"" said Hui Jianqiang, a researcher with China Real Estate Appraisal.
""We expect new construction to recover somewhat in spring next year as weather gets warm, but pessimistic sentiment in the market would remain as there's no sign of a broader loosening in policy.""
Chinese top leaders last week reiterated that ""homes are for living, not for speculation"".
But particularly as the economy slows, policymakers are increasingly mindful not to sink the market entirely - a pillar for the broader economy.
Some local governments in the past months moved to relax rules by making it easier for graduates to get coveted household registration permits or lowering the requirements for eligible home buyers, with an aim to prop up the cooling property market.
Last week, a city in Jiangsu province reversed a decision to remove a ban on property resale imposed more than two years ago. The removal of the ban - which lasted just a day - briefly fanned speculation that more cities could follow suit.
Such attempts to ease restrictions point to the pressure on local governments to shore up slowing real estate, while not appearing to running counter to the central government's war on speculative buying.
China's house prices are expected to grow 3.1% next year, the lowest over a calendar year since 2015, a Reuters poll showed, with tightening policies continuing to cool the market.
""A key headwind will come from property construction, which looks set to slow as the flurry of projects that broke ground a couple of years ago are completed,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist with Capital Economics, said in a note last week, predicting property controls will remain in place next year.
""To avoid this, the pace of new housing starts would have to jump. That seems unlikely barring a wholesale loosening of property controls."""

The data show that efforts to brake the slowdown in the economy may finally be taking root, after a year in which the long-term deceleration in output was exacerbated by uncertainty overseas and weak demand at home.“The data look all good at first glance,” said Betty Wang, senior economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “But there are no evident signs that the sluggishness is turning around” she said, pointing out that the rebound in retail sales is probably due to a one-off factor, such as the Singles Day promotion, and that improvement in industrial production might be because of quarter-end spikes.For 2020, the nation’s leaders said last week that they want to prioritize stability and keep growth within a “reasonable range.” Fiscal policy should be more proactive and effective, while prudent monetary policy should be “flexible and appropriate,” according to a statement released after the Central Economic Work Conference.On Friday, China and the U.S. announced they’d come to a preliminary trade agreement, staving off higher tariffs this month. That might bring some certainty to business and encourage investment.However, the promised reductions in tariffs are unlikely to take effect until February at the earliest and that may postpone the real-world impact.

Treasury lowered its forecast budget surplus for the 12 months through June 2020 and the following three fiscal years as it scaled back the estimated tax take over the period, according to its 2019-20 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook released in Canberra Monday.
Economic and wage growth forecasts this fiscal year have been lowered and forecast unemployment increased, reflecting growth that has failed to reach even 2% so far this year. While the government is still forecasting surpluses across the forward estimates, they’re thinner than before and it wouldn’t take much to knock them into deficit. If the government does manage to return the books to the black, it would be the first time since before the 2008 global financial crisis.
The forecasts contain “significant revenue writedowns on the back of sustained global and domestic economic headwinds,” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said in a statement.
Frydenberg has dismissed concerns about the slowing economy and resisted calls for additional spending to support growth. His stance flies in the face of a growing global chorus calling for looser fiscal policy, most recently with government stimulus programs announced in New Zealand and Japan. Instead, he’s sticking to a traditional conservative government playbook of trying to pay down debt to demonstrate his economic credentials."
1650,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2019 07:36PM ET</span>","Japan December factory activity shrinks for eighth month, output slump worsens: flash PMI","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory activity extended its fall in December as a prolonged decline in output and new orders threatened to tip the economy into contraction in the current quarter.
The Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edged down to a seasonally adjusted 48.8 from a final 48.9 in the previous month.
The index stayed below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for an eighth month.
If the final reading due early next year also shows a contraction, it will mark the longest such run since a nine-month stretch to February 2013.
The key output and new orders indicators have remained in contraction for the entire year, indicating prolonged strains in factory activity.
New export orders shrank for a 13th month, though they showed signs of bottoming out as the pace of decline was the slowest in a year.
The decline in manufacturing poses a growing headache for policymakers counting on robust demand at home to prop up slowing growth, with consumer spending taking a hard hit from October's sales tax hike.
Separate data showed activity in Japan's services sector improved for a second month in December, but the rise was too small to make up for the slump in manufacturing activity.
""The most disconcerting takeaway from fourth quarter survey data has been the marked loss of momentum in the service sector,"" said Joe Hayes, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""It is now clear that the service sector is unable to offset the industrial weakness, which does not bode well for growth prospects in 2020.""
Policymakers have already taken steps to address the rising outlook risks, with the cabinet approving a $122 billion fiscal package to support stalling growth in the world's third-largest economy.

Rightmove said asking prices, which are not seasonally adjusted, fell by 0.9% on a monthly basis after a bigger-than-normal 1.3% drop in November.
The figures follow British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's landslide victory in a national election last week in which he won a majority in parliament that surpassed the expectations of most analysts and investors.
""With much of the political uncertainty removed, we expect that the number of properties for sale will recover as more new sellers come to market, making up some of this year's lost ground,"" Rightmove director Miles Shipside said.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's economy activity grew 2.09% year-on-year in October, the government said on Sunday, helped by stirring domestic demand and a slight recovery in mining.
The expansion was below forecasts from a Reuters survey, which estimated 2.6% growth for the month. It was also slower than September's 2.22% growth and a 4.12% expansion in October last year.
The state statistics agency INEI said in a statement that the local economy grew by 2.16% in the first 10 months of the year and by 2.64% in the twelve-month period to October.
Economic growth was helped by commerce, construction and agriculture, while higher volumes in zinc, iron, lead and silver helped the important mining and hydrocarbons sector edge up after a weak showing the previous month.
Peru is the world's no. 2 producer of copper and zinc.
""The recovery of the advanced indicators of economic activity anticipates higher growth rates in November and December,"" the economy and finance minister said.

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 01:30PM ET</span>",Lackluster U.S. retail sales dim fourth quarter economic growth outlook,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in November as Americans cut back on discretionary spending despite a strong labor market, raising fears the economy was slowing a bit faster than anticipated in the fourth quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday bucked a recent raft of fairly upbeat data on the labor market, housing, trade and manufacturing that had suggested the economy was growing at a moderate speed in spite of headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global growth.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates steady and signaled that borrowing costs were likely to remain unchanged at least through next year amid expectations the economy would continue to grow modestly and the unemployment rate remain low.
""Just as the Fed was in the middle of a victory dance, convinced they have returned the economy to a position of strength after just three rate cuts, the consumer waves a red flag,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. ""Any signs the consumer is waning could have sizeable negative consequences for growth at year-end and into next year.""
Retail sales rose 0.2% last month. Data for October was revised up to show retail sales increasing 0.4% instead of climbing 0.3% as previously reported.
November's sales gains were meager despite reports from retailers of brisk Black Friday business. Some economists blamed a late Thanksgiving this year compared to 2018, which pushed Cyber Monday shopping into December. The late Thanksgiving could also have thrown off the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data, holding back sales.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would accelerate 0.5% in November. Compared to November last year, retail sales increased 3.3%.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales edged up 0.1% last month after rising by an unrevised 0.3% in October. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy.
Even accounting for the Thanksgiving-related distortions, retail sales have slowed considerably after rising by an average of 0.7% per month in the first eight months of this year. Economists believe sales are cooling as wage growth has stalled despite the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century.
""As we have been asking, is this just noise or an early sign that cracks in the strong consumer story are starting to form?"" said Michelle Girard, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut. ""We are watchful it is the latter.""
Consumer spending grew at a 2.9% annualized rate in the third quarter. November's slim gain in core retail sales left economists to expect that consumer spending would rise at around a 2.0% rate in the fourth quarter. But slowing consumer spending is boosting inventories at retailers, which could limit the downside to fourth-quarter GDP growth.
EBBING TRADE TENSIONS
In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.7% in October after rising 0.2% in September.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter now range from as low as a 1.3% rate to as high as a 2.0% pace. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter.
Economists did not expect a de-escalation in trade tensions between the United States and China to materially change the outlook for the economy in 2020, arguing that it would take a long time to reverse the damage caused by the 17-month trade war on sectors like manufacturing and agriculture.
President Donald Trump and Chinese officials said on Friday they had agreed to a ""phase one"" trade deal that included cutting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed in volatile trade, with investors confused on the status of the U.S.-China deal. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose.
""It is unlikely that the so-called phase one agreement with China will change things significantly in the short run,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""There is little expectation that the next phase, where the real deals are supposed to be made, will happen and, if they do, when that would be the case.""
Last month, auto sales increased 0.5% after rising 1.0% in October. Higher gasoline prices lifted receipts at service stations by 0.7%. Online and mail-order retail sales increased 0.8% after advancing 0.6% in October.
Sales at electronics and appliance stores increased 0.7%. Receipts at building material stores were unchanged and sales at clothing stores fell 0.6%. Spending at furniture stores edged up 0.1%. Americans cut back on spending at restaurants and bars, with sales falling 0.3%. Receipts at healthcare and grooming stores also fell. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores dropped 0.5%.
A third report from the Labor Department on Friday showed imported inflation remained subdued in November. Import prices increased 0.2% last month, lifted by higher prices for petroleum products, after declining 0.5% in October.
Import prices exclude tariffs. Last month's increase in import prices was in line with economists' expectations. In the 12 months through November, import prices decreased 1.3% after dropping 3.0% in October."
1656,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 13, 2019 09:37AM ET</span>",U.S. Retail Sales Miss Forecasts as Restaurants Decline,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales missed forecasts calling for an acceleration in November as clothing stores and restaurants posted declines, signaling the economy’s main engine may cool in the fourth quarter by more than previously thought.
The value of overall sales climbed 0.2% after an upwardly revised 0.4% increase the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 0.5% increase.
Sales in the “control group” subset increased a below-forecast 0.1% following a 0.3% gain. The measure excludes food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations, providing a reading considered more reflective of underlying consumer demand.
The data suggest a slowdown in business investment and weakness in manufacturing is weighing more broadly on Americans’ willingness to spend, which could mean a soft holiday-shopping season despite a relatively strong labor market, improved wage gains and record stock prices. At the same time, consumers likely still have enough wherewithal to support the expansion, and an easing of U.S.-China trade tensions should aid the economy in 2020.
Bloomberg News reported Thursday that President Donald Trump signed off on a phase-one trade deal with China, averting the Dec. 15 introduction of a new wave of U.S. tariffs on about $160 billion of consumer goods from the Asian nation, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. stock futures fluctuated Friday morning after a CNBC report saying China still has concerns about targets for agricultural purchases.
Other early indications for the holiday shopping season were more optimistic, with BofA Global Research reporting retailers had the highest sales gains for the period up to Black Friday since 2013.
Online sales were a strong element of Friday’s report. Sales at nonstore retailers, which includes e-commerce, rose 0.8% from the prior month, the biggest gain since August. They’re up 11.5% from a year earlier, though that’s down from October’s increase.
A Bloomberg survey this month showed growth in consumer spending was expected to ease to a 2.1% pace in the fourth quarter, from 2.9% in the prior three months. Control-group sales have increased a paltry annualized 1.3% over the latest three months, down from 3.4% in the three months through October.
Even so, the weakness in consumer spending -- which accounts for two-thirds of the economy -- is likely not dire enough to spur the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted in a press conference this week that consumer confidence remains elevated and that spending is healthy, with policy makers expecting to hold interest rates steady through the end of 2020. Last week’s jobs report for November showed payroll gains topped all economist estimates.
The retail sales report showed eight of 13 major categories increased, with solid gains in autos and electronics and appliance stores.
Among declines, sales at health and personal care stores dropped by the most in almost a year, while receipts at apparel and sporting goods and hobby stores also fell. Restaurants posted a 0.3% drop, also the largest in almost a year.
Filling-station receipts increased 0.7%, the report showed. The retail figures aren’t adjusted for price changes, so sales could reflect changes in gasoline costs, sales, or both. Separate data on the consumer price index this week showed that gasoline prices rose 1.1% in the month, which could have boosted these figures.
Excluding automobiles and gasoline, retail sales were little changed, following a 0.2% gain the previous month.
The sales data don’t capture all household purchases and tend to be volatile from month to month. Personal-spending figures will offer a fuller picture of U.S. consumption in data due Dec. 20.
A separate Labor Department report Friday added to signs of muted inflation pressures in the economy. The U.S. import price index rose 0.2% in November from the prior month, matching forecasts, and fell 1.3% from a year earlier. Excluding petroleum, the index was also up 0.2% from the prior month."

WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in November as Americans cut back on discretionary spending, which could see economists dialing back economic growth forecasts for the fourth quarter.

The bank lowered its benchmark interest rate to 6.25%, according to a statement published on Friday, taking the total reduction this year to 150 basis points. The move was forecast by 26 out of 33 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Four had predicted a hold and three expected a deeper move.
The cuts have so far failed to stoke inflation, which fell well below the bank’s 4% goal last month, while economic growth has also lagged behind the government’s goals. Easing is eroding one of the highest real yields in emerging markets, potentially drawing a line under a rally that spurred $16 billion of inflows into ruble government bonds this year.
Russia is following central banks in Turkey and Ukraine in reducing borrowing costs this week after the Federal Reserve signaled it is in no rush to reverse its three recent rate cuts. Optimism about a trade deal between the U.S. and China is helping to create a rosier backdrop for emerging-market central bankers.

Sentiment among Japan’s biggest product makers slid to 0 from 5, according to the quarterly Tankan survey released Friday. Economists forecast a reading of 3. Confidence has now weakened for four consecutive quarters, with the drop to zero indicating there are now as many pessimists as optimists.
The results of the survey, which are mainly from the last half of November, reveal the depth of concern among large manufacturers at that time about business conditions amid an uncertain global outlook and the fallout from October’s sale tax hike and a destructive typhoon.
But the report also contained some positives. Sentiment at large companies outside the factory sector held up better than expected and capital spending plans actually edged up from the previous quarter.
Key Insights
“The results show companies are cautious about the impact of the tax hike,” said Hiroshi Miyazaki, a senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), noting larger-than-expected falls in recent consumption data. The U.S.-China trade negotiations were also compounding their outlook, he added.Still, resilience in the service sector suggests the damage from the global slowdown is still largely contained to Japan’s manufacturers. The service industry has been a key prop for overall growth in the economy this year.Longer term, there are reasons for optimism. Along with signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, the stimulus package launched last week by the Abe administration has raised Japan’s growth prospects for next year, even if the situation in the current quarter remains challenging.Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the economy will shrink by an annualized 2.6% this quarter, as the higher sales tax crimps consumer spending and production contends with a continued global slowdown and October’s super typhoon.Around 70% of businesses had responded to the survey by Nov. 27, according to the BOJ, long before the government’s announcement of the 13.2 trillion yen ($122 billion) of fiscal stimulus, though it was known a package was in the pipeline.“Capital spending remains strong and that means the BOJ can still stick to its view for a moderate recovery,” said economist Hideo Kumano at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. “It’s likely that the BOJ will stand pat next week.”What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“Our view is that business activity is likely to slow. The sales-tax hike has piled more pressure on companies, and a contraction in the economy looks certain in 4Q.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' business mood sank to a near seven year low in the fourth quarter, a closely watched central bank survey showed, as the U.S.-China trade war and soft global demand weighed on the export-reliant economy.
Companies expect conditions to remain unchanged or even worsen three months ahead, the Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" quarterly survey showed, suggesting that the fallout from the trade conflict could hurt broader sectors of the economy.
But there were some bright signs. Non-manufacturers' sentiment appeared to weather the hit from October's sales tax hike with companies maintaining robust capital expenditure plans, reinforcing market expectations the BOJ will hold off on expanding stimulus at next week's rate review.
""The tankan suggests that the economy is slowing rather than collapsing so the BOJ is unlikely to cut interest rates at next week's meeting,"" said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment stood at 0 in December, down from plus 5 in September and worse than a median market forecast of plus 2, the tankan showed on Friday.
It marked the fourth straight quarter of decline and hit the lowest reading since March 2013, a month before BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda deployed his ""bazooka"" monetary stimulus to pull Japan out of deflation.
Underscoring the pain from the trade war, an index gauging big automakers' sentiment turned negative for the first time in more than three years.
Some steel and cement makers also saw demand ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games peak, a BOJ official told reporters.
""The weakness in automakers' sentiment is noteworthy. The global economy is taking longer to recover and that uncertainty is affecting Japanese companies,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
A sales tax hike that rolled out in October weighed on Japan's service sector, with the index for big non-manufacturers sliding to plus 20 from plus 21 in September. But the reading exceeded a Refinitiv estimate of plus 17.
""Domestic demand wasn't hurt much by the sales tax hike so far. Public works projects to be earmarked under the government's spending package will underpin growth,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
Big firms plan to increase capital expenditure by 6.8% in the current business year ending in March 2020, up slightly from their plan made three months ago, the survey showed. It compared with a median market forecast of a 6.0% gain.
The reading backs the BOJ's view that robust corporate spending plans will keep domestic demand firm and help the economy weather heightening overseas risks, analysts say.
""Domestic demand may slow temporarily ... though in the long-term, it will stay resilient,"" BOJ Deputy Governor Masayoshi Amamiya said on Thursday, adding that now was the time to stand pat and carefully watch upcoming data.
Capital expenditure has been among the few bright spots in Japan's economy as companies continue to invest in high-tech and labor-saving technology to cope with a labor crunch.
Japan's economy expanded at a much faster pace than initially reported in the third quarter, as solid domestic demand and business spending offset the pain from weak exports and output.
But many analysts anticipate a slowdown this quarter as the October sales tax hike weighs on consumption.

The tankan's sentiment indexes are derived by subtracting the number of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 11:06AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices tepid; jobless claims at more than two-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices were unexpectedly unchanged in November as increases in food and gasoline prices were offset by declining costs for services, pointing to muted inflation despite a recent uptick in consumer prices.
Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged to more than a two-year high last week. The jump in jobless claims, however, likely does not signal a pickup in layoffs as the data tends to be volatile in the period following the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
The reports were released a day after the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady. The U.S. central bank indicated on Wednesday that borrowing costs were likely to remain unchanged at least through next year amid expectations the economy would continue to grow modestly and the unemployment rate remain low.
""Inflationary pressures are not an issue,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""This supports the Fed's strong signal that if its expectations hold, monetary easing will not continue in 2020 and rate hikes are even more unlikely.""
The Labor Department said the flat reading in its producer price index for final demand last month followed a 0.4% rebound in October. The PPI gained 1.1% in the 12 months through November, matching October's rise, which was the smallest increase since October 2016. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would rise 0.2% in November and accelerate 1.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices were also unchanged last month after edging up 0.1% in October. The so-called core PPI increased 1.3% in the 12 months through November, the smallest gain since September 2016, after advancing 1.5% in October.
The dollar (DXY) ticked up against a basket of currencies, while prices of U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, buoyed by President Donald Trump's tweet that the United States was getting very close to a ""big deal"" with China.
The soft PPI data followed a report on Wednesday showing solid gains in consumer prices in November. The Fed, which has a 2% annual inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy.
The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in October and has fallen short of the target this year. November PCE price data will be published next week.
JOBLESS CLAIMS SURGE
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 49,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000 for the week ended Dec. 7, the highest reading since September 2017. The increase was the largest since August 2017. 
Claims dropped to 203,000 in the prior week, which was a seven-month low. The decline probably reflected a late Thanksgiving Day this year compared to 2018, which could have thrown off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.
""The recent volatility in the claims data is likely due to seasonal adjustment issues that we often see around the holiday season, and we saw a similar pattern across the weekly claims readings around Thanksgiving in 2013 when the holiday fell on November 28 like it did this year,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Economists had forecast claims would increase to 213,000 in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 6,250 to 224,000 last week.
The underlying trend in claims remains consistent with a strong labor market. The government reported last Friday that the economy added a robust 266,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, its lowest level in nearly half a century. Other data on housing, trade and manufacturing have also been relatively upbeat and suggested the economy was growing at a moderate speed rather than stalling. 
""We judge the momentum in the labor market to be solid,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
In November, wholesale energy prices increased 0.6% after rebounding 2.8% in October. They were supported by a 2.3% rise in gasoline prices, which followed a 7.3% surge in October.
Goods prices rose 0.3% last month, slowing from October's 0.7% gain in October. Wholesale food prices increased 1.1% after vaulting 1.3% in October. Core goods prices increased 0.2%. They were unchanged in October. 
There is still no sign that U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports are boosting inflation. Economists say importers and businesses were probably absorbing the duties to keep market share.
The cost of services fell 0.3% last month, the biggest drop since February 2017, reversing October's 0.3% gain. Trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, declined 0.6%, accounting for over two-thirds of the decrease in prices for services last month.
The cost of healthcare services fell 0.2% in November after accelerating 0.8% in the prior month. The cost of hospital outpatient care dropped 1.1% last month after vaulting 1.5% in October. Portfolio management fees rebounded 1.2% after falling 0.9% in October. 

Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index. As result, economists believe the core PCE price index nudged up 0.1% in November, with the year-on-year increase probably slowing to 1.5%.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2019 08:51AM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices unchanged; underlying inflation soft,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices were unexpectedly unchanged in November as increases in food and gasoline prices were offset by declining costs for services, pointing to muted inflation despite a recent uptick in consumer prices.
The Labor Department said on Thursday the flat reading in its producer price index for final demand last month followed a 0.4% surge in October. In the 12 months through November, the PPI gained 1.1%, matching October's rise, which was the smallest increase since October 2016.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would rise 0.2% in November and accelerate 1.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices were also unchanged last month after edging up 0.1% in October. The so-called core PPI increased 1.3% in the 12 months through November, the smallest gain since September 2016, after advancing 1.5% in October.
The data followed a report on Wednesday showing solid gains in consumer prices in November. The Federal Reserve, which has a 2% annual inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy.
The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in October and has fallen short of its target this year. November PCE price data will be published next week.
The Fed on Wednesday kept interest rates steady and indicated borrowing costs were likely to remain unchanged at least through next year amid expectations the economy would continue to grow modestly and the unemployment rate remain low. (Full Story)
The government reported last Friday that the economy added a robust 266,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, its lowest level in nearly half a century. Other data on housing, trade and manufacturing have also been relatively upbeat, and suggested the economy was growing at a moderate speed rather than stalling.
In November, wholesale energy prices increased 0.6% after rebounding 2.8% in October. They were supported by a 2.3% rise in gasoline prices, which followed a 7.3% surge in October.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 49,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000 for the week ended Dec. 7, the highest reading since September 2017, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The increase was the largest since August 2017.
Claims dropped to 203,000 in the prior week, which was a seven-month low. The decline likely reflected a late Thanksgiving Day this year compared to 2018, which could have thrown off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would increase to 213,000 in the latest week. The Labor Department said only claims for the Virgin Islands were estimated last week.
The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 6,250 to 224,000 last week. The underlying trend in claims remains consistent with a strong labor market.
The government reported last week that the economy added 266,000 jobs in November, the most in 10 months. The unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, the lowest in nearly half a century. Labor market strength is driving consumer spending, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite headwinds from trade tensions and slowing global growth.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates steady and indicated borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through 2020 amid expectations the economy would continue to grow modestly and the unemployment rate remain low.
Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 31,000 to 1.67 million for the week ended Nov. 30. The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims fell 6,250 to 1.68 million."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Services sector activity in Brazil expanded in October far more than economists had expected, figures on Thursday showed, indicating that overall growth in Latin America's largest economy continued to accelerate going into the year end.
The figures appear to back up the central bank's statement on Wednesday accompanying its decision to cut interest rates to a new low of 4.50% that ""economic activity since the second quarter indicates that the process of economic recovery picked up relative to the first quarter.""
Services sector activity rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8% in October from the previous month, according to government statistics agency IBGE, the second consecutive solid increase and far stronger than the no-change economists had expected.
Four of the five broad segments of activity tracked by IBGE showed an expansion in activity, with the biggest rise being the 1.8% increase in information and communication services.
On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, activity in October jumped 2.4% compared with the same month last year, IBGE said, also more than the 1.4% median increase economists in a Reuters poll had predicted.
The figures brought growth in the first 10 months of the year up to 0.8%, marking a steady increase from 0.6% in the January-September period and 0.5% in the January-August period, IBGE said.
Similarly, service sector growth in the 12 months to October rose to 0.8% from 0.7% in the 12 months to September and 0.5% in the year to August.
The data also runs counter to purchasing managers index figures that showed that growth in Brazil's services sector slowed in October to its weakest in four months."

With growth still well below potential in the 19-member currency bloc and inflation short of target, the ECB unleashed a fresh stimulus package in September. That means policy is effectively on auto pilot for months to come, giving Lagarde time and space to find her footing.
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels until it has seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2% within its projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics,"" the ECB said.
The ECB's press release did not deviate from the previous statement, suggesting Lagarde is comfortable with the stance devised by her predecessor, Mario Draghi, over the objections of many policymakers.
Attention now turns to Lagarde's first news conference at 1330 GMT, where she will unveil the ECB's new economic projections and may discuss the bank's strategic review, due to start early next year.
With Thursday's decision, the ECB's rate on bank overnight deposits, which is currently its primary interest rate tool, remains at a record low of -0.50%.
The main refinancing rate, which determines the cost of credit in the economy, remained unchanged at 0.00% while the rate on the marginal lending facility -- the emergency overnight borrowing rate for banks -- remains at 0.25%."

The ECB kept its deposit rate at a record-low minus 0.5%, and bond purchases at 20 billion euros ($22 billion) a month, sticking to a controversial package unveiled in September. Lagarde, who has said little on monetary policy since starting in November, will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m. in Frankfurt.
Follow Lagarde’s press conference in our live blog
The president could use her briefing to signal a start date for the first comprehensive evaluation of the ECB’s mission in 16 years. While that exercise will focus on whether the inflation goal needs to be adjusted, the Frenchwoman has made clear that she also wants to engage in broad topical issues such as fighting climate change.
That drive has already concerned some officials, who worry it’ll divert from their primary mandate of restoring price stability. Inflation has averaged just 1.2% so far in 2019, well short of the target of just below 2% -- despite years of unprecedented and often contentious stimulus under Lagarde’s predecessor, Mario Draghi.
As the first ECB head never to have worked at a central bank, Lagarde’s justification of the current measures are likely to be closely scrutinized by economists and investors. She’s spent her initial six weeks learning the ropes, addressing divisions between officials, and urging governments to help revive feeble growth.
She’ll also unveil the latest macroeconomic projections, including a first reading for 2022. While some indicators have suggested lately that the slowdown might be easing, Germany remains embroiled in its worst manufacturing slump in a decade. The U.S.-China trade war and Brexit have continued to weigh on growth.
Thursday’s policy announcement confirmed that asset purchases won’t end until “shortly” before the first rate hike, which would require inflation to be thoroughly within reach of its target.
Any indication that the outlook is set to remain bleak over the next years will raise questions over how much ammunition the central bank has left. Even officials most supportive of stimulus have signaled reluctance to cut the deposit rate deeper below the current level, and Lagarde herself has warned about detrimental side effects such as financial bubbles, squeezes on bank profitability and discontent among savers."

The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers gave the estimate on Thursday in Changsha, China. The drop compares with about a 3% decline in 2018, when sales fell for the first time since 1990.
The intensity of the 2019 slump has surprised the industry group, which a year ago predicted that annual sales would be little changed. The body is set to give a sales forecast for 2020 later on Thursday.
The China slump has left global automakers with few growth regions as sales also wane in Europe and the U.S. The industry is suffering as trade tensions and tariffs raise costs, just as competition from ride-hailing and car-sharing services reduce the need for individual car ownership.
Market leader Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG and rivals such as Honda Motor Co.,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG have continued to invest in the country of 1.4 billion people throughout the slowdown in the hopes that demand will pick up.

The overall unemployment rate edged up to 2.3% from 2.2% in the previous quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis, data from the manpower ministry showed. This was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009 when the unemployment rate touched 2.3%.
The rise was due to hiring caution amid underlying economic uncertainties, the ministry said in a statement, adding that an ""effort will be needed to help unemployed job seekers overcome skills mismatches with the remaining vacancies.""
Singapore's unemployment rate is significantly below other advanced economies with the OECD average around 5%.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's central bank cut its benchmark Selic interest rate to an all-time low of 4.50% on Wednesday, but indicated that with borrowing costs so low and economic growth starting to pick up, it may mark a pause in the easing cycle, if not the end.
The unanimous decision by the bank's nine-person rate-setting committee, known as Copom, was the fourth such move in a row, in line with the expectations of all 30 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll.
In its accompanying statement, Copom noted that growth had accelerated since the second quarter and flagged the need for a cautious approach to its next decisions, shifting gears after clear guidance of upcoming rate cuts in recent months.
""The current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy,"" policymakers said.
The policy outlook had already started to shift after Copom said in its last statement in October that one more rate cut was likely, but recommended ""caution"" regarding subsequent moves.
As a result, economists' unanimous expectation for lower rates over the next 12 months evaporated, and the latest Reuters poll showed there is no longer a majority saying the skew for rates is to the downside.
""I suspect there's a 70% chance Copom will now stay on hold, and a 30% chance it will cut,"" most likely by 25 basis points, said Jason Vieira, chief economist at Infinity Asset Management in Sao Paulo. ""What's important is that they highlighted the increase in activity and lagging effects of monetary policy.""
Jose Francisco Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo, went a step further. ""The right thing to do is to wait and see,"" he said. ""Do I think the cycle is over? Yes.""
Minutes after the central bank decision, ratings agency S&P raised its outlook on Brazil's sovereign credit to positive from neutral, a step toward a ratings upgrade that would lift Brazil back toward investment-grade status.
Official data last week showed that the economy appears to be in better shape than previously thought. Activity in the third quarter was stronger than expected, and last year's growth was revised up to 1.3% from 1.1%.
While inflation is still on track to undershoot the central bank's targets for this year and next ⁠— 4.25% and 4.00%, respectively ⁠— it is creeping higher again, boosted by the Brazilian currency's slide to a record low last month."
1678,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 05:03PM ET</span>",Brazil Cuts Rates and Leaves Options Open for Next Meeting,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to a record low and said it will exercise caution in its next monetary policy decision, leaving the door open for additional easing.
The bank’s board, led by its President Roberto Campos Neto, on Wednesday lowered the Selic rate to 4.5%, as expected by all 53 economists in a Bloomberg survey. It was the fourth straight reduction of 50 basis points, and it came hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve kept its key rate on hold.
The central bank “judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution'' on monetary policy, bank board members wrote in a statement issued after the decision. “The Committee emphasizes that its next steps will continue to depend on the evolution of economic activity, the balance of risks, and inflation projections and expectations.”
The central bank is ramping up monetary stimulus to jolt an economy that has only recently shown signs of gaining steam, after nearly three years of disappointing performance. They extended a record-breaking monetary easing cycle even after food costs jumped and the real hit a record low, potentially fueling inflation. Despite those shocks, analysts still see consumer prices running below target next year.
“The inflation outlook remains benign, even if prices picked up due to temporary factors, such as meat costs,” Luciano Rostagno, chief strategist at Banco Mizuho, said before the rate decision. “That wasn’t enough to change the central bank’s plans for a reduction.”
In the 12 months through November, consumer prices rose 3.27%, according to the national statistics agency. Policy makers target inflation at 4.25% this year and 4% in 2020.
Since the prior rate-setting meeting in late October, the real has weakened more than 3%, the second-worst drop in emerging markets. Campos Neto has said the Brazilian currency’s depreciation hasn’t translated into worse inflation expectations, and that the country’s risk premium has improved.

1679,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 03:31PM ET</span>",Fed Keeps Rates Steady as Tame Inflation Continues,"Investing.com - The Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold Wednesday, signaling that the current path of monetary policy was ""appropriate"" to support economic growth and would likely remain in place through next year. 
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
""Committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective,"" the FOMC said in its statement.
In July, the Fed cut interest rates for the first time since the Financial Crisis, more than a decade ago. Two further rate cuts followed the July cut.
 
Following the third rate cut at its October meeting, the Fed cooled expectations for further easing, insisting that monetary policy would remain on pause unless there was a material change to its outlook, particularly on inflation. 
Members of the rate-setting committee cut their 2020 median forecast for interest rates to 1.6% from a previous estimate of 1.9%, indicating rates will remain on hold next year. Four members of the rate-setting committee see rates moving higher next year.
The interest-rate outlook for both 2021 and 2022 was lowered to 1.9% and 2.1% from 2.1% and 2.4% respectively. 
The longer-run interest rate was unchanged from the September forecast at 2.5%.
The central bank maintained its outlook on U.S. economic growth, forecasting growth of 2.2% in 2019 and 2.0% in 2020. Growth for 2021 and 2021 was also left unchanged at 1.9% and 1.8% respectively, the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections showed.
The Federal Reserve operates under a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment and ensure the pace of inflation remains contained.
Its latest forecasts continued to point to a tight labor market, with the pace of inflation expected to improve next year, close to the Fed's 2% target. 
The Fed trimmed its 2019 forecast for the unemployment rate to 3.6% from 3.5% while inflation is expected to remain at 1.5% but rise close to the Fed's current 2% target next year. The Fed sees inflation reaching 2% in 2021 and 2022. 
 
The most recent reading of the core PCE index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, came in at 1.6%. The unemployment rate is at 3.5%, the lowest level in 50 years.
Fed chairman Jerome Powell singled out inflation as the key driver of future monetary policy. “In order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that’s persistent and that’s significant,"" Powell said.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2019 02:44PM ET</span>","Gasoline, rents lift U.S. consumer inflation in November","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in November, which together with labor market strength could support the Federal Reserve's intention to keep interest rates steady indefinitely after reducing borrowing costs three times this year.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed underlying inflation firming last month. 
The U.S. central bank held rates unchanged on Wednesday amid expectations the economy will continue to grow moderately next year and unemployment remain low. The Fed again signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it cut rates for the first time since 2008.
""There are no worrisome deflation undercurrents in this economy and Fed officials do not need to cut interest rates further to boost economic demand,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The consumer price index rose 0.3% last month as households paid more for gasoline and electricity, and food prices increased for a third consecutive month. The CPI advanced 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through November, the CPI shot up 2.1% after gaining 1.8% in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI climbing 0.2% in November and rising 2.0% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose by 0.2%, matching October's increase. The so-called core CPI was up by an unrounded 0.2298% last month compared to 0.1572% in October. The core CPI was lifted by gains in healthcare and prices of used cars and trucks, recreation and hotel and motel accommodation.
In the 12 months through November, the core CPI increased 2.3% after a similar gain in October. 
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2.0% inflation target, which is lagging other inflation measures. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in October and has undershot its target this year. 
November PCE price data will be published later this month.
The wide gap between the core PCE price index and core CPI exists because housing and healthcare have different weightings in each inflation measure. Even with the CPI perking up, the outlook for inflation remains benign.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Atlanta Fed said its sticky-price consumer price index (CPI), a weighted basket of items that change price relatively slowly, rose 2.6% on an annualized basis in November after increasing 3.3% in October. It was up 2.8% year-on-year in November.
The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading slightly higher. 
RISING RENTS
November's firmer inflation readings followed a report last Friday showing the economy added a robust 266,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, its lowest level in nearly half a century. Other data on housing, trade and manufacturing have also been relatively upbeat, and suggested the economy was growing at moderate speed rather than stalling.
""The economy appears well positioned to find its footing and extend the expansion into 2020,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
In November, gasoline prices rose 1.1% after rebounding 3.7% in October. Prices for food as well as food consumed at home edged up 0.1%. Core goods prices were unchanged last month, despite U.S. tariffs on merchandise imported from China. 
The cost of core services rose 0.3% after increasing 0.2% in October. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.2% last month, matching October's rise. 
The rent index gained 0.3% after edging up 0.1% in October, which was the smallest gain since April 2011. It was lifted by a 1.1% rebound in the cost of hotel and motel accommodation after tumbling 3.8% in October.
Healthcare costs rose 0.3% in November after surging 1.0% in October, which was the most since August 2016. The cost of hospital services rose 0.3% last month and prices for doctor visits gained 0.1%. But prices for prescription medication slipped 0.1% after surging 1.8% in October.
Apparel prices nudged up 0.1% last month after declining 1.8% in October. Used motor vehicle and truck prices increased 0.6% after rising 1.3% in October. The cost of recreation goods and services increased 0.4%, boosted by rises in the prices of cable and satellite television services and sporting goods.

But new vehicle prices fell for a fifth straight month, likely because of deep discounting by automakers trying to get rid of stocks of older models. There were also decreases in the prices of airline tickets and motor vehicle insurance. The cost of household furnishing and operations was unchanged.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentine markets held steady on Wednesday, waiting for policy signals from the newly inaugurated government of center-left leader Alberto Fernandez and his top economic team after conservative Mauricio Macri handed over power this week.
The peso , whose freefall has been kept in check by currency controls imposed in September, ended flat, while over-the-counter bonds rose slightly. The country's S&P Merval stock index (MERV) was also unmoved.
Argentina's new economy minister, 37-year-old Martin Guzman, is expected to start laying out his plans to stabilize the country's wobbly economy and revitalize growth after the latter stage of Macri's rule was plagued by recession.
""The uncertainty which we have lived with in recent months should begin to clear,"" local brokerage Portfolio Personal Investment (PPI) said in a note.
Axel Kicillof, a leftist economist who took over as the governor of Buenos Aires province, Argentina's largest, said in a speech the local government did not have enough funds to cover all its debt obligations while paying its bills.
Buenos Aires has been a major issuer of debt, including to overseas creditors, who see the province as a test case for how Argentina will be able to deal overall with talks to restructure around $100 billion of debt amid fears over a default.
""The province wants and has the will to fulfill its commitments, but it needs to have a sustainable debt structure. The financial situation of the province is delicate,"" Kicillof said in a speech in the city La Plata.
""We will start a dialogue with creditors to find a solution to the problem between the government, the people and them.""
Peronist leader Fernandez was sworn in as president on Tuesday, marking a shift to the left for Argentina, Latin America's No. 3 economy, as the country fights rampant inflation, credit default fears and rising poverty.
Argentine bonds have risen this week, a signal of investor hopes that the new administration will take a positive approach to talks about restructuring its debt.
The new government will likely look to cut high interest rates, currently above 60%, which are set by daily central bank auctions of short-term ""Leliq"" notes, which had gone out of fashion with banks ahead of the new government's arrival.
A second daily Leliq auction on Wednesday failed, traders told Reuters, the first time since October last year.

Most senior finance executives at U.S. businesses believe the U.S. will be in an economic recession by the end of 2020, and 76% predict a recession by mid-2021, according to fourth-quarter results from the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook.
But, even with a recession on the horizon, the U.S. firm CFOs lead the world in terms of optimism about the general business environment.
At the company level, firms are taking steps to mitigate the effects of a recession by increasing their cash holdings.
“Hoarding cash and reducing debt are the most obvious tactics to dull the blow of a recession,” said Campbell Harvey, professor at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business.
Globally, U.S. based firms have the highest degree of optimism about their own company. Capital spending is expected to rise 4.7% and wages are anticipated to grow 4.4%, the largest increases since the first-quarter survey.
Economic uncertainty remains a major concern among CFOs around the world.
The Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook survey has been conducted for 95 consecutive quarters. The survey period ended Dec. 6 and generated responses from more than 800 CFOs, including nearly 500 in North America, 87 from Asia, 87 from Europe, 139 from Latin America and 40 from Africa."

The Labor Department said on Wednesday its consumer price index increased 0.3% last month as households paid more for gasoline. The CPI advanced 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through November, the CPI rose 2.1% after gaining 1.8% in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI climbing 0.2% in November and rising 2.0% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI rose by 0.2%, matching October's increase. The so-called core CPI was up by an unrounded 0.2298% last month compared to 0.1572% in October. It was lifted by gains in healthcare and prices of used cars and trucks, recreation and hotel and motel accommodation.
In the 12 months through November, the core CPI increased 2.3% after a similar gain in October.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2.0% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in October and has undershot its target this year. November PCE price data will be published later this month.
Fed officials were due to conclude a two-day policy meeting later on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank is expected to keep rates on hold after reducing borrowing costs in October for the third time this year. It has signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it cut rates for the first time since 2008.
November's firmer inflation readings followed a report last Friday showing the economy added a robust 266,000 jobs in November and the unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, its lowest level in nearly half a century. Other data on housing, trade and manufacturing have also been relatively upbeat, and suggested the economy was growing at moderate speed rather than stalling.
In November, gasoline prices rose 1.1% after rebounding 3.7% in October. Food prices edged up 0.1%, rising for a third straight month. Food consumed at home gained 0.1%.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, increased 0.2% last month, matching October's rise. The rent index gained 0.3% after edging up 0.1% in October, which was the smallest gain since April 2011.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian retail sales rose in October for the sixth month in a row, official figures on Wednesday showed, although the pace of growth slowed to just 0.1%, suggesting the consumer started the fourth quarter on a cautious footing.
That was below the 0.3% median increase forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and the lowest month-on-month rise since May, figures from government statistics agency IBGE showed.
The 4.2% annual rate of retail sales growth was higher than the 3.8% forecast in a Reuters poll and the second highest rate this year after July's 4.3% rise.
Recent data shows that the Brazilian economy is starting to pick up, as historically low interest rates and inflation fuel an upswing in domestic demand that government officials hope will accelerate further into next year.
Wednesday's retail sales figures showed that six out of the eight sectors covered by IBGE registered growth from the month before.
Sales of office, computer and communication equipment rose 5.3%, fuel and oil rose 1.7%, pharmaceutical, medical and cosmetic goods rose 1.2%, and furniture and household appliances rose 0.9%, IBGE said.
The biggest drag on overall sales was a 0.1% decline in sales across hypermarkets, supermarkets, food & drink and tobacco.
Accumulated retail sales in the first 10 months of the year rose 1.6%, and in the 12 months to October they were up 1.8%, IBGE said."
1685,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 12:39PM ET</span>",U.S. third-quarter labor cost growth cut; productivity soft,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Growth of U.S. labor costs was not as robust as initially thought in the third quarter, suggesting inflation could remain tame in the near term.
The sharp downward revision to labor costs, reported by the Labor Department on Tuesday, also pointed to some easing of the squeeze on profit margins. Corporate profits have been reduced by strong labor cost growth that has outpaced revenue. With worker productivity still sluggish, however, the pace of growth in labor costs is likely to remain solid.
""This is certainly good news for companies' profit margins which have been under pressure,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, slower productivity growth and steady compensation growth will keep upward pressure on unit labor costs going forward.""
Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 2.5% annualized rate in the third quarter. They were previously reported to have advanced at a 3.6% rate. Compared with the third quarter of 2018, labor costs grew at a 2.2% rate, rather than the previously estimated 3.1%. Growth in hourly compensation was also revised lower, to a 2.3% rate in the third quarter, from the originally reported 3.3% pace. Hourly compensation grew at a 3.7% rate compared with the third quarter of 2018, instead of the previously reported 4.5% pace. 
Last quarter's gains in unit labor costs and compensation are in line with other measures showing moderate wage gains. A survey of small businesses on Tuesday showed the share of owners raising wages was unchanged in November. While the proportion of those planning to increase compensation rose to near a 30-year high, there was no strong appetite to increase prices. 
These developments indicate inflation will probably continue to run below the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
""That is about the same as the pace of inflation and indicates stable inflation,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.
The central bank is not expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday against the backdrop of relatively upbeat economic data, including a sharp narrowing in the trade deficit in October, a rebound in orders for big-ticket items and a surge in job growth in November.
The Fed cut rates in October for the third time this year, but signaled a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
The central bank's preferred inflation measure increased 1.6% in the 12 months through October, slowing from 1.7% in September. November data will be published later this month.
The government reported last month that after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6% in the third quarter. Profits were down at a rate of 0.4% compared with the third quarter of 2018.
The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell, while stocks on Wall Street were mixed.
PRODUCTIVITY MISMEASURED?
The government also confirmed that worker productivity fell by the most in nearly four years in the third quarter as a rebound in hours, driven by a surge in the volatile self-employed and unpaid family workers component, outpaced output.
Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, decreased at a 0.2% rate in the last quarter, the biggest drop since the fourth quarter of 2015. Productivity was previously reported to have declined at a 0.3% pace in the July-September quarter. 
Productivity grew at an unrevised 2.5% rate in the second quarter. Hours worked increased at a 2.5% rate last quarter.
The government last month revised up third-quarter gross domestic product growth to a 2.1% rate from a 1.9% pace.
Compared with the third quarter of 2018, productivity increased at a 1.5% rate, instead of the previously reported 1.4% pace. Tepid productivity suggests the economy is unlikely to achieve the Trump administration's goal of 3% annual growth.
Productivity grew at an average annual rate of 1.3% from 2007 to 2018, below its long-term rate of 2.1% from 1947 to 2018, indicating that the speed at which the economy can expand over a long period without igniting inflation has slowed.
Sluggish productivity has been blamed on a range of factors, including a shortage of workers, low capital expenditure and inaccurate measurement on the information technology side. 

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in October the U.S. central bank was ""carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured productivity gains.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity fell by the most in nearly four years in the third quarter, the government confirmed, while growth in unit labor costs was not as robust as initially thought.

Productivity was previously reported to have decreased at a 0.3% pace in the July-September quarter. A rebound in hours, driven by a surge in the volatile self-employed and unpaid family workers component, outpaced output in the third quarter.
Productivity grew at an unrevised 2.5% rate in the second quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected third-quarter productivity would be revised up to show it falling at a 0.1% rate.
The government last month revised up third-quarter gross domestic product growth to a 2.1% rate from a 1.9% pace.
Compared to the third quarter of 2018, productivity increased at a 1.5% rate, instead of the previously reported 1.4% pace. Tepid productivity suggests the economy is unlikely to achieve the Trump administration's goal of 3% annual growth.

Some economists blame soft productivity on a shortage of workers as well as the impact of rampant drug addiction in some parts of the country. Others also argue that low capital expenditure, which they say has resulted in a sharp drop in the capital-to-labor ratio, is holding down productivity.
There is also a belief that productivity is being inaccurately measured, especially on the information technology side. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in October the U.S. central bank was ""carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured productivity gains.""
Fed officials were scheduled to begin a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. The central bank is not expected to cut interest rates on Wednesday after reducing borrowing costs in October for the third time this year.
Hours worked rose at a revised 2.5% rate last quarter. That was up from the 2.4% pace estimated in November.
Soft productivity last quarter lifted labor costs, though the pace of increase was not as robust as previously estimated. Unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, increased at a 2.5% rate in the third quarter. They were previously reported to have advanced at a 3.6% rate.
Compared to the third quarter of 2018, labor costs grew at a 2.2% rate, rather than the previously estimated 3.1%.
Hourly compensation increased at a 2.3% rate in the third quarter, instead of the originally reported 3.3% pace. Hourly compensation rose at a 3.7% rate compared to the third quarter of 2018.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2019 06:17AM ET</span>","UK economy flat-lines, hit by Brexit and global slowdown, as election nears","By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew at its slowest annual pace in nearly seven years in October, a weak backdrop to Thursday's national election, in which both leading parties are promising to boost growth.
The approach of a Brexit deadline and the global economic slowdown hit Britain's factories and construction industry during the month, official data showed on Tuesday.
Gross domestic product rose by 0.7% compared with October 2018, the weakest growth since March 2012, when Britain was still trying to shake off the effects of the global financial crisis.
In the three months to October, growth flat-lined compared with the previous three-month period, the Office for National Statistics said, as expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
The economy also showed no change in monthly terms, the ONS said, weaker than a median forecast of 0.1% growth in the poll.
Financial markets, fixated on the Dec. 12 national election, showed little reaction to the data.
""The stagnation in GDP in October is unlikely to influence many people's vote in Thursday's election, but it could prompt some more (Bank of England officials) to consider voting for lower interest rates in the coming months,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
Britain's economy avoided falling into a pre-Brexit recession over the summer. But it has slowed as an Oct. 31 deadline for leaving the European Union - now extended to Jan. 31 - approached, and uncertainty about the election outcome has probably made business more cautious.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged voters to back him because his Brexit deal would ""unleash a great tide of investment"" when it clears a currently deadlocked parliament.
But worries about a chaotic exit from the EU are unlikely to vanish even if Johnson wins because he has ruled out asking Brussels to extend a transition period if a deal for future trade ties has not been agreed by the end of 2020.
The opposition Labour Party has said it will hold a fresh Brexit referendum after negotiating a new Brexit deal, potentially offsetting some of the concerns among many businesses about other Labour policies, including higher corporate taxes and nationalization of some key industries.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy was growing more slowly than the BoE expected, but the promises of looser fiscal policy by the main political parties would reduce the need for lower interest rates.
The ONS also said industrial output fell by 0.7% in the three months to October while Britain's services grew by 0.2%, the weakest increase since June. Construction output suffered the biggest monthly fall since January 2018. 
Separately, the ONS said Britain's goods trade deficit widened by more than expected to nearly 14.5 billion pounds ($18.60 billion) in October from 11.5 billion pounds in September.
The ONS said the approach of the lapsed October Brexit deadline appeared to have increased imports and exports in October, but by less than before the original Brexit deadline at the end of March.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors improved far more than forecast in December, a survey showed on Tuesday, with an unexpected rise in October exports boosting hopes for an upturn in Europe's biggest economy.
The ZEW research institute's monthly index on economic morale among investors rose to 10.7 from -2.1 a month earlier. The reading exceeded even the highest forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, which showed a consensus prediction of 0.0.
Europe's biggest economy has been going through a soft patch as its export-oriented manufacturers struggle against a backdrop of trade friction, an ailing car industry and uncertainties over Britain's planned departure from the European Union.
But data on Monday showed German exports rose unexpectedly in October as demand from beyond Europe increased, helping to buoy investor sentiment.
ZEW President Achim Wambach said the rise in morale ""rests on the hope that German exports and private consumption will develop better than previously thought"".
He added: ""This hope results from a higher-than-expected German foreign trade surplus in October, alongside relatively robust economic growth in the EU in the third quarter and a stable German labor market.""
In its 10th successive year of growth, Germany's economy has been relying on strong consumption as exports weaken, which resulted in a second-quarter economic contraction of 0.2%.
The economy grew by just 0.1% in the third quarter, narrowly avoiding recession, which economists usually define as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.
A separate ZEW gauge measuring investors' assessment of the economy's current conditions rose to -19.9 from -24.7 in the previous month. Analysts had forecast a reading of -22.3.
""The message is: The economy has bottomed out, without it pointing to a dynamic recovery,"" said Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Auto sales in China fell for a 17th consecutive month in November, with the number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) sold contracting for a fifth month in a row, data from its biggest auto industry association showed on Tuesday.
Total auto sales in the world's biggest auto market fell 3.6% from the same month a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said.
That follows a drop of 4% in October and 5.2% in September. Car sales in the country contracted last year for the first time since the 1990s against a backdrop of slowing economic growth and a crippling Sino-U.S. trade war.
""The China 5-6 emission standard change is the biggest reason for this year’s sales plunge,"" said Chen Shihua, deputy secretary general at CAAM, referring to how local governments had accelerated changes to emission standards this year.
He added that overall car production levels were now returning to normal and carmakers had boosted their product line-ups in the past few months.
In November, sales of NEVs fell 43.7%, CAAM said, following a 45.6% drop in October. NEV sales had jumped almost 62% last year even as the broader auto market contracted.
NEVs include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.
China has been a keen supporter of NEVs and has implemented sales quota requirements for automakers. But it cut subsidies this year and plans to phase them out after 2020 amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on the funds, making NEVs costlier and dampening demand.
""Next year there will be different NEV manufacturing quotas for carmakers. I think next year will also be an adjustment period and sales of new energy vehicle will be better than this year,"" said Xu Haidong, assistant secretary general at CAAM.
The prolonged car sales crisis has made global car makers from Ford (N:F) to PSA [PEUPFI.UL] cut China production plans.
Geely (HK:0175), China's best known car maker globally, said sales rose 1% year-on-year in November while China's biggest carmaker SAIC Motor (SS:600104) saw a 9.6% drop due to poor performance from joint ventures with General Motors (N:GM).
NEV sales at both BYD (SZ:002594) and BAIC's electric vehicle unit BluePark <600733.SS>, in which  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) has a stake, fell around 63% last month from a year ago.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's consumer inflation climbed to nearly eight-year peaks in November as pork prices doubled, but factory-gate prices remained in the red, adding to uncertainty over whether the manufacturing sector is bottoming out as trade risks persist.
Beijing is under pressure to unleash more stimulus to boost industrial activity, but high inflation ahead of the Lunar New Year may be a headache for policymakers trying to shore up growth that has slipped to the lowest in nearly 30 years.
Consumer prices in November rose 4.5% on year, the fastest pace seen since January 2012, driven mostly by a surge in pork prices as African Swine Fever ravaged the country's hog herds, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Tuesday. That topped analysts' expectations of 4.2% and October's 3.8% rise.
However, core inflation - which excludes food and energy prices - stayed largely subdued.
""The high CPI would surely have an impact on China's monetary policy, but overall we don't see risks of inflation spike across the board, so current monetary policy with a loosening bias will not be significantly affected,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst with Bank of Communications.
In contrast, the producer price index (PPI), seen as a key indicator of corporate profitability, fell 1.4% on year, falling for the fifth month in a row. That compared with a 1.5% drop forecast in a Reuters poll and 1.6% fall in October.
Price declines for manufactured goods suggest demand remains weak, despite hints of improvement in recent factory surveys.
""There are few signs of a pick-up in demand-side price pressures,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. ""Higher prices of consumer goods in the PPI basket, one component of which is food, were more than offset by more pronounced declines in the prices of industrial goods.""
Weak prices were mainly seen in oil and gas extraction and chemical fiber manufacturing sectors.
Beijing and Washington are negotiating a first phase trade deal aimed at de-escalating their trade dispute but they continue to wrangle over key details. But even if a deal is struck, economic growth is expected to continue slowing in the current and coming quarters, however. Government advisers said China should lower its growth target to around 6% in 2020 as the trade dispute remains unresolved.
China has rolled out a series of measures to support growth, including reductions in market interest rates, but the government has insisted it will not resort to ""flood-like"" stimulus, however.
CPI REMAINS ELEVATED
Consumer inflation was driven largely by a continued surge in pork prices and other meats after the African Swine Fever killed a large portion of China's pigs.
Wholesale pork prices have seen a slight reprieve in November but remain elevated from a year earlier. The statistics bureau said pork prices more than doubled year-on-year in November.
Analysts expect pork will remain in high demand as China prepares to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the peak consumption period for the meat. Retail pork prices hovered at around 55 yuan ($7.81) per kg in November, according to agriculture ministry data.
Climbing consumer prices are adding to the headaches of policymakers who are racing to meet Beijing's annual growth target as the world's second-largest economy slows to the lower end of a 6%-6.5% range for 2019.
However, core CPI for November remained benign at 1.4%, down from 1.5% in the previous month. For the full year of 2019, China is aiming for a CPI target of around 3%. It rose 2.8% in the January-November period.
Many China watchers also predict that pork price inflation may be close to a peak as recent policies to stabilize production and support the recovery of the pig herd have begun to show results.
""The month-on-month CPI saw a big drop in November and food price inflation might be 'a spent bullet'. Overall consumer inflation will likely trend down from Q2 next year,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank in Beijing.
Despite inflation risks, China's central bank has slowly picked up its tempo of policy easing since late last month by cutting key Chinese rates, suggesting Beijing is keen to push ahead with lowering financing costs across the curve.
China's central bank governor Yi Gang said this month that Beijing would maintain ""normal"" monetary policy as long as possible since economic growth is still within a reasonable range and inflation is mild overall."

Growth was mainly driven by increased sales of food and auto parts, although sales of communication equipment remained weak.

The national consumer price index rose 2.97% in the year through November, according to the national statistics institute, INEGI. The rate fell below the estimates of analysts in a Reuters poll and the 3.02% recorded in October.
Lower pressure on the prices of some agricultural products contributed to the decline in inflation.
The core index, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.22% percent during the month.
Consumer prices rose 0.81 percent in November, according to non-seasonally adjusted figures.

The 1.2% rise in exports raises hopes that the economy can avoid contracting in the final quarter, despite producing a string of negative economic indicators in recent weeks, including a fall in industrial output last week.
The surprise increase was mainly driven by strong demand from non-European countries: sales to European Union countries were up 0.1% compared with a year ago but the value of German goods sold to non-European countries rose by 4.6%.
Analysts had expected exports to fall 0.7% in October.
""After last week's disappointing industrial data, this morning's trade data brought some welcome relief for the economy,"" said ING's Carsten Brzeski, who warned against excessive optimism.
""Looking ahead, however, the ongoing drought in order books is a strong argument against any optimism,"" he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment improved slightly in November, recovering from a multi-year low hit in the previous month when a sales tax hike and a huge typhoon hit business morale. 
The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions rose 2.7 points to 39.4 from 36.7 in October.
In October, Japan raised a twice-delayed sales tax to 10% from 8% while a powerful typhoon dented consumer sentiment and business activity, sending the sentiment index in the month to its lowest since May 2011.
The outlook index, which indicates the level of confidence in future conditions, rose 2.0 points to 45.7 in November from 43.7 in October.
A survey reading above 50 indicates optimism while a reading below 50 indicates pessimism.
The index showed ""the pace of recovery has been slow recently and there were still some reactionary falls from rush demand ahead of the tax hike,"" the government said. 
The Cabinet Office started compiling the data in comparative form in August 2001.
""The pace of declines in sales has slowed compared with three months ago. The impact from the sales tax hike is waning comparatively,"" said a respondent from a restaurant.
Another respondent from a department store said ""About two months passed since the sales tax hike, but its impact still appears in sales of jewelry, cosmetic goods and clothing.""
Slowing global demand has also affected business sentiment.
""Demand from overseas remains low, it is hard to expect sales to increase,"" said a general machinery firm.
""It's likely the tax hike has made consumers more frugal,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The economy in the fourth quarter could shrink more than previously expected as consumer spending and factory output is weak,"" he said.
Japan's cabinet last week approved a $122 billion fiscal package to support the economy amid offshore risks and as policymakers look to sustain activity beyond the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2019 01:34AM ET</span>","China November exports fall, but import growth hints of recovering demand","By Gabriel Crossley and Se Young Lee
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports in November shrank for the fourth consecutive month, underscoring persistent pressures on manufacturers from the Sino-U.S. war but growth in imports may be a sign that Beijing's stimulus steps are helping to stoke demand.
The 17-month long trade dispute has heightened the risks of a global recession and fueled speculation that China's policymakers could unleash more stimulus as growth in the world's second-largest economy cooled to nearly 30-year lows.
Overseas shipments fell 1.1% from a year earlier last month, customs data showed on Sunday, compared with a 1.0% expansion tipped by a Reuters poll of analysts and a 0.9% drop in October. 
Imports unexpectedly rose 0.3% from a year earlier, marking the first year-on-year growth since April and compared with a 1.8% decline forecast by economists.
The better-than-expected import data may point to firming domestic demand after factory activity showed surprising signs of improvement recently, although analysts have noted the recovery could be difficult to sustain amid trade risks.
China's trade surplus for November stood at $38.73 billion, compared with an expected $46.30 billion surplus in the poll and a $42.81 billion surplus recorded in October.
TRADE TENSIONS
Beijing and Washington are negotiating a first phase trade deal aimed at de-escalating a trade dispute but they continue to wrangle over key details.
A U.S. House bill targeting China's camps for ethnic Muslim minorities in Xinjiang and other bills supporting anti-government protesters in Hong Kong have also angered Beijing, further clouding prospects for a deal.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday trade talks with China are ""moving right along,"" striking an upbeat tone even as Chinese officials held fast to their line that existing tariffs must come off as part of an interim deal. Earlier in the week, though, Trump rattled global markets when he said a deal might have to wait until after the 2020 election. 
Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday that a Dec. 15 deadline is still in place to impose a new round of U.S. tariffs on some $156 billion of China's remaining exports to the United States, but the president likes where trade talks with China are going, he added.
One Chinese official told Reuters that China will implement its own tariffs as a countermeasure if the Dec. 15 tariffs go into place, which may dash any chance of a near-term trade deal.
Trump has demanded that China commit to specific minimum purchases of U.S. agricultural products, among other concessions on intellectual property rights, currency and access to China's financial services markets.
China's trade surplus with the United States for November stood at $24.60 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data, easing from the previous month's surplus of $26.45 billion.
China confirmed on Friday that it will waive import tariffs for some soybeans and pork shipments from the United States.
DOMESTIC DEMAND
Imports of copper rose 12.1% on the previous month as an improvement in the manufacturing sector stoked higher demand for the red metal, customs data showed on Sunday.
China's official factory activity gauge returned to growth for the first time in seven months in November, with a private survey showing activity expanding at the quickest pace in almost three years. 
But falling industrial profits and factory prices suggest persisting downward pressure on the sector.
Iron ore imports fell for a second straight month in November, pulled down by falling shipments from top miners in Australia and Brazil despite firm demand at mills. 
Despite the growing strains on the economy, Beijing remains reluctant to implement major stimulus for fear of heightening financial risks given already high levels of debt. 
Authorities have instead opted for more targeted measures such as incremental interest rate reductions and bringing forward 1 trillion yuan ($142.1 billion) of the 2020 local government special bonds quota to this year.

People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang reiterated in a signed article published last week that China will not resort to quantitative easing and is committed to maintaining a prudent monetary policy.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 11:11PM ET</span>","China's November forex reserves ease to $3.096 trillion, focus stays on trade talks","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign exchange reserves fell $9 billion in November to $3.096 trillion, central bank data showed on Saturday, as Washington and Beijing remained locked in negotiations over an interim trade agreement.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected China's reserves, the world's largest, would fall $4 billion to $3.101 trillion in November.
Despite the slowing Chinese economy and escalating U.S.-China trade war, its reserves have been gradually rising since late 2018, helped by tight capital controls and rising inflows from foreign investors who are snapping up the country's stocks and bonds.
Modest changes in reserve levels in recent months have been largely ascribed to fluctuations in global exchange rates and the value of assets that China holds such as foreign bonds.
The yuan has been driven largely by twists and turns in the 17-month long trade war between China and the United States.
After sliding sharply this summer as the dispute suddenly escalated, the yuan rose for three straight months through November on hopes of a trade truce, only to slide again in early December as tensions between Washington and Beijing flared. Fresh U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are set to take effect on Dec. 15.
It gained 0.12% against the dollar in November, but remains about 2.3% weaker for the year to date.
The dollar, meanwhile, rose about 1 percent against a basket of other major currencies in November.
The value of the country's gold reserves fell to $91.47 billion at the end of November from $94.65 billion at the end of October.
China held 62.64 million fine troy ounces of gold at the end of November, unchanged from October.
China's economic growth cooled to 6.0% in the third quarter, the slowest pace in nearly 30 years, and many economists believe it will decelerate further into the upper 5% range in 2020.
Still, analysts note capital outflows have been modest compared with the last economic downturn in 2015-16, when policymakers burned through roughly $1 trillion in reserves supporting the yuan.
China's central bank has started to slowly trim interest rates in recent months, and more reductions are expected in coming quarters to avert a sharper slowdown.
But analysts believe those cuts will likely be more gradual and smaller than those in 2015. If so, moves in the yuan are likely to be influenced more by trade developments than policy easing."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth increased by the most in 10 months in November as the healthcare industry boosted hiring and production workers at General Motors (N:GM) returned to work after a strike, the strongest sign yet the economy is in no danger of stalling.
The unemployment rate ticked back down to its lowest level in nearly half a century and wage gains remained near their strongest in a decade, the Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report showed on Friday. 
The numbers suggest consumers will keep the longest economic expansion in history, now in its 11th year, chugging along into next year when Americans will decide whether to re-elect President Donald Trump. 
The report added to other fairly upbeat data on the trade deficit, housing and orders for big-ticket goods. Together, the improving data appear to validate the Federal Reserve's decision in October to signal no further interest rate cuts are needed for now. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times this year, starting in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.
U.S. central bank policymakers are expected to highlight the economy's resilience when they meet on Dec. 10-11, though trade tensions continue to reverberate in the background.
""This was a strong report, with a solid rise in payrolls, another drop in the unemployment rate, and decent growth in hourly earnings,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The Fed will see this as clear vindication of their decision to stop cutting rates.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 jobs last month, lifted by the gain of 60,200 healthcare workers, the most since March, and increased hiring at restaurants and bars, the government's survey of establishments showed. Manufacturing recouped all the 43,000 positions lost in October. 
But colder-than-normal temperatures in November curbed hiring at construction sites and helped to sink mining payrolls.
The largest increase in payrolls since January pushed job growth well above its monthly average of 180,000 this year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 180,000 jobs in November. The economy created 41,000 more jobs in September and October than previously estimated. 
Even discounting the roughly 46,000 GM returnees, employment growth exceeded 200,000 jobs last month. The robust payroll gains suggest the Trump administration's 17-month trade war with China, which has plunged manufacturing into recession, has not yet spilled over to the broader economy.
Some economists said this could buy the Trump administration more time as it negotiates a ""phase one"" trade deal with China. Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday the Dec. 15 deadline remained in place for a new round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods set to kick in, adding ""there's no arbitrary deadline,"" on trade talks.
""The report alleviates pressure on the Trump administration to make a trade deal with China, giving negotiators more leverage to push for a harder line,"" said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor in San Francisco. 
The dollar (DXY) strengthened against a basket of currencies, snapping a five-day losing streak. U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street rallied after a roller-coaster week.
STEADY WAGE GAINS
The U.S.-China trade spat has bruised business confidence and undercut capital expenditure, tipping manufacturing into recession. The magnitude of last month's increase in payrolls is at odds with other labor market data. 
Job openings are near a 1-1/2-year low, small business hiring intentions have softened relative to 2018 and the Institute for Supply Management survey's measure of factory employment has contracted for four straight months. 
""While this morning's reading is a definite improvement, it does little to explain waning momentum over the past ten months,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. ""It remains to be seen if such strength signals a turning point to more robust hiring patterns.""
Though the labor market remains resilient despite the business investment downturn, hiring has slowed from last year's average monthly gain of 223,000 because of ebbing demand and a shortage of workers. The government has said it could cut job growth for the 12 months through March 2019 by at least 500,000 jobs when it publishes its annual revision next February.
Still, job creation is well over the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.5% percent, matching September's reading, which was the lowest level since December 1969. 
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 6.9% from 7.0% in October. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, dipped to 63.2% in November from more than a six-year high of 63.3% in October.
Average hourly earnings rose seven cents, or 0.2%, after increasing 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through November, wages rose 3.1% after advancing 3.2% in October. Wages were held back by the concentration of hiring in low-paying industries.
Average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers, considered a more reliable wage measure, increased 0.3% and were up 3.7% on a year-on-year basis in November. 
""That should keep consumer spending in good shape in the coming months,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Manufacturing employment rebounded by 54,000 jobs in November. Construction hiring rose by only 1,000 jobs, while mining shed 7,000 jobs.
The leisure and hospitality industry hired 45,000 workers. It has added 219,000 jobs over the last four months, with about two-thirds of the gains at restaurants and bars. 

There were also increases in professional and business services, financial activities, and transportation and warehousing jobs last month. Government employment increased by 12,000 jobs.

1698,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 06, 2019 03:31PM ET</span>",Consumer Credit in U.S. Rises More Than Forecast in October,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer debt rose more than forecast in October as Americans carried more credit card debt, suggesting consumer spending remains steady amid the strong job market.
Total credit increased $18.9 billion from the prior month, beating the median estimate of economists, following an upwardly revised $9.6 billion gain in September, Federal Reserve data showed Friday. Revolving debt outstanding and non-revolving credit both climbed.
Key Insights

The rebound in total credit signals American consumers are on steady footing at the start of the fourth quarter amid a tight labor market, consistent wage gains and improving confidence.
Labor Department data released earlier Friday showed a strong jobs market is likely to support spending. The nation added 266,000 to nonfarm payrolls in November, topping all forecasts, as wage gains held up and unemployment matched a half-century low.
Revolving credit outstanding, which includes credit card debt, increased $7.9 billion after a $187 million rise the prior month and a decline in August.
Non-revolving debt outstanding climbed $11 billion after a $9.4 billion rise. Such debt includes loans for school and cars.

Credit expanded at an annual rate of 5.5% in October after growing 2.8% the month prior.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had projected the credit gauge would rise by $16 billion.
Lending by the federal government, which is mainly for student loans, climbed $3.5 billion before seasonal adjustment.

The University of Michigan's preliminary sentiment index for December increased to 99.2 from 96.8 in November, exceeding all but one forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The gauge of current conditions climbed to a one-year high of 115.2 while the expectations index rose to 88.9, the highest since July, data showed Friday.
Key Insights

The report said the sentiment increase was concentrated among upper-income households, who stand most to benefit from stock prices that reached a record in late November. At the same time, sentiment has gained for four straight months since the measure fell to the lowest in almost three years in August on concerns about how tariffs would impact the economy.
Partisan differences also sharpened, as Republicans' sentiment jumped to the highest since President Donald Trump took office, while Democrats recorded a decline and independents were little changed. Virtually no respondents spontaneously mentioned impeachment, according to the report.
The index of buying conditions for household durables rose to the highest in a year, driven by renewed price discounts, boding well for retailers' holiday sales. Future job and income prospects also spurred increases in vehicle buying plans, according to the report.
The report comes on the heels of jobs data Friday showing U.S. payrolls trounced forecasts in November with a 266,000 gain as unemployment matched a half-century low. A strong labor market and steady wage gains should continue to support sentiment measures and consumer spending in coming months.

Official's View
“Nearly all of the early December gain was among upper-income households, who also reported near-record gains in household wealth, largely due to increased stock prices and mainly benefiting retirement accounts,” Richard Curtin, director of the University of Michigan consumer survey, said in a statement.

Longer-term inflation expectations fell to 2.3%, matching a record low in the survey. Federal Reserve policy makers watch this figure closely and have cited below-target inflation as one of the reasons behind the three interest- rate cuts this year. The Fed, which holds a meeting next week, has signaled it will keep rates on hold barring a material shift in the outlook.
Inflation expectations for the year ahead fell to 2.4% from 2.5% in November. 
Interviews for the preliminary December survey were conducted Nov. 20 to Dec. 4.
