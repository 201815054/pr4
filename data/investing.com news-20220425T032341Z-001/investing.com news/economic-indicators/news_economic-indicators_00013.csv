WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retail sales rose in March for the first time since November as consumers stepped up purchases of automobiles and other goods, suggesting a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter was temporary. 
The Commerce Department's fairly sturdy report on Tuesday together with other data showing that producer inflation crept up last month should keep the Federal Reserve on track to start raising interest rates later this year.
An unusually snowy winter undercut activity early in 2015. Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, a stronger dollar and softer global demand also have hurt growth.
""A rebound in retail sales in March provides evidence that the U.S. economy is pulling out of a soft patch seen at the start of the year. The improvement in retail sales ... adds to the likelihood of policymakers voting to hike rates this year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London.
Retail sales increased 0.9 percent in March, broadly in line with expectations. That was the largest gain since the same month last year and snapped three straight months of declines that had been blamed on harsh winter weather.
The sales rebound, which was mainly driven by automobiles, furniture, clothing, building materials, restaurants and bars, was even more encouraging because of the big step back in job growth last month.
But retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services rose 0.3 percent after dropping 0.2 percent in February. The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
U.S. stocks traded marginally higher, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) reporting unexpectedly strong earnings but Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) announcing that it was cutting its full-year earnings forecast due to the impact of the buoyant dollar.
Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while the dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies.
TEPID CONSUMER SPENDING
Last month's mild rebound in core retail sales and February's decline pointed to a slower pace of consumer spending in the first quarter. 
That, however, was offset by a second report from the Commerce Department showing a relatively solid increase in retail inventories excluding autos in February.
Data including for retail sales, housing starts, inventories, trade and manufacturing suggest the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter after a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December quarter.
But with household savings at their highest level in just over two years, thanks to a tightening labor market and cheaper gasoline, there is great potential for consumers to boost spending in the months ahead and cushion the economy against the strong dollar.
""Given the fading headwinds and the considerable war chest that consumers have accumulated in recent months ... we look for GDP growth to re-accelerate in the second quarter,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.2 percent last month, with rising prices for goods accounting for more than half of the increase. The PPI had declined 0.5 percent in February.
In the 12 months through March, producer prices fell 0.8 percent, the biggest year-on-year decline since the revamped series started in 2009.
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.2 percent after being unchanged in February. Core PPI was up 0.8 percent in the 12 months through March.
""From the Fed's perspective there may be a little reassurance here that the spillover from lower energy prices has been limited thus far,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
Low inflation and signs of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter have prompted most economists to push back their expectations for the first Fed rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe the U.S. central bank will only tighten monetary policy in 2016.

The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2015 09:12AM ET</span>",Small business confidence falls; labor indicators weak ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Small business confidence fell in March as hiring and capital spending plans weakened, adding to signs that economic growth braked sharply in the first quarter.
The National Federation of Independent Business said on Tuesday its Small Business Optimism Index dropped 2.8 points to 95.2 last month. The decline in the NFIB is in line with softer data on employment growth and manufacturing.
Economic growth in recent months has been dampened by harsh winter weather as well as a now-settled labor dispute at the normally busy West Coast ports, softer global demand and a stronger dollar.
The economy is estimated to have expanded at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter after growing at a 2.2 percent pace in the final three months of 2014.
""Not a recession scenario overall for sure, but there is not much growth energy in the economy,"" said NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg.
All 10 components of the index fell last month, with sharp declines in labor market indicators.
The share of small business owners saying they could not fill open positions dropped five points last month from a near nine-month high in February, which could see tepid wage growth persist for a while.
That accounted for 15 percent of the decline in the NFIB index last month. In addition, plans to create new jobs fell two points. Dunkelberg said this suggested a softer job market in the second quarter of 2015.
The government reported early this month that nonfarm payrolls increased only 126,000 in March, ending 12 straight months of job gains above 200,000.
The NFIB survey found a two point decline in capital spending plans. The share of small businesses increasing inventories fell three points last month to just one percent.

Businesses were downbeat on prospects for the next six months and the outlook for sales and earnings.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's export sales contracted 15 percent in March while import shipments fell at their sharpest rate since the 2009 global financial crisis, a shock outcome that deepens concern about sputtering Chinese economic growth.
The tumble in exports - the worst in about a year - compared with expectations for a 12 percent rise and could heighten worries about how a rising yuan <CNY=CFXS> has hurt demand for Chinese goods and services abroad, analysts said.
In a sign that domestic demand was also tepid, imports into the world's second-biggest economy shrunk 12.7 percent last month from a year ago, the General Administration of Customs said on Monday.
That was the biggest slump in imports since May 2009, and compared with a Reuters poll forecast for a 11.7 percent drop.
""It's a very bad number that was much worse than expectations,"" Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) in Hong Kong, said in reference to the export data.
""It leads to warning flags both on global demand and China's competitiveness.""
Buffeted by lukewarm foreign and domestic demand, China's trade sector has wobbled in the past year on the back of the country's cooling economy, unsettling policymakers.
Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang was quoted by Xinhua state news agency as saying earlier this month that authorities must act to arrest China's export slowdown lest it further dampens economic growth.
Wang was quoted as saying that local governments should offer ""preferential policy support"" and encourage more private investment in exports.
Anaemic growth in the trade sector could hurt jobs, which the government wants to protect for fear that widespread unemployment could fuel social discontent and trigger unrest.
So far, China's labor market appears to be holding up well, despite signs that economic growth is steadily grinding to its lowest in a quarter of a century of around 7 percent.
Data on growth in the first quarter will be released on Wednesday.
DIFFICULTIES FACED
Last month's trade performance left China with a surplus of $3.1 billion, much smaller than the poll forecast for a $45.4 billion trade gap.
A breakdown of exports and imports by major markets was not yet available on Monday, though many economists said there were few doubts that a stronger yuan - which is pegged to a rising dollar - had crimped export sales.
Indeed, Huang Songping, a spokesman at China's customs office, acknowledged the difficulties that exporters faced from a firmer yuan.
Costs stemming from labor, financing and the exchange rate ""remain stubbornly high and the competitive advantage of the traditional foreign trade has been weakened,"" Huang said.
He added that 56.2 percent of exporters surveyed by the government said their costs had risen in March.
Against the euro <EUR=>, for instance, the yuan hit a record high of 0.15274 euros (CNYEUR=R) on March 16, up a steep 14 percent against the common currency this year.
""The really weak trade surplus has implications for the weakness in the renminbi,"" said Andrew Polk, an economist at the Conference Board in Beijing. ""So we might see more weakness going forward.""
China expanded grew its trade sector by 3.4 percent in 2014, according to government data, missing the government's growth target of 7.5 percent by more than half.

Taking that disappointing outcome into account, the government has lowered its growth target for 2015 combined imports and exports to around 6 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices fell in March as rising petroleum costs were offset by declining prices for other goods, a sign of muted inflation that supports the view the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates in June.
The Labor Department said on Friday import prices dropped 0.3 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices slipping 0.3 percent after a previously reported 0.4 percent increase in February, when prices advanced after declining for seven straight months.
In the 12 months through March, prices plunged 10.5 percent, the largest drop since September 2009.
U.S. government debt prices were largely unchanged after the data, while the dollar gained against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock index futures were mixed.
Lower crude oil prices and a buoyant dollar have dampened price pressures, leaving inflation running well below the Fed's 2 percent target.
Officials at the central bank, some of whom have shown a willingness to consider a rate hike at the June policy-setting meeting, view the low inflation environment as transitory.
But the combination of low inflation and weak economic growth in the first quarter has prompted many economists to push back their rate hike expectations to later in the year.
And some economists believe monetary policy tightening will only begin in 2016. The Fed has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
Crude oil prices have lost more than half their value since June on fears of a global oil glut and the refusal of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to cut output.
At the same time, the dollar has gained about 12 percent against the currencies of the main U.S. trading partners. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) estimates the strong dollar will cut about half a percentage point off both economic growth and inflation in 2015.
Last month, imported petroleum prices rose 0.8 percent after jumping 5.2 percent in February.
Import prices excluding petroleum fell 0.4 percent in March. They had dropped 0.3 percent in February. Imported food prices fell 1.1 percent after being unchanged in February.
The report also showed export prices edged up 0.1 percent last month, the first increase since July, after slipping 0.2 percent in February.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's inflation data for March produced small positive surprises, but remained tepid, with little sign that Beijing's easing measures to date have significantly cut worrisome deflationary pressure.
That has led many to predict more easing measures in the pipeline, including more cuts to reserve requirement ratios for banks, although there is debate over how effective those might be at juicing inflation.
In March, China's annual consumer inflation rate (CPI) stayed flat at 1.4 percent, above a poll's projected 1.3 percent. Producer prices (PPI) fell slightly less than projected, contracting 4.6 percent rather than the forecasted repeat of February's 4.8 percent pace.
The March inflation data is the first in a batch of key economic data that will climax with release of first-quarter growth numbers on April 15. A Reuters poll expects growth to be a six-year low of 7 percent.
PRESSURE ON MARGINS
PPI has now been in negative territory for three years, highlighting sustained pressure on profit margins at Chinese companies - in particular heavy industry - as Beijing struggles to restimulate headline growth.
The higher-than-expected CPI was driven by a sudden rise in pork prices, which been a drag on CPI every month since December 2013.
But consumer inflation is still far short of Beijing's official 3 percent target for 2015, and some economists see that goal at risk.
""Consumer price inflation held steady in March but we expect a drop in food price inflation to pull it lower over the coming months,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a research note.
Producer prices were dragged down again by mining and raw materials components.
Friday's data follows a surprise recovery in manufacturing activity for March, with the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) edging up to 50.1, in expansionary territory, from February's 49.9.
WORRIED POLICYMAKERS
Policymakers have publicly expressed worry that the risk of deflation is rising for the world's second-largest economy, as the drag from a property market downturn and widespread factory overcapacity is compounded by an uncertain global outlook and soft commodity prices.
But while lower commodity prices have punished the extraction and power production sectors, the pain is not felt across the board, as some companies have taken advantage of lower input costs to maintain profit margins.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has made multiple cuts to guidance lending rates, and one cut to reserve requirement ratios at banks. It also launched a long-awaited deposit insurance program in April, but economists said those moves have had little impact on real borrowing costs.
""The weak inflation profile suggests that further monetary policy easing is still needed in spite of recent retreats of onshore money market rates,"" ANZ economists Zhou Hao and Liu Ligang wrote after Friday's data release.
""We believe that only permanent liquidity injection will be able to sustain the current favorable monetary conditions to head off the risk of deflation,"" they said.

The central bank has guided benchmark short-term money rates down sharply in recent weeks, and the interest rate yield curve has risen and steepened slightly as short term rates have fallen while longer term expectations have risen.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose less than expected last week and the four-week moving average of claims hit its lowest level since 2000, suggesting an abrupt slowdown in job growth in March could be temporary.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 281,000 for the week ended April 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Claims for the prior week were revised to show 1,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 285,000 last week. 
U.S. stock index futures trimmed losses and prices for U.S. government debt dipped after the data. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. A Labor Department analyst said there was nothing unusual in the state-level data. Claims tend to be volatile around Easter because of the shifting nature of the holidays. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,000 to 282,250 last week, the lowest level since June 2000. Claims below 300,000 are associated with a strengthening labor market.
Job growth slowed sharply in March, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by only 126,000, ending a 12-month stretch of employment gains above 200,000. But with the weakness mostly concentrated in the weather-sensitive leisure and construction sectors, economists downplayed the slowdown.
Last week's tepid job gains data joined weak consumer and business spending, industrial production and housing starts data in suggesting the economy grew at a sub-1 percent annual rate in the first quarter. 
Activity has been hit by a harsh winter, which is estimated to have chopped as much as seven-tenths of a percentage point from first-quarter growth. A now-settled labor dispute at normally busy ports on the West Coast, softer global demand and a stronger dollar also have weighed on the economy.

Thursday's claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 23,000 to 2.30 million in the week ended March 28. That was the lowest level since December 2000.

The meeting concluded with the Fed opening the door to a June rate hike, and the minutes said that ""several participants"" went on record saying they expected upcoming economic data would warrant an initial rate increase that month.
But even those less certain about the June timing felt the economy had improved enough for the Fed to shift into a meeting-by-meeting assessment of whether rates should move higher.
Even in the face of a weak first quarter, ""participants saw broad-based improvement in labor market conditions ... including strong gains in payroll employment ... While almost all participants noted potential risks to the economic outlook resulting from foreign economic and financial developments, most saw the risks to the outlook for economic growth and the labor market as nearly balanced,"" the minutes said.

Staff forecasts, meanwhile, projected that even though U.S. economic growth had slowed, it would remain strong enough to continue making progress towards the Fed's inflation and unemployment goals - particularly after the impact of a strong dollar and falling oil prices started to ease.

LONDON (Reuters) - Price discounting drove growth in all of the euro zone's major economies in March, helping business activity increase at its fastest rate for nearly a year, a survey showed on Tuesday.
New orders came in at their fastest rate since May 2011 and the survey found that companies have now been cutting prices for three years, although not as sharply in March as before.
Nevertheless, the Markit survey provided some welcome news for the European Central Bank (ECB) just weeks after it embarked on a trillion-euro asset-purchase program.
The private sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, grew at its fastest pace in eight months and although it also increased in France, the pace of expansion slowed.
Italy's service industry returned to growth, fuelling hopes of an economic recovery there after years of on-off recession, and Spain's expanded at its fastest pace since August.
""France is lagging behind a little bit but the others are doing pretty well. It just shows that quantitative easing was working even before the ECB bought a single bond,"" Soctiabank's Alan Clarke said.
""It's vindicating the ECB for what it is doing.""
Official data showed euro zone consumer prices fell again in March as expected but that the decline was the smallest this year. Industrial producer prices declined by less than expected in February from a year earlier.
""Encouragingly for the ECB, there was further evidence in the services survey that deflationary tendencies are easing in the euro zone,"" IHS Global Insight's Howard Archer said.
Markit's final March Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good indicator of growth, stood at 54.0, a touch below the preliminary estimate of 54.1 but well ahead of February's 53.3. A reading above 50 implies growth.
The financial information firm said the PMIs pointed to first quarter growth of 0.3 percent, slightly less than the 0.4 percent predicted in a Reuters poll taken last month. [ECILT/EU]
Price-cutting also helped drive up service industry activity at its fastest pace in eight months. The March services PMI rose to 54.2 from 53.7, just below the flash 54.3 estimate.
With recovery gathering steam and confidence growing because of the ECB's QE program, service companies were at their most optimistic since May 2011. The business expectations sub-index came in at 64.8 compared with February's 64.1.

Sentix research group's index tracking morale among investors and analysts in the euro zone climbed to its highest level since August 2007 this month as they took heart from the European Central Bank's bond-buying program.

(Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept interest rates on hold at 7.50 percent on Tuesday, choosing to wait longer to assess inflationary pressures before making its next move, and to give banks more time to adjust lending rates to reflect previous rate cuts.
Most of the 40 economists surveyed by Reuters had expected the RBI to keep the key lending repo rate unchanged at Tuesday's policy review.
The RBI has cut rates twice this year, by a total 50 basis points, in a bid to bolster economic growth. Both times the reductions took place outside of the regular policy reviews.
Only a few banks have reduced lending rates after the previous central bank rate cuts, raising concerns about the transmission of monetary policy actions to the broader economy.
""With little transmission and the possibility that incoming data will provide more clarity on the balance of risks on inflation, the Reserve Bank will maintain status quo in its monetary policy stance in this review,"" the central bank said in a statement.
However, the RBI said it would maintain its ""accommodative stance on monetary policy.""
Analysts expect the RBI to cut rates again if consumer inflation remains within its target of 2 to 6 percent and so long as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government controls its fiscal deficit and passes economic reforms.
The RBI agreed a monetary policy framework last month that narrows the central bank's goals to securing price stability.
The consumer price index rose 5.37 percent in February, the fifth consecutive month that it has stayed within the RBI's target range. Inflation data for March will be released on April 13.
The RBI will be wary of inflationary pressures as earlier-than-expected rainfall in parts of the country have pushed up prices of winter crops, such as wheat and pulses.
The RBI projected CPI would stay at current levels in the April-June quarter, and fall to around 4 percent by August, only to then firm up to reach 5.8 percent by the end of the year.
The RBI reiterated its target of 6 percent CPI by January 2016 and set a new target of 4 percent by the end of 2017/18, the midpoint of the CPI range.
If inflation were to remain relatively benign, the RBI's monetary policy could be more supportive for economic growth.
The RBI projected economic growth of 7.8 percent in the 2015/16 fiscal year under a new methodology unveiled by the government earlier this year that has raised skepticism among analysts.
That is below the government's forecast of growth of 8 to 8.5 percent in the year started in April."
95,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 07, 2015 12:34AM ET</span>","Reserve Bank of Australia holds at 2.25%, signals more cuts possible","Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia held its cash rate at a record low 2.25% on Tuesday as expected, but said further easing may be appropriate over the period ahead.Below is the full-text statement.Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy DecisionAt its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent.Moderate growth in the global economy is expected in 2015, with the US economy continuing to strengthen, even as China's growth slows a little from last year's outcome.Commodity prices have declined over the past year, in some cases sharply. The price of oil in particular is much lower than it was a year ago. These trends appear to reflect a combination of lower growth in demand and, more importantly, significant increases in supply. The much lower levels of energy prices will act to strengthen global output and temporarily to lower CPI inflation rates. Prices for key Australian exports have also been falling and therefore Australia's terms of trade are continuing to decline.Financial conditions are very accommodative globally, with long-term borrowing rates for several major sovereigns at all-time lows. Financing costs for creditworthy borrowers remain remarkably low.In Australia the available information suggests that growth is continuing at a below-trend pace, with overall domestic demand growth quite weak as business capital expenditure falls. As a result, the unemployment rate has gradually moved higher over the past year. The economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. With growth in labour costs subdued, it appears likely that inflation will remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate.Credit is recording moderate growth overall. Growth in lending to investors in housing assets is stronger than to owner-occupiers, though neither appears to be picking up further at present. Lending to businesses, on the other hand, has been strengthening recently. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have risen, in part as a result of declining long-term interest rates.The Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising US dollar over the past year, though less so against a basket of currencies. Further depreciation seems likely, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy.At today's meeting the Board judged that it was appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the time being. Further easing of policy may be appropriate over the period ahead, in order to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation consistent with the target. The Board will continue to assess the case for such action at forthcoming meetings.

The Institute for Supply Management said its services index fell to 56.5 last month from 56.9 in February. The reading was in line with economists' forecasts, according to a Reuters survey.
The March reading was the lowest since a matching reading last December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
The exports index rose, however, to 59.0 from 53.0 in February to mark the highest reading since February 2013. The employment index also rose, hitting its highest level since last October, with the reading coming in at 56.6 compared with 56.4 in February.
Its index of business activity fell, meanwhile, to 57.5 in March from 59.4 in February and marking the lowest reading in a year.

The rise in the exports index came despite the U.S. dollar's surge against a basket of major currencies of more than 20 percent since last May. A strong dollar typically crimps demand for U.S exports and reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars.

(Reuters) - Growth in India's pivotal services industry lost some momentum in March as input prices rose at the fastest pace in nearly a year, a business survey showed on Monday.
The HSBC (LONDON:HSBA) Services Purchasing Managers' Index eased to 53.0 in March from February's eight-month high of 53.9. A reading above 50 indicates growth, and March was the 11th straight month of expansion.
""India's service sector ended the first three months of 2015 with a strong performance, providing signals that much of the weakness seen in 2014 has been left behind,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economist at Markit.
""Despite softening slightly since the prior month, growth of activity and new business in the country's dominant sector was robust,"" she said.
The input prices sub-index jumped to a nine-month high of 54.3 from February's 51.2 but as firms absorbed most of the added cost burden, they built up a bigger backlog of outstanding work.
A sister survey on April 2 showed that Indian manufacturing growth accelerated slightly in March despite firms pushing up prices.
The mixed data could prompt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to maintain its wait-and-see policy at a meeting on Tuesday.

U.S. employers added 126,000 jobs in March as the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.5 percent, the U.S. Labor Department said Friday. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected net job growth of 250,000 last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting the labor market continues to expand at a solid clip even as economic growth has stalled.
Sustained labor market strength supports views that the sharp slowdown in activity is probably temporary. A host of factors ranging from bad weather to a strong dollar sucked momentum from the economy in the first quarter.
""While the economy has decelerated, the fundamentals remain strong and the labor market points to a pick-up in overall activity in the second quarter,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at McGladrey in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 268,000 for the week ended March 28, the lowest level since January, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had forecast claims at 285,000.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 14,750 to 285,500. 
The bullish labor market tone was also underscored by signs that more people are coming off the unemployment benefits rolls. 
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 88,000 to 2.33 million in the week ended March 21, the lowest reading since December 2000.
The strong labor market, together with an anticipated acceleration in consumer spending signaled by a surge in auto sales last month, should keep the Federal Reserve on track to start raising interest rates this year.
The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell, while stocks on Wall Street rose. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
While the claims data has no bearing on Friday's March employment report as it falls outside the survey period, it should help allay fears of a long-lasting moderation in growth.
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased 245,000 last month, with the unemployment rate holding steady at a more than 6-1/2-year low of 5.5 percent, according to a Reuters survey of economists. 
The economy, which has been hampered by weaker global demand and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as a strong dollar and a harsh winter, also got a boost from an unexpected rise in factory orders in February.
RAYS OF HOPE
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods increased 0.2 percent, ending six straight months of declines. Orders excluding transportation rose 0.8 percent, the biggest gain in eight months.
Downbeat first-quarter growth estimates got a lift from a second report from the Commerce Department showing the trade deficit narrowed 16.9 percent to $35.4 billion in February, the smallest since October 2009. 
When adjusted for inflation, the deficit narrowed to $50.8 billion in February from $54.6 billion the prior month. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its first-quarter growth forecast by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.0 percent rate, while forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers lifted its estimate to a 1.2 percent rate from 0.9 percent.
The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
The buoyant dollar and sluggish global demand combined with better domestic consumption suggest the smaller trade deficit is probably temporary. 
""We will be looking for imports to pick up in the coming months, as consumer spending gains some momentum in the midst of rising employment levels,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. 
The West Coast ports dispute appears to have slowed the flow of imports and exports. 
In February, imports tumbled 4.4 percent to their lowest level since April 2011. Imports of petroleum products were the lowest since September 2004, with the average import price for crude oil at a near six-year low. 
Exports fell 1.6 percent to their lowest level since October 2012. Exports to Canada and Mexico - the main U.S. trading partners - fell in February. Exports to China tumbled 8.9 percent, while those to the European Union were unchanged.

With imports from China plunging 18.1 percent, the politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit dived 21.2 percent to $22.5 billion.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected factory orders to slip 0.5 percent in February after a previously reported 0.2 percent dip in January.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – declined 1.1 percent instead of the 1.4 percent drop reported last month.
Manufacturing has been hit by a strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms.
Some energy firms are either delaying or cutting back on capital expenditure projects.
Softer growth in China and Europe has also weighed on factories, with a report on Wednesday showing manufacturing activity at a near two-year low in March.
A labor dispute at the West Coast ports, which has since been resolved, is still causing disruptions to the supply chain.
Despite February's surprise gain in factory orders, it may be sometime before the sector, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, rebounds. Unfilled orders at factories fell 0.5 percent in February, declining for a third straight month.
Shipments of non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, were revised up to show a 0.3 percent gain in February instead of the previously reported 0.2 percent rise.

But the smaller deficit, which could see economists raise their first-quarter growth estimates, is probably temporary given a stronger dollar and weaker global demand.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit narrowed 16.9 percent to $35.4 billion, the smallest since October 2009.

The now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports appears to have slowed the flow of imports and exports. The strong dollar, weak global demand as well as lower crude oil prices also likely impacted the trade balance in February.
While the smaller trade deficit is positive for gross domestic product, it does little to change views that economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers added the smallest number of workers in more than a year in March and factory activity hit a near two-year low, fresh signs that economic growth slowed significantly in the first quarter.
The economy has been slammed by a harsh winter, a strong dollar and weaker global demand. While the effects of bad weather should start to fade, dollar strength could remain a constraint and limit a rebound in output.
Soft growth may prompt the Federal Reserve to delay an anticipated interest rate increase until September. The U.S. central bank has not raised its key lending rate since 2006.
""The economy hit yet another rough spot in the first quarter ... which is one of many factors that will make it difficult for the Fed to achieve 'lift-off' by mid-year,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
Private payrolls increased by 189,000 last month, the smallest gain since January 2014, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday.
That was well below economists' expectations for an increase of 225,000. Job gains slowed almost across all sectors, with manufacturing payrolls declining for the first time since January 2014. 
The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday. 
While the ADP report has a poor track record of predicting nonfarm payrolls, it raises the risk that Friday's number could be softer than economists are forecasting. A Reuters survey predicted payrolls increased 245,000 last month after rising 295,000 in February.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its national factory activity index fell to 51.5 last month, the lowest reading since May 2013, from 52.9 in February.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. New orders and factory employment hit 22-month lows. Order books shrank and export orders contracted further.
But there is reason for cautious optimism.
Auto sales rebounded to an annualized rate of 17.15 million vehicles in March from a rate of 16.2 million vehicles in February.
That, together with a surge in consumer confidence last month, suggests a pick-up in spending.
U.S. stocks fell, while prices for U.S. government debt rose on the hiring and manufacturing reports. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
WEAK FIRST QUARTER
First-quarter gross domestic product estimates range between a 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent annual pace, setting up what could be a replay of sorts of 2014, when output contracted sharply before rebounding strongly.
The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers estimates that the harsh weather subtracted about 0.7 percentage point from first-quarter growth. 
The strong dollar, which has gained 12 percent against the currencies of the main U.S. trading partners since June 2014, is pressuring manufacturing by making U.S.-made goods more expensive relative to imports. It also is pinching the profits of multinational companies.
Technology giant  IBM  (N:IBM), semiconductor maker  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), industrial conglomerate Honeywell (N:HON) and Procter & Gamble (N:PG), the world's largest household products maker, have warned that the dollar will hurt their profits this year.
In addition, lower crude prices have squeezed oil companies' profits, prompting some to either postpone or scrap capital expenditure programs. 
The sector, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, was hit by supply chain disruptions created by a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports. Manufacturers have continued to complain about the dispute's lingering effects.
Another manufacturing survey produced by financial data firm Markit showed factory activity at a five-month high in March.
""Manufacturers will likely continue to have to contend with a stronger dollar, but we think factory activity will pick up in the coming months as the influence of the more transitory headwinds of the weather and the ports dissipates,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

Separately on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending dipped 0.1 percent in February, restrained by a drop in public construction outlays. January's construction spending was revised to show a 1.7 percent decline instead of the previously reported 1.1 percent drop.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending being flat in February.
Economic growth slowed markedly in the first quarter, held back by bad weather, a strong dollar, weaker overseas demand and a now-settled labor dispute at the country's busy West Coast ports.
Estimates for first-quarter gross domestic product range between a 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
Construction spending in February was restrained by a 0.8 percent drop in public construction outlays.
Spending on federal government projects jumped 9 percent, but that was offset by a 1.6 percent plunge in state and local government outlays - the largest portion of the public sector segment.
Spending on private construction projects was up 0.2 percent as a rise in non-residential outlays made up for a decline in spending on home building.
Private residential construction spending fell 0.2 percent, likely due to the disruption from cold and snowy weather in the second half of the month.

Spending on single-family construction fell 1.4 percent, while multi-family home building rose 4.1 percent.

(Reuters) - Companies struggled in China and much of the rest of Asia in March, suggesting central banks may have to resort to more stimulus, just as factories in the euro zone begin to reap rewards from ultra-easy policy there.
Any indication of recovery will delight the European Central Bank which embarked on a quantitative easing programme in March, aiming to buy around 60 billion euros of bonds every month to drive up inflation and spur the recovery.
But three separate surveys of China's factory and services sectors released on Wednesday showed stubborn weakness in the world's second-biggest economy, putting the government's newly minted growth target of around 7 percent for the year at risk.
""The Chinese numbers don't look too bad but our guess is that the People's Bank of China will ease again. Another cut in interest rates might be on the cards,"" said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec.
""The recent numbers from the euro zone have suggested that the acuteness of the crisis has eased but there remains more work to be done."" 
Markit's final March manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the euro zone was at a ten-month high of 52.2, up from 51.0 in February and the 21st month in a row it has been above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Growing demand for exports helped drive the output index -- which feeds into a composite PMI due on Tuesday that is seen as good growth indicator -- to a ten-month high.
Speculation QE was coming from the ECB, and its eventual launch, has sent the euro  down around 12 percent since January and factories have benefited as it has not only made exports cheaper but also meant competing imports were more expensive.
Bolstered by a similar pick-up in export orders and strong domestic demand, Britain's manufacturing industry grew at the fastest rate in eight months in March.
Stock markets and the dollar saw solid starts to the second quarter on Wednesday, following the upbeat European data. [MKTS/GLOB]
SIMULATING ASIA 
Analysts predict a modest expansion in U.S. manufacturing activity when figures are released later on Wednesday, taking the view that a recent slowdown was a blip related to harsh winter weather and keeping alive expectations the Federal Reserve will start to raise interest rates later this year.
However, hopes that a strengthening U.S. economy and lower energy costs would spur activity in Asia have proved elusive.
""For Asia-Pacific as a whole, we still see limited evidence that those tailwinds, namely the pick-up in U.S. consumer spending and sharply lower oil prices, are boosting growth,"" said Paul Gruenwald, Standard & Poor's Asia-Pacific chief economist.
China's official PMI ticked up to 50.1 in March from 49.9, but a private survey from HSBC (LONDON:HSBA) which focuses on small and mid-sized firms showed factory activity contracted after two months of recovery.
Both reports indicate economic conditions remain sluggish, which may be reflected in China's first-quarter growth figures on April 15. 
""Recent policy actions, such as mortgage rule easing, suggest that concerns at the top level of the government are rising. We believe this suggests that more easing measures, particularly monetary easing measures, will be rolled out,"" said Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief China economist. 
""The March economic activity data are due to be released in the next two weeks. Further confirmation that the real economy is now tracking below the official target will likely prompt easing measures from the PBoC.""
Some are also calling for even more stimulus in Japan, including one of the architects of premier Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" reflationary policies. 
The Bank of Japan must ease policy further at its meeting on April 30, Kozo Yamamoto told Reuters on Wednesday.
""The economy is at a standstill and prices are seen falling ahead. To do nothing isn't an option for the BOJ,"" said Yamamoto, an expert on monetary policy in Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Japanese manufacturing activity expanded more slowly in March than in February as domestic orders contracted for the first time in almost a year, in a worrying sign the recovering economy may be losing momentum. 
Figures elsewhere in Asia provided a sobering read.
In South Korea, exports suffered their biggest fall in two years while factory activity in Indonesia - the biggest economy in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) - contracted for the sixth straight month as output and new orders dropped at the fastest rate on record.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday, edged up to 50.1 in March from February's 49.9.
Although that was stronger than 49.7 predicted by analysts in a Reuters poll, it was barely above the 50-point level that separates an expansion in activity from a contraction, suggesting factory activity remains tepid at best.
In another sign that businesses faced lackluster demand, a separate survey of China's services sector showed the official non-manufacturing PMI fell to 53.7 from February's 53.9, hugging a one-year low of 53.7 struck in January.
""Demand in local and foreign markers remained on the soft side, so manufacturing businesses faced a degree of downward pressure,"" said Zhao Qinghe, a senior analyst at a research center linked to the statistics bureau.
The services sector was the lone bright spot in China's slowing economy last year, expanding strongly and creating more jobs even as activity in the factory sector fizzled.
But activity readings have been uneven in recent months, hurt in part by a sagging housing market, raising concerns that service companies may be finally succumbing to the broader economic downdraft.
Indeed, a separate private survey of China's manufacturing sector showed on Wednesday that it contracted in March after two months of recovery.
The final HSBC/Market China Manufacturing PMI came in at 49.6, slightly higher than a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 49.2 but still below 50.
The official factory survey looks at larger, state-owned firms, while the HSBC (LONDON:HSBA) version focus on small and mid-sized firms which are facing greater stresses such as high financing costs.
Other data so far this year have indicated that the economy has lost momentum despite two interest rate cuts since November, a reduction in the amount of money banks must keep in reserve and repeated attempts by the central bank to reduce financing costs.
Weighed down by a property downturn, factory overcapacity and high levels of local debt, China's economic growth is expected to slow to a quarter-century low of around 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014.
Some economists expect first-quarter economic growth to dip below 7 percent, which could be weakest since the first quarter of 2009, when growth slowed sharply to 6.6 percent.

A combination of harsh winter weather, a now-settled labor dispute at the country's busy West Coast ports, softer global demand and a strong dollar dampened growth early in the first quarter. 
The moderation in activity is a replay of early 2014, when an unseasonably cold winter caused a contraction in output, which was followed by a sharp rebound in growth.
""Rising confidence and home prices adds to the belief that the first-quarter slowdown will be temporary,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  
The Conference Board said on Tuesday its index of consumer attitudes rose to 101.3 this month from 98.8 in February. That was well above economists' expectations for a reading of 96.
While consumers were less optimistic about the short-term outlook, they had greater confidence in the labor market, with the share of those anticipating more jobs in the months ahead increasing significantly. 
The proportion of consumers expecting income growth also rose solidly, which should help to underpin consumer spending.
Consumption, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has been soft in the last three months, despite households receiving a massive windfall from lower gasoline prices. Some of the weakness has been blamed on harsh weather that kept shoppers at home.
""Consumers have emerged from the winter blues. If they spend anywhere as great as they feel right now, then this economy is going to roar over the next few months,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks fell after a sharp rally on Monday. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose. 
WEAK FIRST QUARTER
First-quarter growth estimates range between a 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
Some economists believe that weak first-quarter growth could cause the Federal Reserve to delay an interest rate increase to later this year. 
Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, however, said on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank would have a ""strong"" case to tighten monetary policy in June, adding that transitory factors had weighed on growth in the first quarter. 
A second report showed single-family home prices rose in January from a year earlier, in part boosted by a shortage of properties on the market.
The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 4.6 percent in January on a year-over-year basis after rising 4.4 percent in December. 
Housing has been sluggish amid a dearth of properties, as insufficient equity keeps potential sellers from entering the market. The reacceleration in home prices could see more houses put up for sale.
""This report signaled healthy home price growth – strong enough to make current owners consider listing their homes, but slow enough to keep those homes within buyers' reach,"" said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
""This is an important development ahead of the spring selling season, and should provide upside support for inventory growth in the first half of the year.""
For now, the economy remains in a soft patch.
In another report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its Business Barometer edged up to 46.3 from 45.8 in February. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing sector. 
New orders contracted for a second straight month, while inventories rose sharply. Economists said the persistently weak readings suggested the strong dollar and weak global demand are acting as a drag on manufacturing.

""The manufacturing sector is more exposed than the non-manufacturing sector to the negative effects of dollar appreciation and weaker foreign growth,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2015 11:51AM ET</span>",Wall Street sees lower stock market gains due to rate worries ,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks are forecast to post more modest gains this year than in 2014 as rising interest rates and a firmer dollar partly offset strong economic growth, a Reuters poll found. 
The S&P 500 (SPX) (INX) will rise to 2,200 by Dec. 31, according to the median forecast of more than 40 strategists polled by Reuters in the past week. 
The year-end target, the same as in a December poll, would represent a 5 percent gain from Monday's close of 2,086.24 and a 7 percent increase for 2015. 
But that would be the lowest return since 2011 for the benchmark index, which closed out 2014 with an increase of more than 11 percent, its third consecutive year of double-digit gains.
Strategists are optimistic about U.S. economic prospects for 2015, but they said the market could pull back once the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
The Fed is expected to do so for the first time in almost a decade later this year if the economy, especially the labor market, keeps improving. 
A recent Reuters poll showed the majority of Wall Street's top banks see the Fed acting in September. [FED/R]
""Ultimately we think the market is going to end higher, but it's not going to be a straight line by any means,"" said Dan Suzuki, senior U.S. equity strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, which has a 2,200 year-end target for the S&P 500.
""We're looking for a lot of volatility.""
Strategists lowered their midyear target for the S&P to a median of 2,073 from 2,103 in a December poll and reduced the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) estimate to 18,000 from 18,500.
While concerns about the timing of the Fed's first rate hike will keep investors anxious, the surging U.S. dollar is likely to keep suppressing earnings for U.S. multinationals, strategists said. 
The dollar (DXY) is up more than 24 percent against a basket of currencies since May 1, making it tougher for U.S. companies to compete overseas. 
S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2015 have fallen sharply since the start of the year, and profit growth for the year is now forecast to increase just 1.8 percent from 2014, Thomson Reuters data showed.
""Anyone who has any kind of U.S. multinational exposure is going to be looking for safe havens,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York.
The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 17.2, compared with 12.2 at the end of 2011 and 16.9 at the end of 2014, Thomson Reuters data showed.
There was little consensus among strategists on which sectors were likely to outperform but several liked technology, while they were bearish on energy and materials because of falling commodities prices.
They also expect utilities, which have done well because of extremely low interest rates, to underperform.

The Dow is expected to rise to 18,850 by year-end, 5 percent higher than Monday's close and near the December target of 18,858.

(Reuters) - Germany's jobless rate hit a record low of 6.4 percent in March, data showed on Tuesday, in a positive sign for private consumption which is expected to drive growth in Europe's largest economy this year.
That beat the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a reading of 6.5 percent and was the lowest since German reunification in 1990. It followed a reading of 6.5 percent in February.
The number of people out of work decreased by 15,000 on a seasonally-adjusted basis to 2.798 million, data from the Labour Office showed. That was bigger than the drop of 12,000 forecast in a Reuters poll.
""The job market has returned to full throttle growth in early 2015,"" Berenberg economist Christian Schulz said.
Separate data on Tuesday showed that German retail sales jumped by 3.6 percent in February in real terms on the year as shoppers spent more online and on shops on food, clothes and cosmetic products. The notoriously volatile indicator was, however, down on the month.
Private consumption was a key growth driver in 2014, and looks set to keep propelling the economy this year thanks to low unemployment and robust wage deals, such as in the engineering and public sectors.
Other positive signs for household spending include consumer morale, which is at its highest in 13-1/2 years as cheaper oil leaves more cash in shoppers' pockets for other purchases.
Record low interest rates also give consumers little incentive to save, Schulz said, adding risks like the Ukraine crisis and the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro zone had not yet hit consumer confidence this year.
""Within Germany's golden decade, 2015 looks set to be a year of the consumer,"" he said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. small businesses took out fewer loans last month but borrowing was up from a year ago as firms ramped up investments in their operations, according to data released on Tuesday.
The Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index fell to 119.2 last month from 122.4 in January. Still, the index was up 7 percent from February 2014, signaling a steadily improving sector.
The index gauges borrowing by firms with $1 million or less in outstanding debt.
An increase of 1 percent to 2 percent indicates businesses are borrowing to replace worn out assets, PayNet founder and President Bill Phelan said.
Higher readings signal that firms are investing more to increase their production of goods and services. That could include buying new machinery, purchasing more property or expanding business divisions.
""It tells us that these businesses are investing because they are getting more orders and more purchases from their customers,"" Phelan said.
Small businesses account for nearly half of gross domestic product in the United States, and an increase investments means that GDP will likely increase with a lag of two to five months.
A separate PayNet index showed loan delinquencies of 31 days to 180 days inched up by four basis points from last month to 1.57 percent.
The slight increase was no cause for concern as it indicates cautious use of credit by small firms, Phelan said, adding that defaults will be moderate in 2015.

PayNet collects real-time loan information such as originations and delinquencies from more than 250 leading U.S. lenders.

(Reuters) - Britain's economy expanded at a faster pace than previously estimated at the end of last year, boosted by a strong performance of exports, official data showed on Tuesday.
Gross domestic product between October and December grew by a quarterly 0.6 percent, the Office for National Statistics said, compared with 0.5 percent in a previous reading and matching the pace of growth in the third quarter.
For 2014 as a whole, the economy grew 2.8 percent, revised up from a previous estimate of 2.6 percent and the biggest expansion since 2006.
With five weeks until a closely-fought national election, the figures be welcome reading for Britain's ruling Conservative government.
Real household disposable income increased 2.3 percent compared with a year ago, the fastest rate of annual growth since the start of 2010.
Britain's current account deficit narrowed as a percentage of the economy in the fourth quarter after matching its highest level on record in the previous three months.
But for 2014 as a whole, the shortfall widened to 5.5 percent of GDP, the largest deficit since records began in 1948.
The ONS said the biggest contribution to growth in the fourth quarter came from Britain's long-suffering trade performance which added 0.9 percentage points to quarterly growth in the period -- a sharp swing from the 0.5 percentage point drag in the third quarter.
Household spending, which has been the main driver of Britain's economic recovery, added 0.4 percentage points to growth in the quarter, slowing slightly.

(Reuters) - British consumer morale rose to its highest level in more than 12 years this month, continuing an upward trend which economic polling company GfK said could boost Prime Minister David Cameron's hopes of re-election in May 7's election.
GfK said its monthly consumer confidence index rose to +4 in March from +1 in February, its highest since June 2002. This exceeded all forecasts from 17 economists polled by Reuters last week, after households reported a greater willingness to spend and a more upbeat view of the economy.
Polling was mostly conducted before Chancellor George Osborne's final pre-election budget, and GfK said the initial public reaction to the modest changes in it had been ""muted"".
""If people warm to it over the next few weeks then we may well see a further increase in the index next month,"" said Nick Moon, GfK's managing director of social research.
""A consistently rising index in the run-up to the election is likely to be good news for the government,"" he added.
Despite strong growth over the past 18 months, Cameron's Conservative Party has not built a lead over the opposition Labour Party led by Ed Miliband.
Wages have started to rise faster than inflation in recent months, but Labour says most households are still significantly poorer than at the time of the last election, due to high inflation and weak pay growth in previous years.
A separate survey from polling company YouGov and economics consultancy Cebr on Tuesday showed Britons who think their financial situation will improve in 12 months' time outnumbered those who say it will deteriorate for the first time since records started six years ago."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in February as households used the windfall from lower gasoline prices to boost savings to the highest level in more than two years, the latest sign that the economy hit a soft patch in the first quarter.
Economic growth has been undercut by bad winter weather, a strong dollar, a now-settled labor dispute at busy West Coast ports and softer demand in Europe and Asia. While the slowdown in activity is likely temporary, it could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later this year.
""We expect spending activity to rebound meaningfully in the coming months as the weather setback dissipates, but the very weak tone in the data will likely continue to temper the impulse at the Fed to tightening policy in the near-term,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
The Commerce Department said on Monday that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, edged up 0.1 percent last month after dropping 0.2 percent in January. 
Households cut back on purchases of big-ticket items like automobiles, but a cold snap lifted spending on utilities. 
Economists had forecast spending gaining 0.2 percent.
When adjusted for inflation, spending dipped 0.1 percent, the weakest reading since April of last year, after rising 0.2 percent in January. 
Investors on Wall Street largely ignored the data, focusing attention on a raft of biotechnology merger deals. U.S. stocks were trading higher. 
The dollar gained against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. government debt also rose.
SLOWING CONSUMPTION
Consumer spending, which grew at its quickest pace in more than eight years in the fourth quarter, has lost momentum in part because of bad weather and a greater propensity by households to save money and reduce debt. 
February's soft report prompted economists to further cut their first-quarter GDP growth estimates.
Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers lowered its estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 0.9 percent annual pace.  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) cut its forecast to a 1 percent rate from 1.2 percent, while  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) now sees a 0.8 percent growth pace instead of 0.9 percent.
While households appear to have pocketed the bulk of their savings from lower gasoline prices or used the money to pay down debt, economists expect improved household balance sheets and a tightening labor market to boost consumer spending this year. 
Income rose 0.4 percent last month after a similar gain in January. Savings jumped to $768.6 billion, the highest level since December 2012, from $728.7 billion in January. 
The saving rate rose to 5.8 percent, also the highest since December 2012, from 5.5 percent in January.
""Consumers have a lot of pent-up spending power once the economy gets past the winter doldrums,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
There already are signs that a thaw is underway. 
In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on signed contracts, rose 3.1 percent in February to its highest level since June 2013. That indicated a pick-up in home sales. 
Harsh winter weather has hurt parts of the housing sector.
There was a slight uptick in prices last month, suggesting a recent disinflationary trend had run its course, but inflation remains well below the Fed's 2 percent target.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled on Friday that the U.S. central bank would likely start raising interest rates later this year, even amid low-running inflation. The Fed has held its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. 
A price index for consumer spending increased 0.2 percent in February after falling 0.4 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.3 percent.
Excluding food and energy, prices edged up 0.1 percent after a similar gain in January. The so-called core PCE price index increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months through February.

""This should reassure the Fed that recent low headline inflation readings are the result of transitory energy price declines and that inflation is likely to rise toward the Fed's target over time,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth cooled in the fourth quarter as previously reported and after-tax corporate profits took a hit from a strong dollar, which could undermine future business spending.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its third estimate of GDP. That was unrevised from the forecast the government published last month.
Businesses throttled back on inventory and equipment investment, but robust consumer spending limited the slowdown in the pace of activity. The economy grew at a 5 percent rate in the third quarter.
After-tax corporate profits declined at a 1.6 percent rate last quarter after increasing at a 4.7 percent pace in the third quarter. Corporate profits from outside the United States fell at an 8.8 percent rate, the steepest decline since the 2007-2009 recession.
""Slower profit growth could mean slower investment in the coming months,"" said Thomas Costerg, an economist at  Standard Chartered  (LONDON:STAN) in New York.
Multinationals such as technology giant  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), semiconductor maker  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC), industrial conglomerate Honeywell and Procter & Gamble, the world's largest household products maker, have warned that the dollar will hurt their profits this year.
The dollar gained 7.8 percent against the currencies of the main U.S. trading partners between June and December.
For all of 2014, after-tax corporate profits fell 8.3 percent, the largest annual drop since 2008.
Economists had expected fourth-quarter GDP growth would be revised up to a 2.4 percent rate and after-tax corporate profits would rise at a 1 percent pace.
U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher, as investors bet that the weak growth data would delay a Federal Reserve interest rate increase until later in 2015. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasuries rose.
DOLLAR HEADWIND
A separate report showed consumer sentiment slipped in March, adding to signs that the moderate pace of economic expansion persisted through the first quarter.
The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 93 this month from a reading of 95.4 in February.
The sturdy dollar, lingering weakness in Europe and Asia, harsh winter weather in the United States and a now-settled labor dispute at busy U.S. West Coast ports dampened activity in the first two months of the year.
With temperatures rising, there are signs of some pick-up in activity. But the dollar will likely provide a challenge for domestic manufacturers. First-quarter growth estimates range between a 0.9 percent and 1.4 percent rate.
""The impact of dollar strength and energy price declines may prove too much for GDP to hit the long-awaited 3 percent threshold in 2015, leaving another year of mid-2 percent growth in its wake,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
Businesses accumulated $80 billion worth of inventory in the fourth quarter, less than the $88.4 billion the government had estimated last month.
As a result, inventories subtracted 0.10 percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Restocking was previously reported to have added 0.1 percentage point to output.
The weak pace of restocking, however, removes the threat of an inventory overhang, giving businesses scope to place more orders for goods, which should help to stimulate manufacturing.
Business investment on equipment was revised to show it rising at a 0.6 percent rate instead of the previously reported 0.9 percent pace, likely reflecting the impact of the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which have caused a drop in drilling and exploration activity.
But consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased at a 4.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter instead of the 4.2 percent rate reported last month. It was the fastest pace since the first quarter of 2006.
Consumer spending, however, moderated early in the first quarter as cold and snowy weather kept shoppers at home. Households also appear to have opted to save the bulk of their savings from lower gasoline prices.
Despite slower global demand, export growth was revised higher. But with consumer spending so strong, more imports than previously estimated flowed into the country, resulting in a trade deficit that weighed on GDP growth.

Trade lopped off 1.03 percentage points instead of the 1.15 points reported last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business investment spending plans fell for a sixth straight month in February, likely weighed down by a strong dollar and weak global demand, leading economists to further lower their first-quarter growth estimates.
The Commerce Department's durable goods report on Wednesday was the latest data to suggest economic growth braked sharply early in the year, in part due to bad weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the country's busy West Coast ports.
While economists largely view the slowdown in activity as temporary, softer growth could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later in the year.
""Today's report provides strong evidence that the manufacturing sector is feeling some considerable heat from the stronger dollar,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 1.4 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent dip in January. 
The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have increased 0.5 percent in January. They last rose in August.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies on the dour report, while U.S. stocks were trading lower. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were marginally weaker.
Business spending on capital goods has been hurt by a strong dollar, which has cut into the overseas profits of multinational companies. Lower crude prices also have acted as a drag, forcing oil firms to either delay or cut back on investment projects. 
The dollar has gained about 13.2 percent against the currencies of the main U.S. trading partners since last June on expectations that the Fed will start raising rates this year after keeping its key short-term lending rate near zero since December 2008.
Construction and mining equipment maker  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) warned in January that lower oil prices would hurt its business in 2015. Procter & Gamble, the world's largest household products maker, already has said that full-year sales are likely to fall 3 percent to 4 percent because of the dollar.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.3 percent last month.
GROWTH FORECASTS SLASHED
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, rose 0.2 percent last month after slipping by a revised 0.4 percent in January. They were previously reported to have gained 0.1 percent in January.
That downward revision, together with a modest rise in inventories, prompted JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) to slash its first-quarter growth estimate by half a percentage point to a 1.5 percent annual rate.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cut its Q1 GDP forecast to a 0.9 percent rate from 1.2 percent.
The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank's model forecasts a growth pace of only 0.3 percent for this quarter. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
""Overall, given the usual noise in the data, as well as a melange of other special factors, we do not view the 1.5 percent first-quarter tracking as so far below the 2.4 percent average of the current expansion to raise more serious worries,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
With core capital goods orders falling, overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - fell 1.4 percent last month.
Durable goods orders also were hampered by a 3.5 percent plunge in orders for transportation equipment. Durable goods orders increased 2 percent in January. 
""While we may see improvement in durable orders over the next several months, robust growth is not in the cards given the global economic situation,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
""Weak foreign demand, tough competition from cheaper imports and lower commodity prices will continue to weigh on domestic manufacturers in the foreseeable future.""

Unfilled orders for durable goods fell for a third straight month in February, while order books for core capital goods dropped 0.3 percent after barely rising in January, suggesting that factory activity would be weak in the months ahead.

The effect of those are being reviewed. Another regulator, the Australian Securities and Investment Corp., is reviewing interest-only lending practices by banks.It is too early to expect a material slowing in investor-loan approvals or credit growth in response to APRA's measures because of the pipeline of preapprovals already agreed before the measures were announced, the RBA said. But, it said regulators would see if additional steps are needed depending on the evolution of risk in the housing and mortgage markets.Growth in investor housing loans nationally has continued recently to be about 10.5% in six-month-ended annualized terms, the RBA said.Monitoring risk is important because low housing-loan rates and strong growth in investor housing credit have raised the macroeconomic risks arising from the housing market, the RBA said.""For instance, speculative demand by investors may amplify the housing-price cycle and increase the potential for prices to fall later on. In addition, the rising share of interest-only loans may increase risks because these loans are not required to amortize for a period of time, sometimes five years or longer, leaving households with more debt than otherwise,"" the RBAsaid.Another risk from robust investor activity is that speculative demand may lead to an excessive increase in construction activity and future supply overhang, the RBA said. While there is little to suggest oversupply is likely at the national level some areas at the local level look more vulnerable, the RBA said.It repeated there is risk of oversupply in inner-city Melbourne but this time added higher-density dwelling approvals in inner-city Brisbane as a source of risk.Another new source of building risk is in the commercial-property sector as investor demand for both new and existing developments has been strong despite weakening leasing conditions, the RBA said.In recent years, commercial-property conditions have softened significantly and there are now clear signs of an emerging oversupply in some markets,"" the RBA said.Lenders should pay particular attention to collateral valuations and also be mindful of the collective effects of strong lending activity within particular market segments - even if individual borrowers appear to be of low risk, the RBA said.Household-sector finances are less cause for concern, the RBA said.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2015 01:22PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer inflation firming; new home sales at seven-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rebounded in February as gasoline prices rose for the first time since June, and there were also signs of an uptick in underlying inflation pressures, keeping the Federal Reserve on course to raise interest rates this year.
The economy, which has been on the back foot in recent months, received another boost from other data on Tuesday showing new home sales surged to a seven-year high in February and manufacturing activity gained some momentum in March. 
The upbeat reports came despite harsh weather and a strong dollar, which have contributed to slowing economic activity early in the first quarter.
""It doesn't corroborate the further disinflation story. There is some chance economic activity is going to pick up a little bit this spring, but it's not really clear how much and that matters for the timing of the first rate hike,"" said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut. 
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent last month after dropping 0.7 percent in January, ending three straight months of declines in the index. 
In the 12 months through February, the CPI was unchanged after slipping 0.1 percent in January, as the impact of an earlier plunge in global crude oil prices lingers.
Fed officials have long viewed the energy-driven weakness in prices as transitory and economists said February's firmer readings were in line with policymakers' projections that inflation will move back to the central bank's 2 percent target.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. stocks edged down. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were higher.
While a June move remains on the cards, many economists are leaning towards a September tightening, arguing that the effects of a strong dollar and weak energy prices would continue to influence inflation data through the first half of the year. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week policymakers could raise interest rates when they had ""seen further improvement in the labor market"" and were ""reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.""
DOWNWARD PRESSURE
""In the near-term, the stronger dollar will continue to put downward pressure on imported goods prices,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
""As the dampening effect from the stronger dollar fades in the second half of this year, we would expect to see core inflation gradually strengthen."" 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent in February after a similar gain in January. In the 12 months through February, the core CPI rose 1.7 percent, the largest increase since November.
For now, the signs of inflation are welcome for an economy that has stumbled in recent months under the weight of a harsh winter, weak global demand, the strong dollar and the now-settled labor dispute at one of the country's busiest ports.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new home sales jumped 7.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 539,000 units last month, the highest level since February 2008.
Manufacturing, which has been hurt by supply chain disruptions because of the ports labor strife, showed some strength this month.
Financial information services firm Markit said its U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a five-month high of 55.3 in March from a reading of 55.1 in February. 
Crude oil prices fell 60 percent between June and January on fears of a global oil glut and the refusal of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to cut output. In February, Brent  stabilized at around $60 and U.S. crude at around $50.
Last month, domestic gasoline prices rose 2.4 percent, the largest increase since December 2013, after tumbling 18.7 percent in January. Food prices increased 0.2 percent. 
Elsewhere, shelter costs increased 0.2 percent, accounting for about two-thirds of the increase in the core CPI. 
There were gains in the prices of apparel, airfares, new motor vehicle and used cars and trucks prices. However, the cost of medical care services declined for the first time since 1975.

January's sales pace was revised up to 500,000 units from the previously reported 481,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales falling to a 465,000-unit pace last month.
New home sales are counted at signing of contracts. February's gains came despite cold and snowy weather slamming large parts of the country in the last half of February.
Sales last month soared 152.9 percent in the Northeast, but fell 12.9 percent in the Midwest. Sales in the South jumped 10.1 They fell 6.0 percent in the West.

With sales surging, the stock of new houses available on the market fell 1.4 percent last month to 210,000. At February's sales pace it would take 4.7 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.1 in January.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2015 07:12AM ET</span>","China March flash HSBC PMI contracts to 11-month low, fans policy easing expectations","By Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - Activity in China's factory sector dipped to a 11-month low in March as new orders shrank, a private survey showed, signaling persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy that will likely fuel calls for more policy easing to support growth.
The poor reading added to signs that the economy has lost momentum despite two interest rate cuts since November, a reduction in the amount of money banks must keep in reserve and repeated attempts by the central bank to reduce financing costs. 
The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 49.2 in March, below the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from contraction on a monthly basis. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 50.6, slightly weaker than February's final PMI of 50.7. 
Some analysts expect first-quarter economic growth to dip below the government's new full-year target of 7 percent - widely seen as the level needed to keep employment steady.
""The weaker PMI data could increase pressure for policy loosening,"" economists at CICC said in a research note.
They predicted the central bank would cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) six more times this year, on top of another interest rate cut.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said the next RRR cut may come as soon as April.
Asia stocks fell after the PMI report on Tuesday, with shares in Shanghai skidding more than 2 percent, while the Australian dollar dipped . [MKTS/GLOB] 
However, a separate industry survey released by China Beige Book (CBB) on Monday showed that while Chinese firms grew even more wary of borrowing and investing in the first quarter, they still managed to defend profit margins thanks to lower input costs for commodities and labor.
""With firm performance and the labor market both in decent shape, the absence of heavy stimulus should be surprising only to those analysts who still make policy predictions based on GDP,"" Leland Miller, president of CBB, wrote in the report.
JOB SHEDDING
The PMI survey suggested that manufacturers faced considerable challenges from weaker domestic demand and deflationary risks.
The new orders sub-index fell to a 11-month low of 49.3 in March. New export orders decreased for a second straight month, albeit at a slower pace.
Strains on the job market continued to rise, with the employment sub-index contracting for a 17th straight month and hitting its lowest since the depths of the global financial crisis.
China's leaders have said they would be willing to tolerate somewhat slower growth as long as the labor market remained resilient.
""A renewed fall in total new business contributed to a weaker expansion of output, while companies continued to trim their workforce numbers,"" said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at Markit said.
""Manufacturing companies continued to benefit from falling input costs, stemming from the recent global oil price decline. However, relatively muted client demand has led firms to pass on savings in a bid to boost new work, and cut their selling prices at a similarly sharp rate.""
In Japan, a similar manufacturing survey added to concerns that its slowly recovering economy also may be losing momentum, with activity expanding at a much slower clip as domestic orders contracted.
GROWTH WEAKENING
China's economy faces increased downward pressure this year but the slowdown is stabilizing, with employment and services among the bright spots, Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli said on Sunday.
Weighed down by a property downturn, factory overcapacity and local debt, growth is expected to slow to a quarter-century low of around 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014, even with expected additional stimulus measures.
Data so far in 2015 indicate the new growth target may already be at risk, though the Asia Development Bank said on Tuesday that it still expects 7.2 percent growth this year.
Annual economic growth could slow to 6.85 percent in the first quarter from 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top government think-tank, said in a research report on Sunday.
It expected growth to cool further to 6.8 percent in the second quarter.
China's third-largest listed lender, Agricultural Bank of China Ltd (AgBank) (SS:601288) (HK:1288), late on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected profit and a rise in bad loans as slowing economic growth hit borrowers in the manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors in particular.
Bad loans to manufacturers rose to 3.69 percent at the end of 2014 from 2.86 percent a year earlier. Those to wholesalers and retailers more than doubled to 5.93 percent from 2.36 percent.
Meanwhile, central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan cautioned against loosening monetary policy abruptly, saying that could undermine structural reforms.

The government also plans to run its biggest budget deficit in 2015 since the global crisis to boost spending, but analysts doubt investment will pick up sharply this year given that local governments are hard-pressed by piles of debt.

265,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2015 10:56AM ET</span>",U.S. homes sales up marginally; supply a constraint,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales rebounded modestly in February as a persistent shortage of properties on the market spurred the biggest price jump in a year, a trend that could undermine the spring selling season.
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that existing home sales rose 1.2 percent to an annual rate of 4.88 million units. That left the bulk of January's 4.9 percent plunge intact.
""Insufficient supply appears to be hampering prospective buyers in several areas of the country and is hiking prices to near unsuitable levels,"" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun told reporters.
Economists had forecast home resales rising to a 4.90 million-unit pace last month. 
Sluggish home sales are yet another sign that economic activity slowed sharply in the first quarter, which could further diminish expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in June.
The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt were little changed. 
The U.S. housing index rose 0.33 percent, in line with a slightly firmer stock market. Shares in the largest homebuilder, DR Horton (NYSE:DHI), gained 0.25 percent.  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) rose 0.83 percent, while Pulte Group advanced 0.45 percent.
Tight inventories are hurting sales by limiting the selection of houses available to potential buyers. The lack of supply is also keeping house prices high, helping to sideline first-time buyers.
Last month, the inventory of unsold homes on the market rose 1.6 percent to 1.89 million units. Supply was, however, down 0.5 percent from a year ago. 
Inventory growth should be averaging roughly 5.6 percent at this time of the year, when the market gets ready for the spring selling season, according to the Realtors association. 
The spring selling season, the busiest time of the year for housing, runs from April through August.
Realtors and economists say insufficient equity and uncertainty about the economy's strength were forcing potential sellers to stay in their homes. A recent survey by the Realtors association showed homeowners on average staying in their homes for 10 years instead of the typical seven years.
At February's sales pace, it would take 4.6 months to clear houses from the market, unchanged for a second straight month. A supply of six months is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
With supply remaining tight, the median price for a previously owned home was $202,600 in February, up 7.5 percent from a year ago. 
That was the largest percentage gain since February last year and suggested that the pace of home price increases, which had been slowing after double-digit growth for much of 2013, appears to be reaccelerating.
""Stronger price growth is a boon for homeowners looking to build additional equity, but it continues to be an obstacle for current buyers looking to close before (mortgage) rates rise,"" Yun said.
Apart from tight supply, sales last month were also constrained by harsh winter weather. 
Sales in the Northeast, which was slammed by storms for much of the winter, tumbled 6.5 percent last month. Sales in the Midwest were unchanged.

Sales rose 1.9 percent in the South and jumped 5.7 percent in the West.

Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says although February sales showed modest improvement, there’s been some stagnation in the market in recent months.
“Insufficient supply appears to be hampering prospective buyers in several areas of the country and is hiking prices to near unsuitable levels,” he said.
Yun added, “Severe below-freezing winter weather likely had an impact on sales as more moderate activity was observed in the Northeast and Midwest compared to other regions of the country.""

281,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2015 11:36AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims up slightly; weather hurts factory activity,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose marginally last week, indicating the labor market remained on solid footing despite slowing economic growth. 
Other data on Thursday showed manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowed for a fourth straight month in March, hitting its lowest level in more than a year, while a gauge of future economic activity rose slightly in February. 
Growth has slowed in the first quarter, undercut by a harsh winter, a strong dollar, weaker overseas economies and a now-settled labor dispute at West Coast ports. These are mostly temporary factors that should fade by the second quarter.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday acknowledged the moderation in growth, but maintained its upbeat view of the jobs market, as it signaled it was nearing an interest rate increase by dropping the reference to being ""patient"" from the central bank's so-called forward rate guidance. 
""First-quarter growth will be lackluster due to the weather effects and other transitory issues. We do expect overall economic activity to rebound in the coming months and quarters,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 291,000 for the week ended March 14, the Labor Department said. The increase was broadly in line with economists' expectations. 
Claims have bounced around for much of the winter as harsh weather caused a swing in filings. But through the volatility, the trend remained consistent with a strengthening jobs market.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 304,750 last week.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries were trading lower, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks fell as investors booked profits after Wednesday's rally.
MANUFACTURING SLOWING
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business activity index slipped to 5.0 in March, the lowest level since February of 2014. Last month's reading was 5.2.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. Manufacturers reported a slowdown in new order growth, as well as declines in unfilled orders and the average workweek for employees. Inventories and shipments also fell.
""Manufacturers may be uncertain about future demand following shocks from weather and port disruptions,"" said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at  BNP Paribas  (PARIS:BNPP) in New York. 
Manufacturing also is under strain from a strong dollar, which has crimped the profits of multinational companies, and lower crude oil prices, which have caused oil companies to either delay or cut back on capital expenditure projects.
But the labor market remains bullish despite the impact of weather, the dollar and port disruptions.
The claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for the March nonfarm payrolls report. Claims rose modestly between the February and March survey periods, leaving economists to expect another month of job growth above the 200,000 mark.
""As things stand, we would anticipate another sizeable gain in payroll employment in March which, despite the weakness of current inflation, is why we expect the Fed to begin raising interest rates in June,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The economy added 295,000 jobs in February, with the jobless rate falling to a more than 6-1/2-year low of 5.5 percent. February marked the 12th straight month that employment gains have been above 200,000, the longest such run since 1994.
The Fed on Wednesday said it would need to see ""further improvement in the labor market"" before tightening monetary policy. 
Many economists believe the first rate hike since 2006 could come in June, though financial markets are pricing in a September move. The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December of 2008.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the current account gap, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, increased to $113.5 billion from $98.9 billion in the third quarter.
It was the largest shortfall since the second quarter of 2012 and reflected weak overseas profits and softening export growth due to the strong dollar. 

The fourth-quarter current account deficit represented 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, the highest level since the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 2.2 percent in the third quarter.

While Ms. Yellen indicated that its benchmark Federal Funds Rate could be increased later this year, it will not occur until after the Federal Open Market Committee’s next meeting in April, at the earliest. Yellen added that the timing of the decision will be “data dependent,” and that a rate hike will not necessarily be made in June.
Drawing comparisons with Alan Greenspan by striking a well-balanced tone for the Fed’s short-term outlook, Yellen appeared hawkish with the removal of patience, but dovish with forecasts for weaker inflation and GDP growth. The Fed expects Real GDP to grow between 2.1 and 3.1% for the remainder of 2015, below expectations of a Wall Street Journal survey of prominent economists who predicted growth of 1.9 to 3.7% by year's end. The Fed projects inflation of 0.6% to 0.8% in 2015 and 1.7% to 1.9% in 2016. Last month in testimony before Congress, Yellen said that the Fed wanted to see inflation move toward its target goal of 2% before it raised interest rates.
In spite of the revisions, Yellen went out of her way to note that overall the forecast was not weak. She pointed to improvements in the labor market, forecasts for ""above trend growth,"" and estimates of lowering unemployment to 5% by year's end to underscore her optimism.
“We do see considerable underlying strength in the US economy in spite of what looks like a weaker first quarter,"" Yellen said.
Yellen blamed a stronger dollar, which moved to a 12-year high against the euro last week, for the restrained economic forecasts.
""I don’t have a quantitative estimate to offer, but I certainly expect net exports to serve as a notable drag this year on the outlook,"" Yellen said.
The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the strength of the greenback versus six other major currencies, plunged to 96.75 at the market's close. The index reached 99.68 minutes before Yellen's statement was released. The euro also gained more than 2.5% against the dollar reaching a level 1.0875, days after slipping below 1.06.
Stocks rallied broadly amid the weaker dollar in late-afternoon trading to reverse previous losses earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 227.11 points or 1.27% to close at 18,076.19. Stocks were down on the Dow by about 95 points minutes before the Fed released its statement at 2 p.m. EST. The S&P 500 Composite index and NASDAQ Composite index also rebounded from earlier losses on the day to close broadly higher.
In a signal that investors expect the Fed to raise interest rates shortly, the yield on U.S. 10-Year Treasuries plunged more than 6% to 1.918. Yields on short-term sovereign debt dove even further, as U.S. 2-Year Treasuries dropped by nearly 17% to 0.557.
As expectations of an interest rate hike mounted late last year, several members of the FOMC warned of the consequences of raising rates too quickly. Drawing parallels to the crisis that ensued in 1937, New York Fed President William Dudley and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans described how declining inflation strengthens the case for avoiding premature tightening. More recently, Sweden was forced to cut its benchmark rate to zero following premature rate hikes in 2010 and 2011.
Conversely, Yellen noted that for years research has indicated that major shifts in monetary policy can have a lagging effect on the economy. As a result, the Fed is as cognizant of the risks of waiting too long to raise rates.
""Just as we don’t want to be premature in tightening policy and aborting a recovery that we have worked long and hard to proceed as far as it has, we also don’t want to be behind the curve and beginning to tighten given those lags,"" Yellen said.
The U.S. central bank has kept interest rates at near zero since 2009, following the Financial Crisis."

(Reuters) - The pace of growth in British workers' pay slowed in January, hit by fewer bonus payments, while the percentage of people in work rose to an all-time high, official data showed on Wednesday.
The data was published shortly before Chancellor George Osborne announces his last budget before May 7's national election in a speech which is likely to focus on Britain's economic recovery including surging job creation.
The Office for National Statistics also said Britain's unemployment rate was stable at 5.7 percent, matching its lowest level in almost seven years but above a forecast for another fall to 5.6 percent from economists in a Reuters poll.
Total average weekly earnings, including bonuses, rose 1.1 percent in the month of January compared with the same month a year earlier, slowing from 2.4 percent growth in December.
The ONS said there were signs that companies paid fewer bonuses in January than in December.
Excluding bonuses, pay rose by an annual 1.6 percent in the month of January, unchanged from December.
Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, stood at 0.3 percent in January, pushed down by plunging oil prices.
Osborne has said the long-awaited pick-up in earnings seen in recent months is a sign that his economic plan is working as he and Prime Minister David Cameron try to win a second term in May.
But the opposition Labour Party says the recovery is too little, too late for many workers who have still to get back to their level of earnings before the last election in 2010, when inflation is taken into account.
The Bank of England is also keeping a close eye on wages as it considers when to start raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5 percent.
The BoE predicts wage growth will speed up sharply to reach 3.5 percent by the end of this year.
The ONS said pay, including bonuses, rose 1.8 percent in the three months to January, slower than growth of 2.1 percent in the three months to December.
Excluding bonuses, pay rose 1.6 percent in the November-January period, slightly slower than a month earlier.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had forecast total earnings to rise by 2.2 percent and earnings excluding bonuses to increase by 1.8 percent in the three-month period.
The ONS also said the number of people in employment rose by 143,000 to 30.939 million in the three months through January.
It said the employment rate of 73.3 percent was an all-time high.
The number of unemployed people fell by 102,000 to 1.856 million.
The number of people claiming unemployment benefit in February fell by 31,000, compared with economists forecasts of a fall of 30,000."
304,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 18, 2015 05:45AM ET</span>",House Prices In China Fall At Record Rate,"By Duncan Hewitt -
SHANGHAI -- Property prices fell again in most major Chinese cities in February, amid continuing anxiety about the state of the country’s real estate sector. New house prices declined in 66 of 70 large- and medium-sized cities surveyed, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Prices fell an average of 0.4 percent on the previous month, ending 5.7 percent lower than a year earlier, according to Reuters. It is the biggest year-on-year fall since the national survey began in 2011.
The only major cities that did not see a drop were the southern special economic zone of Shenzhen, where prices rose 0.2 percent, and the central industrial city of Wuhan, which saw no change. Prices for the secondary market also fell in 61 cities, though there were rises in five cities. The bureau blamed the sharp fall partly on February’s week-long Chinese New Year vacation, and predicted that prices would rebound this month. That did not stop the figures attracting widespread attention, however: one Chinese-language news website blared the headline: “Hangzhou house prices back to their level of five years ago?”
Such headlines are a reminder of China’s obsession with real estate prices: while falling prices could be seen as good news for the many citizens who feel that property in the country’s cities has become unaffordably expensive, the slowdown in the market has also raised widespread anxiety. A decade-long boom in the real estate sector, until the past few years, led many families to invest an unusually high proportion of their savings in property, leaving them vulnerable to a drop in prices.
The property sector is also thought to account for some 15 percent of China’s economic output, while land sales are estimated to amount to at least 40 percent of Chinese local governments’ revenues. The NBS also said on Wednesday that new land purchases by developers fell 31.7 percent year-on-year in the first two months of 2015.
Li-gang Liu, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ Bank, said in a note on Wednesday that weak property sales in the first months of the year have played a part in dragging down consumer confidence in China. The bank’s ANZ-Roy Morgan China Consumer Confidence Index fell to a record low in March, he said, though almost two-thirds of respondents still expected China’s economy to experience ‘good times’ next year. Liu noted that “the effect of recent monetary easing has been limited,” and said the government ought to take “more aggressive” measures to arrest economic slowdown.
Nervousness over the real estate market has been fueled by several recent developments: two of the best-known developers in Shenzhen, the southern Chinese boomtown across the border from Hong Kong, are reported to be under investigation for connections to an official detained in anti-corruption investigations. One of them, Kaisa Group, recently narrowly avoided defaulting on its dollar loans, but has continued to seek concessions from creditors, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, Evergrande Real Estate, one of China’s largest developers, headed by prominent tycoon Xu Jiayin, revealed earlier this week that it had taken out an extra $16 billion in loans to help it cope with falling sales.
With total property sales in China down 7.6 percent last year, real estate companies have tried a number of measures to improve sales, including discounting and Internet marketing. And some analysts predict the government may take further steps to boost the market, including lowering the down payment needed for purchases, as it seeks to achieve a growth target of about 7 percent for the year.
Yet while the government has eased some restrictions in many cities, including rules preventing cheap housing loans for a second property, it has been unwilling to do the same in the biggest cities -- Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. One former adviser to China’s central bank said late last year that this was out of fear of stoking a further bubble in prices.
Some analysts say the government may have hit on one possible way of helping developers sell inventory without creating another bubble in house prices, with reports that it may be planning to convert unsold properties into social housing. The Chinese government has promised to build a million new subsidized ‘affordable’ homes this year, as part of a program to construct tens of millions such units during the course of this decade. But so far many developers have been reluctant to participate in the plan, considering the profits to be too low; it remains to be seen whether the current slump in the market will change their minds."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Concern over a U.S. interest rate hike kept sentiment in check at some of Asia's biggest firms, as optimism about the outlook for business over the next six months was near steady in the first quarter, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index  was 71 for the March quarter versus 72 three months earlier. A reading above 50 indicates an overall positive view.
Companies in India were the most upbeat for the fourth straight quarter, logging 97 on hopes that low inflation and aggressive interest rate cuts will boost the domestic economy.
Singapore firms registered the least positive outlook for the third consecutive quarter in anticipation of the first U.S. rate hike in almost a decade, which could happen as early as June. Local banks are likely to match the hike, making mortgages expensive and pulling down demand for property.
""There is significant risk as people may have different interpretations of movements in interest rates in a way that can cause dramatic changes in financial markets,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at INSEAD.
China's reading rose to 54 from 50, as businesses became more optimistic about their future amid central bank efforts to moderate the economic slowdown with looser monetary policy, including successive interest rate cuts since late last year.
Optimism slid the most in Australia where firms reported a score of 70 from 85 in the fourth quarter, as falling prices of commodities tempered sentiment in the resource-exporting nation.
The poll, by Thomson Reuters with global business and management school INSEAD, was conducted over the first two weeks of March. Of 111 respondents, 45 percent reported a positive outlook, 51 percent were neutral and 4 percent were negative.
Participating firms included Japanese beverage conglomerate Asahi Group Holdings Ltd (T:2502), South Korean shipbuilder  Hyundai Heavy Industries  Co Ltd (KS:009540) and Australian building materials maker James Hardie Industries PLC (N:JHX).
RISING RATES, FALLING OIL
Strong U.S. jobs data has fanned expectations of a rate hike in the next few months. Low U.S. rates had prompted investors to flood Asia with cheap, speculative funds that could be pulled out as the rates rise. 
In developed economies such as Singapore, where a property boom is fuelling lending, the knock-on effect of a rise in local rates could make repayments expensive.
""The combination of really rapid lending growth and prospect of rising interest rates is quite worrying,"" said Daniel Martin, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics.
Fear of a U.S. hike is balanced somewhat by relief afforded by a drop in global oil prices, reducing energy costs across the board. Oversupply and limited storage capacity has left the price of U.S. crude at a six-year low.
""The fall in gasoline and energy prices means households have more money to spend, so it's positive for real income,"" Martin said.
Overall, the survey showed Asian firms consider global economic uncertainty as the biggest threat to their six-month business outlook, followed by rising costs and other risks such as regulatory change and increased competition.
PROPERTY TOPS, FINANCE WEAK
Companies in the property sector were the most positive in the survey with a reading of 88, a one-point increase from the previous poll. Retail and drugs followed with 82 and 81 respectively, from 83 and 70.
Financial institutions, dogged by regulatory uncertainty and a lingering hangover from the global financial crisis, were least positive with a score of 55, though that was an improvement from 50 in the previous two quarters.
A robust economic recovery and low interest rates are boosting business at finance houses in Taiwan such as Yuanta Investment Consulting, said the company's chief economist, Aidan Wang. Yuanta plans to expand this year and anticipates an increase in hiring, Wang told Reuters.
Elsewhere, the picture was more subdued.

""Finance firms anywhere in the world are very weak,"" said INSEAD's Fatas. ""It's a combination of the financial crisis, a lack of confidence, and increased regulation which has made business very complex.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts plunged to their lowest level in a year in February likely as harsh weather kept building crews at home, in the latest indication that the economy hit a soft patch in the first quarter.
Bad weather, a strong dollar, weaker overseas growth and a now-settled labor dispute at West Coast ports have put a damper on economic activity in recent months, casting doubts on an anticipated June interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
Still, Fed officials, who started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday, are expected to drop the phrase ""patient"" from their so-called forward guidance on interest rates.
""The winter was brutal. Of course, that makes the job of convincing the markets that it is time to start the return to normal interest rates more difficult,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
""But it shouldn't prevent the Fed from giving itself the flexibility to start when the time is right."" 
Groundbreaking tumbled 17 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 897,000 units, the lowest level since January 2014, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. 
Upward revisions to January's starts and a 3 percent increase in building permits last month suggested that February's decline was likely a temporary setback for housing. Permits have been above a 1 million-unit pace since July.
Economists had forecast groundbreaking at a 1.05 million-unit pace in February. Snowy and cold weather conditions gripped much of the country in the second half of February. 
Groundbreaking plunged 56.5 percent in the Northeast to the lowest level since January 2009. Starts in the Midwest dropped 37 percent to a year low. 
In the West, groundbreaking activity fell 18.2 percent. Starts in the South, where most of the home building takes place, slipped 2.5 percent.
""We find it reasonable to excuse the bad news in the February data because of the unusually cold weather during the month and think a weather-related rebound is likely in March,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
GROWTH ESTIMATES CUT
 Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) cut its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 1.3 percent annualized pace. Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers lowered its estimate to a 1.5 percent rate from 1.6 percent. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter.
U.S. Treasury debt prices rose on the data, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Homebuilder shares fell, pushing the housing index down 0.55 percent, in line with a weaker stock market.
DR Horton (NYSE:DHI), the largest homebuilder, fell 0.23 percent, while  Lennar  Corp (NYSE:LEN) dipped 0.11 percent and Pulte Group fell 0.15 percent. Shares in KB Homes rose while Weyerhaeuser shares edged down. 
With a rapidly tightening labor market expected to push up wage growth and encourage more young adults to move out of their parents' basements and set up their own homes, the outlook for residential construction is favorable.
Already in the fourth quarter, household formation was accelerating, breaking above the one-million mark that usually is associated with a fairly healthy housing market.
While a report on Monday showed an ebb in confidence among home builders in March, that was mostly because of lot and labor shortages. Builders overall remained optimistic of a solid housing recovery this year. 
Last month, single-family homes groundbreaking, the largest part of the market, declined 14.9 percent to its lowest level since last June. 
""Housing starts should climb again next month as the spring selling season begins. However, if sales fail to lift single-family permits this spring, it could spell trouble for the single-family market,"" said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Groundbreaking for the multi-family homes segment dived 20.8 percent. Improving household formation and the lowest rental vacancies in more than two decades should boost multi-family starts this year. 
Single-family permits fell 6.2 percent last month to a nine-month low. Multi-family permits surged 18.3 percent.

320,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2015 05:54AM ET</span>","BOJ chief downplays deflation risk, sticks to inflation target","By Leika Kihara and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said lower energy costs may push consumer prices into negative territory but it won't derail a pick-up in inflation as the economy recovers, signaling that he sees no immediate need to expand stimulus.
Nearly two years into his tenure, Kuroda continues to wrestle with weak prices that have kept alive expectations the central bank will ease again this year to reach its 2 percent inflation target.
The BOJ maintained its massive stimulus program on Tuesday but offered a slightly more downbeat view on prices, saying inflation will hover around zero for the time being.
""Depending on oil price moves, we can't rule out the possibility that core consumer prices will fall slightly year-on-year,"" Kuroda told a news conference.
But he said prospects of improving wages and economic growth will underpin inflation expectations.
""For now, I don't think the underlying slowdown in inflation, driven largely by sharp falls in oil prices, will immediately affect the broad price trend,"" he said.
His remarks echo a concerted signal BOJ policymakers have sent to investors that while they expect inflation to grind to a halt in coming months, they see no need to respond unless the price weakness hits inflation expectations.
""There's absolutely no change to our stance of aiming to achieve our 2 percent inflation target at the earliest date possible with a time frame of roughly two years,"" said Kuroda, who will mark two years in office on Friday.
The BOJ has stood pat on policy since expanding its massive stimulus program in October last year to prevent slumping oil prices, and a subsequent slowdown in inflation, from delaying a sustained end to deflation.
DOUBTS REMAIN
Many analysts, however, remain unconvinced that Japan will see inflation accelerate so quickly.
""Given that Japanese stocks are doing well, there's no need to ease policy now,"" said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.
""However, the BOJ will probably have to push back its two-year time frame when it updates its forecasts in October, which will raise questions about monetary easing.""
At the news conference, Kuroda faced tough questions about the BOJ's pledge - made in April 2013 - that it will hit the price target in two years. One reporter urged him to admit the deadline has become impossible to achieve.
Kuroda emphasized that inflation would turn up in the latter half of the year as companies raise wages and the effects of last year's oil price falls fade.
""I don't think achievement of the price target has become particularly difficult,"" he said.
On Wednesday, Japan's biggest firms will announce wage plans following annual talks with labor unions, the results of which will be key to the success of premier Shinzo Abe's push to drive Japan sustainably out of deflation.

The BOJ hopes companies that reaped huge profits from a weak yen will boost regular pay and help lift consumption.

323,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 17, 2015 12:45AM ET</span>","Bank Of Japan Maintains Aggressive Stimulus, But Cuts Inflation Outlook","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - The Bank of Japan maintained its massive stimulus program on Tuesday and signaled its conviction that a steady economic recovery will help achieve its ambitious price target without immediate, additional monetary easing.
The central bank, however, offered a slightly more downbeat view on the price outlook, though it stressed the slowdown in inflation was due to temporary declines in oil prices.
As widely expected, the BOJ maintained its stimulus program that pledges to print money at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen (444 billion pounds).
""Japan's economy is expected to continue recovering moderately as a trend,"" the BOJ said in a statement issued after the decision.
BOJ policymakers have sent a concerted signal to investors that while they expect inflation to grind to a halt in coming months, they see no need to respond unless the price weakness hits inflation expectations.
""Annual consumer inflation is seen moving around zero percent for the time being on declines in energy prices,"" the BOJ said. That was a slightly less optimistic view than last month, when it said inflation will ""slow for the time being.""
A slump in oil prices has slowed annual core consumer inflation to 0.2 percent in January, well below the BOJ's 2 percent target, keeping alive expectations the central bank will top up its already aggressive asset-buying program this year.
""For the time being, the BOJ can continue to argue that the slowdown in inflation is due to supply-side problems in the oil market. Given that Japanese stocks are doing well, there's no need to ease policy now,"" said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.
""However, the BOJ will probably have to push back its two-year timeframe (for hitting its price target) when it updates its forecasts in October, which will raise questions about monetary easing.""
At his post-meeting briefing, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda is likely to reiterate that continued improvements in the economy will nudge companies into raising wages and capital expenditure, helping Japan hit its 2 percent inflation target in the year beginning in April.
Japan's economy is emerging from last year's recession thanks to a much-awaited rebound in exports and factory output.
But private consumption remains soft as households continue to curb spending after being hit by last year's tax hike and the rising cost of living from a weak yen.
On Wednesday, Japan's biggest firms will announce wage plans following annual talks with labor unions, the results of which will be key to the success of premier Shinzo Abe's push to drive Japan sustainably out of deflation.

325,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 16, 2015 08:59PM ET</span>",RBA minutes show scope for further cash rate cut from record low 2.25%,"Investing.com - A cash rate cut to a record low 2.25% in February needs to work its way through the economy, but a further cut may be appropriate, the Reserve Bank of Australia said in minutes from its March meeting released on Tuesday.For the full text of the minutes see below.Members PresentGlenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, John Fraser (Secretary to the Treasury), Heather Ridout AO, Catherine TannaOthers PresentGuy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Malcolm Edey (Assistant Governor, Financial System), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Luci Ellis (Head, Financial Stability Department), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary)International Economic ConditionsMembers commenced their discussion of international economic conditions by observing that growth of Australia's major trading partners had been around its long-run average in 2014 and that recent indicators suggested a continuation of this pace into 2015. Although oil prices had increased a little over the past month, consistent with signs that supply from some higher-cost sources could grow less rapidly over the period ahead, prices had remained at relatively low levels. Members noted that low oil prices should boost global growth, with the effect largest in economies that imported most of their oil, such as the euro area and Japan. Lower oil prices had also led to lower headline inflation and members observed that core inflation, which abstracts from the direct effects of changes in energy prices, was also low in many economies.New data from China were limited as a result of the Chinese New Year holidays. Manufacturing PMIs had remained around their average levels of the past couple of years, while residential property prices had fallen further over recent months, albeit at a slower pace. Lower growth in the demand for steel for residential construction had contributed to falling Chinese steel prices. Consistent with weaker growth in steel production and competition from lower-cost international producers of iron ore, domestic production of iron ore had moderated over the past six months. Total imports of iron ore, including from Australia, had held up over this period. Inflationary pressures remained subdued.In the December quarter, growth had resumed in Japan and growth in east Asia had continued around its decade-average pace. More recent data suggested that growth in these economies continued in early 2015 at around the pace recorded in the December quarter, supported by lower oil prices. Members noted that business investment had made a significant contribution to growth in east Asia over the past couple of years and that Japanese exports had picked up following the depreciation of the yen. Recent growth in India had been revised significantly higher, while inflation had declined noticeably.The US economy grew at an above-trend pace in the December quarter and recent data suggested that this pace had continued into 2015. Members noted that private demand, particularly business investment, had grown strongly over the past year. Consumption had also increased strongly, supported by further improvement in labour market conditions, lower gasoline prices and accommodative monetary policy.Economic activity in the euro area had continued to recover slowly, with inflation remaining well below the target set by the European Central Bank (ECB).Domestic Economic ConditionsMembers noted that a range of indicators suggested that Australian GDP growth continued at a below-trend pace in the December quarter and over the course of 2014. These indicators had suggested that growth of consumption, dwelling investment and public demand were likely to have increased, but that business investment was likely to have fallen further, largely reflecting further steep declines in mining investment.Growth of retail sales volumes had picked up to an above-average pace in the December quarter and liaison suggested that the value of retail sales had increased in January. Real household incomes had been buoyed by the recent decline in oil prices and measures of consumer sentiment were around average levels. However, income growth had remained low by historical standards, which was likely to dampen future consumption growth. There had been further broad-based evidence of spare capacity in the labour market. The unemployment rate had continued its gradual upward trend of the past few years and average hours worked had remained subdued. Nevertheless, members noted that employment growth had picked up over the past year. Members also observed that wage growth outcomes had been low in the December quarter, consistent with ongoing spare capacity in the labour market and pressures on employers to contain costs. Data from surveys and information from liaison suggested that wage growth in the private sector was likely to remain around its recent pace over coming quarters and also pointed to modest employment growth over the same period.Members discussed the extent to which accommodative monetary policy and ongoing strength in housing market activity would support consumption growth in the near term. They noted that the interest payments made by borrowers are significantly larger than the income received by holders of interest-bearing assets and, as a result, the very low level of interest rates was acting, other things equal, to support aggregate disposable income available for consumption. Members noted that the net effect on consumption through this transmission channel was a function of a number of factors, including the distribution of loans and interest-bearing assets across households and the extent to which the consumption behaviour of different households responds to low interest rates.The current strength of housing construction and the increase in housing prices were expected to provide a measure of support for consumption. Housing price growth remained strongest in Sydney and to a lesser extent Melbourne, while price rises in other parts of the country had been more modest and prices had even declined in some cities recently. A range of indicators, including residential building approvals, suggested further strong growth of dwelling investment in the near term. Growth in housing credit for owner-occupiers had remained around 6 per cent in six-month-ended annualised terms, while growth in credit for housing investors was noticeably faster, at over 10 per cent measured on the same basis.Members noted that recent data on capital expenditure and non-residential work done had been consistent with earlier expectations that business investment would decline in the December quarter, largely owing to lower mining investment. The ABS survey of capital expenditure intentions implied further large falls in mining investment, as current projects were completed and few new projects were likely to proceed. The survey implied that non-mining investment would remain subdued for some time yet and for longer than had been previously expected. Members discussed the extent to which early estimates of future capital expenditure provide a reliable guide to final estimates, as well as the relationship between the capital expenditure survey and the measure of business investment in the national accounts. Overall, survey measures of business conditions had remained around their average levels, while the trend in non-residential building approvals was at a low level and conditions in the commercial property market remained weak, with office vacancy rates in all capital cities at high levels.Available data suggested that export volumes rose slightly in the December quarter, as increases in non-bulk commodity exports offset declines in coal, service and rural exports. Exports of iron ore volumes were estimated to be little changed.Financial MarketsMembers observed that global financial markets continued to focus on developments in Greece over the past month, particularly the negotiations between the new Greek Government and its creditors ahead of the expiry of Greece's financial assistance program at the end of February. Although Greece had reached an agreement to negotiate a four-month extension of its program, any extension was contingent on the proposed structural reforms being viewed as sufficiently comprehensive by each of the European Commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund. Sizeable deposit outflows from Greek banks in recent months and a lack of access to private wholesale funding had significantly increased their dependence on ECB funding. Members noted that these developments had led to little contagion to other European countries to date, in contrast to the situation in the 2010 to 2012 period.Market expectations for increases in the US federal funds rate had been brought forward over February, following better-than-expected employment data. It remained the case, however, that the market's implied future tightening of monetary policy was considerably more drawn out than the expectations of members of the Federal Open Market Committee, as published in December 2014. In Europe, the ECB was scheduled to commence buying government bonds in March and several central banks on the border of the euro zone – including Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland – had implemented negative interest rates to address continuing upward pressure on their exchange rates against the euro.Government bond yields in the United States had tended to increase over February, unwinding part of the large declines over January. German 10-year bond yields were largely unchanged and had traded below those in Japan for the first time in around three decades. Domestically, movements in longer-term government bond yields broadly tracked those in the United States, but the spread to US yields continued to narrow to be the lowest since 2006.Members noted that equity prices in advanced economies had increased by 5 per cent over February, while those in emerging markets had increased by a little less. Notably, Australian equity prices had risen by more than 5 per cent over the past month, and by 10 per cent over the year to date, with corporate earnings announcements having generally been in line with, or a little better than, analysts' expectations.There had been little change in exchange rates over February, including for the Australian dollar. An increase in net private capital outflows from China had resulted in net sales of Chinese foreign exchange reserves in recent months, with the renminbi at the bottom of its trading band against the US dollar.Australian lenders had passed on the reduction in the cash rate in February to housing and business borrowing rates. Most banks had also adjusted their deposit rates lower by 25 basis points, which had followed reductions in term deposit and bonus saver deposit rates of around 15 basis points in January.Members concluded their discussion with the observation that financial markets were expecting another reduction in the cash rate target by May, with around a 50 per cent probability of the reduction occurring at the present meeting.Financial StabilityMembers were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system.Volatility in global financial markets had increased from the unusually low levels of a few months earlier. Financial systems had so far been resilient to some large price movements. However, regulators globally remained concerned that ‘search for yield’ behaviour could ultimately lead to disruptive repricing in financial markets. Members observed the heightened uncertainty regarding developments in Russia and Greece, and that most banks in the major advanced markets, including Australia, had relatively little direct exposure to these economies.Members noted that conditions in the major global banking systems had continued to improve gradually. Profitability had increased overall and asset non-performance rates had declined even in the euro area, which had been the last of the major global banking sectors to begin to recover. However, credit growth and lending conditions remained relatively subdued, particularly in Europe, where low nominal income growth was exacerbating risks in the financial sector. In contrast to some major advanced economy banking systems, growth of credit in some Asian economies had remained rapid. Although this could be a sign of developing risk, non-performing loan rates at this stage remained low.In Australia, risks in the household sector continued to be centred on housing and mortgage markets. The composition of these markets remained skewed to investor activity, especially in Sydney. Members noted that, at the margin, the recent decline in interest rates could boost the housing market, including prices. The measures announced by the Australian  Prudential  (LONDON:PRU) Regulation Authority and Australian Securities and Investments Commission in December were designed to temper the housing market risks faced both by households and lenders, although these risks also needed to be placed in the context of the prevailing low levels of household stress.Members further noted that risks had been beginning to build in commercial property markets, including developers of residential as well as non-residential property. Prices in several market segments had been rising, even as vacancy rates remained high and leasing conditions weakened. Outside of commercial property, risks to financial stability from the non-financial business sector generally appeared low and failure rates had been declining.Members observed that the domestic financial sector had continued to perform strongly. Banks' domestic asset performance had continued to improve over the second half of 2014, especially for commercial property and other business lending. Non-performance rates on Australian banks' overseas assets had also declined, although the authorities in New Zealand had expressed concerns about rapid growth in housing prices and the indebtedness of the agricultural sector. Nevertheless, profitability of the Australian banking sector remained robust and the major banks continued to accumulate capital organically, leaving them well placed to meet any further increases in capital targets in the period ahead.Members were briefed on recent developments in international regulation, including macroprudential measures announced in a range of countries over recent years.Considerations for Monetary PolicyIn assessing the appropriate stance for monetary policy in Australia, members noted that the outlook for global economic growth had not changed, with Australia's major trading partners forecast to grow by around the average of recent years in 2015. Lower oil prices were expected to boost growth in major trading partners and reduce inflation temporarily. More generally, although the decline in many commodity prices over the past year had largely been in response to expansions in global supply, members observed that demand-side factors, including the weakness in Chinese property markets, had also played a role. Although the Australian dollar had depreciated, particularly against the US dollar, it remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. Conditions in global financial markets remained very accommodative. Changes to the stance of monetary policy by the major central banks were likely to be important influences on financial markets over the coming year.Data available at the time of the meeting suggested that the Australian economy had continued to grow at a below-trend pace in the December quarter and that domestic demand growth had remained weak overall. There had been some evidence suggesting that growth of dwelling investment and consumption had picked up in the December quarter, but there had also been indications that business investment could remain subdued for longer than had been previously expected. On balance, the evidence suggested that labour market conditions were likely to remain subdued and the economy would continue to operate with a degree of spare capacity for some time. As a result, wage pressures were expected to remain contained and inflation was forecast to remain consistent with the target over the next year or so, even with a lower exchange rate.At the same time, activity in the housing market had remained strong. Housing prices had continued to increase strongly in Sydney and at a solid pace in Melbourne. In other capital cities, trends had been more mixed and annual increases in capital city housing prices (excluding Sydney and Melbourne) had averaged about 3 per cent. Growth of dwelling investment was estimated to have picked up in the December quarter and was expected to remain at a high level in the near term. While credit had continued to grow a little faster than incomes, household leverage had not increased significantly and the Bank would continue to work with other regulators to assess and contain risks that might arise from the housing market.Members noted that the current setting of monetary policy had been accommodative for some time and that the recent reduction in the cash rate would provide some further support to the economy. They also acknowledged that a lower exchange rate would help achieve balanced growth in the economy. Nonetheless, on the basis of the current forecasts for growth and inflation, members were of the view that a case to ease monetary policy further might emerge.In considering whether or not to reduce the cash rate further at this meeting, members saw benefit in allowing some time for the structure of interest rates and the economy to adjust to the earlier change. They also saw advantages in receiving more data to indicate whether or not the economy was on the previously forecast path. Further, they noted the greater degree of uncertainty about the behaviour of borrowers and savers in a world of very low interest rates. Taking account of all these factors, members judged it appropriate to hold the cash rate steady for the time being, while recognising that further easing over the period ahead may be appropriate to foster sustainable growth in demand while maintaining inflation consistent with the target.The DecisionThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.25 per cent.

Factory production slipped 0.2 percent last month after a revised 0.3 percent decline in January, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. Auto production fell 3.0 percent last month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that manufacturing output would edge up 0.1 percent in February after a previously reported 0.2 percent gain in January.
Mining output dropped 0.2 percent last month, primarily due to declines in the coal, oil and gas well drilling, and servicing sectors. Utilities production jumped 7.3 percent as a cold snap boosted demand for heating.
The rise in utilities, however, was insufficient to offset the drag from manufacturing and mining, leaving overall industrial production gaining only 0.1 percent in January.
The amount of manufacturing capacity in use slipped to 77.3 percent last month from 77.6 percent in January.
Overall industrial capacity use dipped to 78.9 percent from 79.1 percent.

337,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 16, 2015 03:45AM ET</span>",China's Fiscal Income Growth Cools As Economy Slows,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Growth in China's fiscal revenue cooled to its slowest in at least a year between January and February as China's foundering economy dampened tax collection and other key sources of government income.
Fiscal revenue rose 3.2 percent to 2.57 trillion yuan ($410.5 billion) in the first two months of the year, data from the Finance Ministry showed on Monday.
That was far less than an average 8.6 percent gain in fiscal income seen in 2014, and the slackest pace seen in at least a year.
Indeed, a breakdown of the figures showed taxes collected from the real estate sector fell 1.6 percent to 96.5 billion yuan in the first two months of the year as China's housing industry stumbled.
China's cooling housing sector, which accounts for about 15 percent of the Chinese gross domestic product, has been an increasing drag on the world's second-biggest economy as a glut of unsold homes dampened home prices and property investment.
Official data showed property sales in the first two months of 2015 dropped by the most in three years as real estate investment eased.
And in a reflection of the sagging housing sector, government revenue earned from selling state land tumbled 20.9 percent to 391 billion yuan.
Collection of income taxes also dropped 7.1 percent to 164.6 billion yuan, while consumption tax and import value-added tax skidded 9.7 percent to 194.8 billion yuan.
Tariffs also fell 5.3 percent to 40.9 billion yuan as plunging crude oil, iron ore and commodity prices reduced the value of imports.
On the other side of the ledger, fiscal expenditure rose 10.5 percent in the first two months of the year from the year-ago period, outstripping an average rise of 8.2 percent in 2014.
The spike in expenditure was a result of regional governments ramping up their spending to support the faltering economy, the Finance Ministry said.
Government spending on social security and employment climbed 15.6 percent to 331 billion yuan, and expenditure on housing benefits for low-income groups jumped over a fifth to 39.3 billion yuan."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell in February for a fourth straight month, pointing to tame inflation that could argue against an anticipated June interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
The Labor Department said on Friday its producer price index for final demand declined 0.5 percent as profit margins in the services sector, especially gasoline stations, were squeezed, and transportation and warehousing costs fell.
""The underlying message appears to be that pipeline inflationary pressures remain quite weak, even as energy prices have stabilized and gasoline prices have drifted modestly higher,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
The PPI had dropped 0.8 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, producer prices fell 0.6 percent, the first decline since the series was revamped in 2009.
Economists had forecast the PPI rising 0.3 percent last month and remaining unchanged from a year ago.
Prices for U.S. government debt gained marginally on the inflation data. U.S. stock indexes fell sharply, as a strong dollar threatened to erode the profits of multinational companies and tumbling crude prices pressured energy firms including  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) and  Noble Corp  (NYSE:NE).
While the weak inflation backdrop would normally be associated with a struggling economy, there appears to be little reason to worry given the fairly robust labor market.
""We would not take the producer prices report as a sign that the economy is secretly rotten if you pull back the tarp and take a look at the hull. The economy is creating millions of jobs,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
A separate report from the University of Michigan showed its consumer sentiment index fell 4.2 points to 91.2 in early March. Lower-income and middle-income households said harsh winter weather had left them with high utility bills and disrupted shopping and general business activity.
Bad weather and a now-settled labor dispute at ports on the West Coast undercut economic activity early in the year. 
First-quarter GDP growth estimates range as low as a 1.2 percent annual rate and as high as a 2.2 percent rate. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
JUNE HIKE STILL IN PLAY
The inflation data came ahead of next week's Fed meeting, where policymakers are widely expected to signal the U.S. central bank's openness to a June rate hike by dropping a pledge to be ""patient"" in considering such a move because of labor market strength.
With price pressures remaining muted and retail sales extending their decline in February, the Fed could delay the move until September. 
""The Fed is probably going to hike even if inflation stays low, whether it's June or September, because they are confident about the strong labor market conditions ultimately leading to higher inflation,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS (LONDON:RBS) in Stamford, Connecticut.
The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
Services accounted for 70 percent of the decline in the PPI last month. The volatile trade services component, which mostly reflects profit margins at retailers and wholesaler, fell a record 1.5 percent in February. 
It was pulled down by a 13.4 percent drop in margins at gasoline service stations, reflecting a recent plunge in prices at the pump. Profit margins also fell for apparel, footwear and jewelry retailers, as well as for food and alcohol.
There also were declines in machinery, equipment, parts and supplies wholesale margins, signs that a strong dollar - it has appreciated more than 17 percent since July on a trade-weighted basis - was helping to keep a lid on inflation.
A 1.5 percent drop in transportation and warehousing services also weighed on producer prices last month. Energy prices, which had been a drag on producer inflation in recent months, were unchanged in February. 
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services was unchanged after a record 0.3 percent drop in January.

""It suggests that the stronger dollar and second-round effects from the decline in energy are still suppressing pipeline inflation,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) in New York.

The University of Michigan's preliminary March reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 91.2, down from the final February reading of 95.4. It was below the median forecast of 95.5 among economists polled by Reuters.
""Consumer optimism slipped in early March among lower- and middle-income households (-6.5 percent from February) while confidence improved among households with incomes in the top third (+3.2 percent),"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
""Despite the small temporary setbacks, the overall level of consumer confidence remains favorable enough to support 3.3 percent growth rate in personal consumption expenditures during 2015,"" he said. 
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 103 from 106.9 in February and below a forecast of 105.7.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations slipped to 83.7 from 88 and was below an expected 87.5.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation rose to 3.0 percent, marking the highest level since last September, from 2.8 percent. The survey's five-year inflation outlook was at 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly fell in February as harsh weather kept consumers from auto showrooms and shopping malls, tempering the outlook for first-quarter growth and a June interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
Even accounting for the snowy and cold weather, which blanketed much of the country in late February, there is little doubt that consumer spending has slowed significantly after robust growth in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
""This report points to a surprisingly bigger weather impact on spending activity than previously thought. The weakness in spending could potentially complicate the case for a mid-year hike by the hawkish members of the Fed,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in the New York
The Commerce Department said on Thursday retail sales dropped 0.6 percent as receipts fell in almost all categories, marking the third straight month of declines. 
Sales fell 0.8 percent in January. February was the first time since 2012 that retail sales had dropped for three consecutive months. Economists had forecast retail sales increasing 0.3 percent last month. 
The Fed had been widely expected to remove a reference to being ""patient"" in deciding when to raise rates at next week's two-day meeting, putting a June rate increase in play. 
Some economists and traders think the U.S. central bank may want to wait longer to be certain any weakness early in the year was temporary. The cool-off in economic activity has been blamed on the bad weather and the now-settled labor dispute at the country's West Coast ports, which disrupted the supply chain.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as traders bet against a June rate lift-off, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose.
WEAK SALES VS STRONG LABOR MARKET
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services were flat after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent dip in January. The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Core retail sale have been downbeat since December. February's weak reading and January's revision prompted economists to cut their first-quarter GDP growth estimates by as much as six-tenths of a percentage point to as low as a 1.2 percent annual rate.
The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. With the labor market rapidly firming, the moderation in growth is likely to be temporary.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 289,000 for the week ended March 7.
That was well below economists' expectations for a drop to only 305,000 and unwound much of the prior two weeks' increases, which had pushed claims well above the 300,000 mark. 
Economists are confident economic activity will accelerate in the second quarter of the year, also as consumer spending gets a tailwind from the massive savings from the lower gasoline prices in late 2014 and early this year.
Most believe consumers saved the bulk of the windfall from cheaper prices at the pump and expect the money to be spent starting in March as temperatures warm up. 
Prospects for a pick-up in spending were also brightened by a report from the Fed showing household net worth posted its biggest rise in a year, rising $1.52 trillion to $82.91 trillion in the fourth quarter.
""Consumers may have throttled back spending, but they maintain the ability and means to spend,"" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist at the National Retail Federation. ""With the onset of warmer, spring-like temperatures and an earlier Easter, consumers will likely shake off the winter chills.""
The weakness in sales last month was fairly broad-based, underscoring the impact of the weather.
Automobile sales tumbled 2.5 percent, the largest drop in a year. Sales at clothing stores were flat. Receipts at building material and garden equipment stores fell 2.3 percent, the biggest decline since May 2012. 
Sales at restaurants and bars slipped 0.6 percent, the largest fall in a year. There were also declines in furniture and electronic and appliances sales.
Receipts at online stores, however, rose as did sales at sporting goods and hobby shops.
A recent rise in gasoline prices lifted receipts at service stations, where sales rose 1.5 percent, the first increase since May. Gasoline prices rose about 9 cents in February. 
Prices at the pump had been dropping since July last year in tandem with falling crude oil prices.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday business inventories were also unchanged in December after previously being reported to have increased 0.1 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories gaining 0.1 percent in January. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, edged up 0.1 percent after being flat in December. 
That could see economists lower their first-quarter GDP growth estimates. Growth forecasts for the January-March quarter currently range between an annualized pace of 1.7 percent and 2.5 percent.
Economic activity early in the year was hurt by a harsh winter and the now-settled labor dispute at the country's West Coast ports, which disrupted the supply chain. The economy grew at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
In January, business sales fell 2.0 percent, the biggest decline since March 2009, after falling 1.0 percent in December.
At January's sales pace, it would take 1.35 months for businesses to clear shelves, the highest inventory-to-sales ratio since July 2009. 
The rise in the ratio from 1.33 in December could be a sign that inventories are now probably approaching levels that might make businesses uncomfortable about adding more stocks.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said the country's goods trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted £8.41 billion in January from a deficit of £9.93 billion in December. Economists had expected the goods trade deficit to narrow to £9.7 billion in January.
Seasonally adjusted, the U.K.’s deficit on trade in goods and services was estimated to have been £0.6 billion in January, compared with £2.1 billion in December. This reflects a deficit of £8.4 billion on goods, partially offset by an estimated surplus of £7.8 billion on services.
The sharp narrowing of the deficit reflects a fall of £2.5 billion in imports. Almost half of this fall (£1.2 billion) is attributed to oil imports.
In the 3 months to January, the U.K.'s deficit on trade in goods and services was estimated to have been £4.4 billion. The latest 3 monthly deficit is the smallest since the 3 months to October 2000.
This mainly reflects a 7.3% rise in exports of goods to countries outside the European Union and falls in imports of goods from both EU and non-EU countries.
U.K. trade data shows the extent of import and export activity, a key contributor to the overall economic growth of the U.K.

However, volatility in financial markets has increased since late-2014 following the sharp drop in oil prices, continued uncertainty about the global outlook and US monetary policy, and policy easings by a number of central banks.Trading partner growth in 2015 is expected to continue at a similar pace to 2014. Growth remains robust in the US, but has slowed recently in China.World oil prices are about 50 percent below their June-2014 peak, more reflecting increased supply than demand factors. The fall in oil prices is net positive for global economic growth, but will further reduce inflation in the near term, at a time when global inflation is already very low.The domestic economy remains strong. The fall in petrol prices has increased households’ purchasing power and lowered the cost of doing business. Employment and construction activity are strong. Net immigration remains high, and monetary policy continues to be supportive. The housing market is showing signs of picking up, particularly in Auckland. However, there are a number of factors weighing on domestic growth, including drought conditions in parts of the country, fiscal consolidation, reduced dairy incomes, and the high exchange rate.On a trade-weighted basis, the New Zealand dollar remains unjustifiably high and unsustainable in terms of New Zealand’s long-term economic fundamentals. A substantial downward correction in the real exchange rate is needed to put New Zealand’s external accounts on a more sustainable footing.Annual CPI inflation is expected to fall to around zero in the March quarter and remain low over 2015, reflecting the high exchange rate, low global inflation, and the recent falls in petrol prices. Inflation expectations appear to have fallen recently, and we will be closely monitoring the impact of this trend on wage and price setting behaviour, especially in the non-traded sector.Monetary policy remains focused on ensuring inflation settles at 2 percent over the medium term. As the economy expands, inflation returns gradually towards the midpoint of the target range.Our central projection is consistent with a period of stability in the OCR. However, future interest rate adjustments, either up or down, will depend on the emerging flow of economic data.

(Reuters) - Growth in China's investment, retail sales and factory output all missed forecasts in January and February, leaving investors with little doubt that the economy is still losing steam and in need of further support measures.
The figures came a day after data showed deflationary pressures in the factory sector intensified in February, and is likely to reinforce expectations of more interest rate cuts and other policy loosening to avert a sharper slowdown in the world's second-biggest economy.
Industrial output grew 6.8 percent in the first two months of the year compared with the same period a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, the weakest expansion since late 2008.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 7.8 percent rise, down slightly from December.
""This is indicative of the new normal advocated by President Xi,"" said Chester Liaw, an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore.
""Double-digit industrial production levels will be a thing of the past. It is highly unlikely that retail sales will hold out for long above the 10 percent mark as well.""
Retail sales climbed 10.7 percent in the first two months, missing expectations for a 11.7 percent rise.
Fixed-asset investment, a crucial driver of the Chinese economy, rose 13.9 percent in January and February from a year ago, also under estimates for a 15 percent gain.
China combines its January and February data releases for investment, retail sales and factory output to minimize distortions from the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in January last year but occurred in February this year.
Sluggish factory activity reinforces expectations that China's economic growth will slow to a quarter-century low of around 7 percent this year from 7.4 percent in 2014, even with expected additional stimulus measures.
Power generation rose 1.9 percent in January and February from a year earlier, well below 3.2 percent seen in all of 2014, which was the slowest growth rate in 16 years.
The Chinese economy has had a rough ride in the last 15 months as a property downturn compounded slackening growth in foreign and domestic demand and persistent industrial overcapacity. A widening corruption crackdown also has weighed on everything from investment to retail sales.
Policymakers have cut interest rates twice since November, and in early February reduced the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves in a bid to spur lending.
But with consumer inflation hovering near the government's ""vigilance level"" of around 1 percent, analysts expect the central bank to lower reserve requirements and interest rates again to stoke growth, in what would be its biggest easing campaign since the depths of the global financial crisis.
The central bank has singled out the rise in real interest rates on the back of cooling inflation as a further drag on the economy, especially as many companies are struggling with heavy debt levels."

394,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2015 01:42PM ET</span>",U.S. wholesale inventories rise; labor market tightening,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories unexpectedly rose in January as sales recorded their biggest decline since 2009, lifting the number of months it would take to clear warehouses to its highest level in more than 5-1/2 years.
While that would normally suggest a wholesale inventory overhang that could weigh on economic growth as firms draw down rather than build stocks, economists were little worried and blamed the jump in the inventory-to-sales ratio on the plunge in crude oil prices.
""In the current situation, it is only an issue for the oil industry because of the collapse in price. There is far less evidence of anything being amiss among other U.S. industries,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research in New York.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories increased 0.3 percent in January after being unchanged in December. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. 
With sales falling 3.1 percent, the largest drop since March 2009, that means it would take 1.27 months to clear shelves - the most since July 2009. The inventory-to-sales ratio was at 1.22 months in December.
Brent crude  has lost more than half its value since mid-2014, weighing on wholesale petroleum inventories and sales. The inventory-to-sales ratio for wholesale petroleum in January was the highest in two years.
Economists had forecast wholesale inventories flat in January. With inventories instead rising,  Barclays  (LONDON:BARC) lifted its first-quarter growth forecast one percentage point to a 1.8 percent annualized pace. Forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers raised its estimate to a 1.7 percent pace from 1.5 percent.
Economic growth in recent months has been slowed by harsh winter weather as well as a now-settled labor dispute at West Coast ports and weak growth in China and Europe. 
JOBS MARKET TIGHTENING
But with the labor market tightening, the cool-off in growth is likely to be temporary.
In a separate report, the National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index gained 0.1 point to 98 last month, the third highest reading since early 2007.
The survey of 716 small business owners found 53 percent reported hiring or trying to hire, up 5 percentage points, but 47 percent reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill. Twenty-nine percent could not fill open positions, the highest level since April 2006. 
About 14 percent cited the shortage of skilled labor as their top problem, the highest since September 2007. 
""This is a clear signal that many small businesses are having a hard time finding qualified people for their job openings,"" said Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
""In addition, many small businesses may need to increase their wage and salary offerings. This is further evidence that some labor market tightening is happening."" 
A separate report from the Labor Department showed job openings increased to 5 million in January, the highest reading in 14 years, from 4.9 million in December. With January's report, the government revised the data back to 2010. 
More people voluntarily left their jobs in January, pushing the quit rate - widely regarded as a measure of labor market confidence - back to its post recession high of 2.0 percent.
""Job openings and labor market confidence remain robust and reinforce the outlook for further labor market improvement in the months ahead,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
Many economists believe that tightening labor market conditions could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June. They expect the central bank could signal its intention by dropping a pledge to be ""patient"" in its so-called forward guidance at the end of its March 17-18 meeting.
The Fed as kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.

Economic growth in recent months has been chilled by harsh winter weather as well as a now-settled labor dispute at West Coast ports and softer growth in Asia and Europe. 
First-quarter growth estimates for the U.S. economy are currently running below a 2 percent annualized pace.
The NFIB survey found a modest increase in the number of small businesses increasing inventories, a good omen for growth. Businesses were slightly downbeat on prospects for the next six months and the outlook for sales.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The pace of Chinese inflation unexpectedly picked up in February, but producer prices continued to slide, underscoring the intense pressure on profit margins at Chinese companies and adding urgency to policymakers' efforts to find new ways to support growth.
The producer price index (PPI) declined 4.8 percent in February, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday - the most negative reading posted since Oct 2009 - extending a long-running factory deflation cycle that began in 2012 to nearly three years.
Economists and policymakers worry that the risk of deflation is rising for the world's second-largest economy, as drag from a property market downturn and widespread factory overcapacity is compounded by an uncertain global outlook and soft commodity prices.
China's statistics bureau attributed the 1.4 percent rise in consumer prices to higher costs for vegetables and fruit, while the decline in PPI - which analysts had expected to come in at minus 4.3 percent - was blamed on sliding prices for global commodities, in particular energy, which have undermined profitability at China's industrial heavyweights.
""February's seasonal pick-up in food inflation will likely prove short-lived and we still expect inflation to fall back below 1 percent in coming months,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in Singapore. ""Nonetheless, today's inflation data suggest that downward pressure on broader prices has begun to ease.""
But some economists questioned the significance of the price rise, saying it was disappointing in the context of Lunar New Year, and noted there was no significant increase in the price of pork, which usually rises around the week-long festival.
Annual changes in China's consumer prices will remain positive in the foreseeable future, the Shanghai Securities News on Tuesday quoted vice central bank governor Yi Gang as saying, while economists note the structure of consumer inflation is changing, showing rising costs for services, clothing, healthcare and recreation instead of residential inflation, which slowed to 0.6 percent.
""We continue to expect inflation to remain relatively low and still see disinflationary pressures in the economy,"" wrote Nomura economists in a research note after the news.
""To offset headwinds to economic growth, we expect monetary policy to be loosened further.""
The question is how long it will take for easing measures to take effect. The issue is becoming more pressing because unemployment, which has remained comfortably low even in the face of a weakening economy, is seen as coming under further pressure, the social security minister said on Tuesday.
Indeed, some economists suspect that many jobs are artificial, with factory workers being put on half-pay or no pay, or migrated to low-end service sector jobs in tourism by local officials to avoid social unrest from layoffs and the negative career consequences of high unemployment rates in their jurisdictions.
Chinese leaders announced last week an economic growth target of around 7 percent for this year, below the 7.5 percent goal in 2014.
The consumer price index target was set at around 3 percent for this year. Annual consumer inflation was 2 percent in 2014, well below the government's target of 3.5 percent.
Chinese stock markets were down slightly after the news, dragged by financials, with the CSI300 index (CSI300) down 0.5 percent in morning trade. The yuan <CNY=CFXS> firmed slightly against the dollar to 6.2623.
Combined January and February industrial output, retail sales and investment data will be released on Wednesday. All are expected to show slowing growth. Loan and money supply data will also be released this week.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports fell by the largest amount in five months in January, dropping more than forecast and putting a slight damper on the outlook for Europe's largest economy, though economists said a weak euro and cheap oil would help in the months ahead.
Seasonally-adjusted exports decreased by 2.1 percent on the month after a sharp rise in December, data from the statistics office showed. They missed the Reuters consensus forecast for a 1.5 percent drop and undershot even the lowest estimate for a 2.0 percent decline.
The data for December was revised down to a 2.8 percent gain from a previously reported 3.4 percent increase.
""It's a breather for the export sector but it's not so much a sign of upcoming weakness of the economy,"" said ING economist Carsten Brzeski, adding that growth of up to 0.4 percent was still likely for January-March given strong retail sales, decent industrial output and robust construction activity.
Household spending was the main growth driver in 2014 alongside resurgent investment though foreign trade, which traditionally propelled the economy, did make a contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) after dragging on it in 2013.
The government expects the economy, which expanded by 1.6 percent last year, to grow by 1.5 percent in 2015 and Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has said this will be mainly fueled by consumer spending which is booming thanks to low unemployment, rising wages and weak inflation plus a dramatic oil price drop.
But Stefan Kipar, economist at BayernLB said the prospects for German shipments abroad were bright: ""The weak euro should boost exports. The low oil price is also supporting the economy in many of Germany's trading partners, which should ultimately benefit German exporters too.""
An unadjusted breakdown showed shipments to the euro zone dropped by 2.8 percent in January compared with a year ago while Germany sent 0.5 percent fewer goods to countries outside of the European Union. Exports to countries within the EU that do not use the euro were the only ones to post a gain.
Most recent data has painted a rosy picture of the economy, suggesting it could grow robustly in the first quarter, with business and consumer morale rising and unemployment falling, though a sharp drop in industrial orders did muddy the waters.
Monday's data showed imports slipped by 0.3 percent, missing the Reuters consensus forecast for a 0.5 percent gain.

The trade surplus for January narrowed to 19.7 billion euros from a revised 21.6 billion euros in December.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports picked up in the first two months of 2015, propelled by February's exceptionally strong performance that was inflated by the timing of Lunar New Year, while a slide in imports pointed to persistent weakness in the economy.
Data released by the General Administration of Customs on Sunday showed that China posted a record trade surplus of $60.6 billion last month.
Exports rose 15 percent during the January-February period from a year earlier, quickening from a 6.1 percent annual rise in the whole of 2014 as demand from major markets improved.
February exports jumped 48.3 percent from a year earlier, the strongest rise since May 2010 and comfortably beat market expectations of 14.2 percent, but customs office cautioned about reading too much into the figure given seasonal distortions.
It said local exporters usually make concentrated shipments ahead of the long Lunar New Year holiday. The new year fell on Feb. 19 this year, whereas in 2014 it occurred on Jan. 31.
January exports fell 3.3 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts tend to look at the combined trade data for the two months to help smooth out distortions caused by the holiday.
""We don't expect the sharp rise in February exports to be sustained as global demand could only recover steadily,"" said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
In February, exports to the United States - China's largest export market - jumped 48.5 percent from a year earlier but fell slightly from January, according to customs data.
Exports to the Europe Union - the second largest market - rose 44.1 percent year-on-year but was also down month-on-month.
IMPORTS SLIDE
China's imports tumbled 20.2 percent in the first two months from a year earlier, signalling stubborn weakness in the world's second-largest economy that may require more policy support, analysts say. Imports inched up 0.4 percent in 2014.
""The sharp decline in imports highlights slackening domestic demand, so we expect the government to take more policy measures to stabilise economic growth,"" Nie said.
A 20.5 percent slide in February imports was the sharpest since the global financial crisis.
Imports have been weaker than exports, highlighting the need to spur domestic demand amid fears of deflation, as some short-term investors pull out of the country - illustrated by sustained capital outflows in recent months.
Despite the solid trade surplus, a string of weak data has put some pressure on the yuan<cny=cfxs>against the dollar. But analysts say the yuan's modest fall versus the dollar may not help exporters much, given that it has risen against other currencies.
Indeed, a private manufacturing survey showed export orders shrank in February despite a slight pick up in factory activity.
The government has set an economic growth target of around 7 percent for this year, below the 7.5 percent goal that was narrowly missed in 2014, but analysts believe more policy support is needed to arrest the slowdown.
Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng said on Saturday that he was confident of meeting annual trade growth target of 6.1 percent in 2015.
China plans to run its biggest budget deficit in 2015 since the global financial crisis, stepping up spending as Premier Li Keqiang signalled that the lowest rate of growth in a quarter of a century is the ""new normal"" for the economy.


The central bank has cut interest rates twice since November, on top of a cut in bank reserve requirements in early February, amid concerns about deflationary risks as growth slows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers stepped up hiring in February and the jobless rate fell to its lowest level since the spring before President Barack Obama took office, which could put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in June.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 295,000 last month after rising 239,000 in January, the Labor Department said on Friday. The broad job gains came despite disruptive winter weather that took hold across large parts of the country in mid-February.
The unemployment rate dropped two-tenths of a percentage point to 5.5 percent, the lowest since May 2008, slipping into territory that some Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
""The labor market is on a roll. This should ease fears at the Fed that the global downturn and sharp drop in oil prices are materially disrupting the U.S. economic outlook, and keep the Fed firmly on course for a June lift-off,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.
U.S. stocks and shorter-dated government bonds fell sharply as traders brought forward bets on when the Fed would raise rates. The dollar hit an 11-1/2-year high against the euro, which has been under pressure since the European Central Bank announced a bond-buying program to lower euro zone borrowing costs.
Last month's decline in the unemployment rate, however, largely reflected people dropping out of the labor force.
But economists, who had expected payrolls to rise only 240,000 and the unemployment rate to fall to 5.6 percent, noted that other indicators monitored by the U.S. central bank showed a rapidly tightening labor market.
February marked the 12th straight month that employment gains have been above 200,000, the longest such run since 1994.
Average hourly earnings rose by three cents last month, leaving the year-on-year gain at 2 percent. That compared to a 2.2 percent rise seen in the 12 months through January.
While economists acknowledged that persistently sluggish wage growth and very benign inflation argued against the Fed pulling the trigger in June, they said tightening conditions in the labor market could force the central bank's hand.
A Reuters survey of 16 large banks conducted after the jobs report found that many economists expect a June rate hike.
""Even if the Fed decides to delay the lift-off in policy, it is hard to see the downward trend in unemployment not continuing,"" said Jeremy Lawson, chief economist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, Scotland.
""Will the Fed really want short-term interest rates to be negative when the unemployment rate falls below 5 percent late this year or early next year?""
WAGE VIGIL
Fed officials are monitoring pay data closely to help determine when enough pressure has built in the jobs market to merit higher borrowing costs to keep the economy from overheating.
The central bank has kept its key overnight lending rate near zero since December 2008.
Wage growth could get a lift from an announcement last month by Wal-Mart (N:WMT), the world's largest retailer, that it would spend more than $1 billion this year to increase wages for about 40 percent of its U.S. workforce.
Other companies including TJX Cos Inc (N:TJX) and health insurer Aetna (N:AET) also have announced pay increases.
The closely followed employment report was released a little more than a week before the Fed's March 17-18 policy meeting. Many economists expect the central bank could signal its openness to a June rate hike by dropping a pledge to be ""patient"" in considering such a move.
""It is most likely they will drop 'patience' in March,"" said Samuel Coffin, an economist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
February's sturdy jobs report reinforces the view that a recent cooling in economic growth reflects temporary factors, such as harsh winter weather and a now-settled labor dispute at West Coast ports.
That dispute weighed on exports and imports in January as the trade deficit narrowed by $3.8 billion to $41.8 billion, a separate report from the Commerce Department showed.
While the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.8 percent last month, other measures on the Fed's so-called dashboard improved.
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell to its lowest level since September 2008.
The number of Americans unemployed for 27 weeks or longer also dropped to a six-year low.
Overall, private payrolls increased 288,000 last month, with construction employment rising 29,000. Manufacturing payrolls were up 8,000 and government employment jumped 7,000.
There were hefty gains in retail payrolls, while employment in the leisure and hospitality sector recorded its largest increase since August 2012.

The mining sector saw an acceleration in job losses last month, with payrolls posting their biggest decline since August 2009. It was hurt by a loss of 1,100 jobs tied to oil and gas extraction, which has taken a hit from lower crude oil prices.

426,By International Business Times,"<span>Mar 06, 2015 09:31AM ET</span>","Economy Adds 295,000 Jobs In February, Jobless Rate Falls To 5.5%","By Dion Rabouin -

The U.S. added 295,00 jobs to the economy in February, outpacing analysts’ expectations of 240,000. That number brought the national unemployment rate to 5.5 percent from its 5.7 percent rate in January, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. BLS also noted that January job growth was revised down to 239,000 jobs added from the previously reported 257,000.
February’s unemployment rate of 5.5 percent, as well as the number of unemployed persons -- 8.7 million -- edged down for the month. So far for 2015, the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons are down by 1.2 percentage points and 1.7 million people, respectively, the report found.
February’s numbers marked the 12th straight month the economy has added more than 200,000 jobs, the longest such stretch since 1994.
The numbers also beat forecasts for the jobless rate, which was predicted to fall one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.6 percent, according to analysts interviewed by Reuters. Those numbers pushed higher despite cold and snow that blanketed much of the country in February. But the adverse conditions set in after the government surveyed employers, economists said.
The number of long-term unemployed, or individuals who have been without a job for 27 weeks or more, was little changed at 2.7 million in February. These individuals accounted for 31.1 percent of those unemployed, BLS reported, adding that over the past four quarters, the number of long-term unemployed has decreased by 1.1 million.
The civilian labor force participation rate was little changed at 62.8 percent in February and has remained within a narrow range of 62.7 to 62.9 percent since April 2014. The employment-population ratio was held at 59.3 percent in February but is up by half a percentage point over the year."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment aid last week rose to its highest level since May, but economists dismissed the increase as weather-related and said the jobs market remained solid.
They were also little perturbed by other data on Thursday that showed factory orders fell in January for a sixth straight month and fourth-quarter productivity declined by more than initially thought.
The reports, however, suggested some near-term weakness in economic growth.
""The underlying fundamentals of the economy remain solid and there is no reason we won't continue to see the type of economic growth and job growth that we saw in 2014 continuing this year,"" said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 320,000 for the week ended Feb. 28, the Labor Department said. It was the second consecutive week of increases.
While the Labor Department cited no special factors influencing the data, economists said cold and snowy weather in February and a strike by petroleum refinery workers were likely to blame.
Data for the week ended Feb. 21 showed a large number of layoffs in Kentucky because of bad weather.
""We suspect the pattern reflects the weather rather than fundamental deterioration. That said, we will, of course, be on watch for the possibility that the rise in the last two weeks marks a change in the trend,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 10,250 to 304,750 last week.
The claims data has no bearing on Friday's employment report for February as it falls outside the survey period.
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased 240,000 last month after rising by 257,000 in January, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast falling one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.6 percent.
The economy added more than a million jobs between November and January, a feat last seen in 1997.
U.S. stocks were trading higher on Thursday after the European Central Bank said it would start its new government bond-buying program of 60 billion euros a month on March 9 and raised its economic growth forecast for 2015.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were little changed, while the dollar rose to an 11-1/2-year high against the euro.
SOFT MANUFACTURING
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods slipped 0.2 percent in January after dropping 3.5 percent in December.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans – rose 0.5 percent instead of the 0.6 percent advance reported last month.
Manufacturing has been hurt by softening demand in Europe and Asia as well as a strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which have caused some energy companies to either delay or cut back on capital expenditure projects.
A labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which has since been resolved, also has weighed on factory activity through disruptions to the supply chain.
There is optimism the sector will regain momentum in the second quarter as some of these factors fade.
""There are some signs that the core capital goods data might be starting to turn the corner after a weak end to 2014,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
A second report from the Labor Department showed productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, fell at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter as the number of hours worked outpaced output. It was previously reported to have declined at a 1.8 percent pace.
Productivity has been weak for much of the recovery from the 2007-09 recession, helping to boost hiring.
""Of late, job growth has been extraordinary, but it now behooves employers to quickly utilize these new hires as effectively as those already on the job,"" said Doug Handler, chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
In the fourth quarter, hours worked increased at a revised 4.9 percent rate instead of the previously reported 5.1 percent pace. Compensation per hour rose at a 1.9 percent rate, rather than the 0.9 percent pace reported last month.

That left unit labor costs, a key gauge of inflation and profit pressures that measures the price of labor for any given unit of output, increasing at a 4.1 percent rate in the fourth quarter - up from the 2.7 percent rate reported last month.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending February 28 increased by 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 320,000 from the previous week’s total of 313,000.

Continuing jobless claims in the week ended February 21 rose to 2.421 million from 2.404 million in the preceding week. Analysts had expected continuing claims to decline to 2.400 million.
The four-week moving average was 304,750, an increase of 10,250 from the previous week’s total of 294,500. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

The survey's employment index jumped to 56.4 from 51.6, moving from its lowest level since February 2014 to its highest level since October.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2015 01:59PM ET</span>","U.S. private sector adds jobs in February, but growth slows: ADP","By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. private employers added fewer jobs than expected last month, with the gains declining as well from January's revised level as growth slowed in some sectors, a payrolls processor report showed on Wednesday.
The ADP National Employment Report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, showed a gain of 212,000 private-sector jobs. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP to show a gain of 220,000 jobs. 
January's private payrolls were also revised upward to 250,000 from the previously reported 213,000.
The report showed moderating employment gains in sectors such as manufacturing, goods producing, and services. For instance, service-providing employment rose by 181,000 jobs in February, compared with growth of 206,000 in the sector in January. 
The manufacturing sector added just 3,000 jobs in February, well below January's 15,000.
""Job growth is strong, but slowing from the torrid pace of recent months,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. ""Job gains remain broad-based, although the collapse in oil prices has begun to weigh on energy-related employment.""
The ADP figures come ahead of the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment.
Economists polled by Reuters are looking for total U.S. employment to have grown by 240,000 jobs in February, down from 257,000 in January. The unemployment rate, on the other hand, is expected to have ticked lower to 5.6 percent from January's 5.7 percent.
Overall, analysts said despite the slower jobs growth in February, the private-sector employment outlook remained bright and augured well for the non-farm payrolls report.
""The ADP report shows that payrolls continue to increase at a solid pace through February,"" said Daniel Silver, economist at JPMorgan in New York.

He added that the report also showed no significant adverse impact from winter weather, as growth in construction payrolls remained strong in February. The construction industry added 31,000 jobs, the same number as last month.

Financial data firm Markit said the final reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the services sector rose to 57.1 in February, its highest level since October. The reading was roughly even with the preliminary read of 57.0 but up from the 54.2 recorded in January.
A reading above 50 separates expansion from contraction.
The new business subindex jumped to 57.1 from January's read of 51.7, the index's lowest reading in the history of the Markit services sector series, which dates from October 2009. The final number was also up from the preliminary read of 56.7.
""Business picked up especially towards the end of the month, when the impact of bad weather on the East Coast and port delays on the West Coast began to clear, which suggests this may be a temporary upturn,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. 
Williamson said the current pace of expansion would not lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates ""anytime soon.""
""However, the ongoing resilience of the U.S. economy, and in particular the sustained robust job creation signaled in February, adds to the sense that policymakers will continue to prepare the ground for a rate rise later this year.""
The employment subindex rose from January but was down from February's preliminary reading.
Markit's composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, rose to 57.2 in February from 54.4 in January. The preliminary February read was 56.8.

U.S. new auto sales increased 5.3 percent in February, to 1.26 million units, compared to February 2014. Harsh winter weather had a stronger than expected impact on the nation’s dealerships, especially in the last week of the short sales month. Most forecasts had put sales growth at 8 percent, or 1.29 million units.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate – a running measure of deliveries over a 12 month period that gauges the health of the market – came in at 16.24 million instead of the 16.7 million units that were expected. But most industry watchers are pointing to bad weather as the cause. Consumer confidence hit an 11-year high in January and job growth is at its fastest pace in over 20 years; both are signals that auto sales will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than we’ve seen in recent years. “Heading into 2015, we expected to see continued but slowing growth in the U.S. auto sector, and two months into the year it appears as though we have no reason to alter our expectations,” Alec Gutierrez, senior analyst, Kelley Blue Book, said in an email.
If February’s disappointing sales numbers are weather related, we should see a stronger March performance. Most forecasts still see U.S. new car sales hitting 17 million in 2015, which would be the highest number since 2001’s 17.1 million.
The U.S. auto market has been in recovery mode since the industry bottomed out at a 30-year-low of 10.6 million sales in 2009. In 2014, Americans bought 16.8 million new vehicles, pushing annual sales to their highest level since 2005.
“The underlying fundamentals supporting growth in 2015 remain solid,” Yong Yang, Ford’s chief economist for the Americas, said in a conference call Tuesday after Ford’s numbers were released. “In spite of the recent rebound, fuel prices remain low and continue to provide a significant boost to consumer disposable income.”
Most automakers pulled back on cash incentive programs last month. FCA (formerly Chrysler Group), which reduced its incentive by 3.2 percent from the previous February, according to TrueCar. The industry incentive average was $2,623, 1.2 percent higher than January but 2.9 percent lower than February 2014. Incentive spending is a closely watched metric because it measure how much automakers are sacrificing in profit to attract sales."

DETROIT (Reuters) - For the second year in a row, ferocious winter weather slowed U.S. vehicle sales in February, causing the major automakers to miss analysts' bullish projections.
Six of the top seven manufacturers on Tuesday reported year-to-year sales increases in February, but all fell short of expectations.
""Mother Nature was just not nice to us,"" said Fred Diaz, U.S. chief for the Nissan brand. He expects the industry to recoup lost sales as the weather improves.
Total U.S. sales in February rose 5.3 percent to 1,257,619 vehicles, according to research firm Autodata. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected an increase of 7.1 percent. 
The industry finished with an annualized sales rate in February of 16.23 million vehicles, far below the 16.7 million that economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected.
Most companies blamed extreme weather conditions in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest, and some pointed to a spike in fuel prices toward the end of the month. 
""There was definitely a slowdown"" in sales after February 20,"" said Mark LaNeve,  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) U.S. sales vice president. LaNeve said Ford's fleet sales fell, while retail sales were flat.
John Krafcik, president of research firm TrueCar, said the extreme weather likely had a greater impact on sales of cars than trucks.
General Motors Co (N:GM) said U.S. February sales climbed 4 percent from a year ago to 231,378 cars and trucks, while Ford's sales dropped 2 percent to 180,383.  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) posted an increase of 6 percent to 163,586 vehicles.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said sales were up 13 percent to 180,467 cars and trucks. Nissan Motor Co's (T:7201) sales were up 3 percent to 118,436 vehicles, and Honda Motor Co (T:7267) reported an increase of 5 percent to 105,466. 
Tempering analysts' bullish expectations for car sales, U.S. consumer sentiment fell from an 11-year high in February, weighed down by the unusually severe winter, according to a monthly survey released on Friday by the University of Michigan.
Despite the weakening of sentiment, ""my clients aren't holding their hand over the panic button,"" said Mark Wakefield, managing director at AlixPartners.
The average vehicle transaction price in February fell slightly from a month ago to $33,299, according to industry researcher Kelley Blue Book, but the average price is still $1,145 higher than a year ago.
Average per-vehicle incentive spending by carmakers remained steady at $2,623, according to TrueCar.
Domestic luxury brands took a beating in February, with GM's Cadillac down 13 percent and Ford's Lincoln off 7 percent.
Continued low fuel prices dented sales of electrified vehicles, with the Chevrolet Volt hybrid sliding 43 percent, the Ford C-Max hybrid off 26 percent and the Nissan Leaf down 16 percent.
Sales of small cars and family sedans slid last month, while big trucks continued to show strength. GM's full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups were up 24 percent and 6 percent, respectively.

A similar performance is expected by most observers in 2015, with the US economy continuing to strengthen, even as China’s growth slows a little from last year’s outcome.Commodity prices have declined over the past year, in some cases sharply. The price of oil in particular has fallen significantly. These trends appear to reflect a combination of lower growth in demand and, more importantly, significant increases in supply. The much lower levels of energy prices will act to strengthen global output and temporarily to lower CPI inflation rates.Financial conditions are very accommodative globally, with long-term borrowing rates for several major sovereigns at all-time lows over recent months. Some risk spreads have widened a little but overall financing costs for creditworthy borrowers remain remarkably low.In Australia the available information suggests that growth is continuing at a below-trend pace, with domestic demand growth overall quite weak. As a result, the unemployment rate has gradually moved higher over the past year. The economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet. With growth in labour costs subdued, it appears likely that inflation will remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate.Credit is recording moderate growth overall, with stronger growth in lending to investors in housing assets. Dwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities over recent months. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have risen, in part as a result of declining long-term interest rates.The Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising US dollar, though less so against a basket of currencies. It remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy.At today’s meeting the Board judged that, having eased monetary policy at the previous meeting, it was appropriate to hold interest rates steady for the time being. Further easing of policy may be appropriate over the period ahead, in order to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation consistent with the target. The Board will further assess the case for such action at forthcoming meetings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell for a second straight month in January as households continued to cut back on purchases, opting to save much of the massive windfall from cheaper gasoline. 
Other data on Monday showed factory activity slowed in February and construction spending declined sharply in January, adding to signs that economic growth moderated early in the first quarter.
""Growth is slowing in the first quarter after a strong second half of last year. All the gas savings are ending up at the bank rather than being spent,"" Thomas Costerg, an economist at  Standard Chartered  (LONDON:STAN) Bank in New York. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slipped 0.2 percent after falling 0.3 percent in December. The January dip reflected lower gasoline prices, which weighed on sales receipts at service stations, as well as drop in purchases of big-ticket items.
With lower gasoline prices dampening inflation pressures, the so-called real consumer spending increased 0.3 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in December. 
But economists said the rise in the measure, which goes into the calculation of gross domestic product, was disappointing.
That and another report from the Commerce Department showing a 1.1 percent drop in construction spending in January prompted some economists to cut their first-quarter growth estimates.
""It (consumer spending report) raises a yellow flag regarding the pace of consumption in the first quarter and by extension the pace of growth,"" Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cut its first-quarter growth estimate by five-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.3 percent annual pace, while forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers lowered their forecast to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent. 
Housing data for January released last month was also weak.
The economy grew 3.6 percent in the second half of 2014, with consumer spending accounting for the bulk of the gain.
As inflation pressures weakened further, a price index for consumer spending rose only 0.2 percent in the 12 months through January, the softest reading since October 2009. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index had increased 0.8 percent in December. 
Excluding food and energy, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.3 percent in the 12 months through January. The Federal Reserve has a 2 percent inflation target.
FED SEEN PAT
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said last week the central bank's policy-setting committee ""needs to be reasonably confident that over the medium-term inflation will move up toward its 2 percent objective"" before it starts to raise interest rates.
U.S. stocks were trading higher, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. [MKTS/GLOB]
""The latest inflation report offers no reason to assume inflation has stabilized, let alone is reversing course back toward the committee's longer-term target,"" said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee in Chicago. ""Continued pressure on prices will further delay Fed action.""
Households are using much of the savings from cheaper gasoline to pay down debt and build savings. 
Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation advanced 0.9 percent in January, the largest gain since December 2012. The saving rate increased to 5.5 percent, the highest in two years.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 52.9 in February, the weakest in 13 months, from 53.5 in January. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector.
From food to machinery and computers and electronic products, manufacturers blamed the labor dispute at the West Coast ports for a slowdown in activity. The dispute, which has since been resolved, caused a massive backlog. 
""We know that dispute got a lot worse in January, with both incoming and outgoing container shipments falling by roughly a quarter from December levels. It will take several months for the backlog to be cleared,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
Manufacturers in the petroleum and coal products fields complained that lower energy prices were pressuring revenues. Factory activity has also been hurt by weaker growth in Asia and Europe and a strong dollar. 

Reports on Monday showed factories in China remained in contraction territory in January, while those in the euro zone grew only modestly.

Chinese policymakers are embarking on their biggest easing campaign since the depths of the global crisis as the world's second-largest economy is weighed down by a cooling property market, high debt levels and excess factory capacity.
The People's Bank of China cut interest rates on Saturday, in the latest effort to support the economy as its momentum slows. The move was its third major policy easing since late November and came just days before the annual meeting of the country's parliament.
On Monday, a survey showed the HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) climbed to 50.7 in February - the strongest level since July - from 49.7 in January, as overall new orders picked up.
The number was stronger than a preliminary reading of 50.1, which was just above the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from a contraction on a monthly basis.
But even as factory activity picked up slightly, the survey showed manufacturers struggled to cope with erratic export demand and deflationary pressures.
The new export orders sub-index dipped to 48.5 in February, the sharpest contraction in a year, while both input and output prices fell for a seventh month. Manufacturing employment shrank for a 16th month, although the pace of job shedding moderated.
""China's manufacturing sector saw an improvement in overall operating conditions in February, with companies registering the strongest expansion of output since last summer while total new business also rose at a faster rate,"" said Annabel Fiddes, an economist at Markit.
""However, the renewed fall in new export orders suggests that foreign demand has weakened, while manufacturers continued to cut their staff numbers (albeit fractionally).""
An official survey released on Sunday showed China's factory sector contracted for a second straight month in February on unsteady exports and slowing investment, reinforcing bets that more policy loosening is needed.
The official survey looks more at larger, state-owned firms, while the HSBC/Market survey focuses on smaller firms.
MORE POLICY EASING
""We cannot see any signs of stabilization in the economy. We expect more policy easing via interest rate and reserve requirement cuts,"" said Zhou Hao, an economist at ANZ.
Chinese authorities will lean on interest rate and reserve requirement cuts and tolerate some currency weakness to ensure the economy grows around 7 percent this year, as they try to head off deflation and keep employment strong enough to push on with reforms, policy insiders have said.
The economy grew 7.4 percent in 2014, its slowest expansion in 24 years. Growth may slow 7 percent in the first quarter - widely seen as the minimum level for keeping employment steady - from 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter, a top government think tank said in a research report.
China's reform-minded leaders have shown greater tolerance for slower growth, but will have to avoid a sharper slowdown that could fuel job losses and debt default risks, analysts say.
China's yuan <CNY=CFXS> fell to its weakest level since October 2012 against the dollar on Monday after the rate cut.
The PBOC unexpectedly cut interest rates in November - for the first time since 2012 - and then followed up with a cut to banks' required reserve ratio in early February.
Despite the raft of stimulus moves, a newspaper owned by the central bank warned on Wednesday that China is dangerously close to slipping into deflation, highlighting the nervousness among policymakers about the sputtering economy.

Annual consumer inflation hit a five-year low in January while factory deflation worsened. Export and import growth had also tanked in the same month, performing worse than expected.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up to 49.9 in February from January's 49.8, a whisker below the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a weaker reading of 49.7.
A separate official services PMI, also released on Sunday, showed growth in the sector accelerated to 53.9, up from 53.7 in January.
Accounting for 48 percent of China's $10.2 trillion economy last year, the services sector has weathered the growth downturn better than factories, partly because it depends less on foreign demand.
The official PMIs were released shortly after China's central bank cut interest rates late on Saturday, the latest effort to support the world's second-largest economy as its momentum slows and deflation risks rise.
LEGISLATURE TO CONVENE
The PMIs are the last official Chinese data to come out before the opening this week of the annual session of China's legislature, where leaders will announce a growth target for 2015.
The final February reading for the HSBC manufacturing PMI survey will be announced on Monday. The flash estimate showed factory growth edged up to a four-month high in February, but export orders shrank at their fastest rate in 20 months.
To boost a sagging economy, China's central bank lowered the reserve requirement - the ratio of cash that banks must set aside as reserves - in February for the first time in over two years.
That was after it had cut interest rates in November, also for the first time in more than two years.
Despite the raft of stimulus moves, a newspaper owned by the central bank warned on Wednesday that China is dangerously close to slipping into deflation, highlighting the nervousness among policymakers about a sputtering economy that is not gaining speed.
A housing slump, erratic growth in exports and a state-led slowdown in investment to help restructure China's economy dragged growth to 7.4 percent last year - a level not seen since 1990.

Reflecting China's ""new normal"" of slower but better-quality growth, economists at state think-tanks with knowledge of policy discussions said the government is likely to lower its 2015 economic growth target to around 7 percent, from last year's 7.5 percent.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2015 04:49PM ET</span>","China cuts rates again in face of weak demand, deflation risk","By Megha Rajagopalan and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's central bank cut interest rates on Saturday, just days before the annual meeting of the country's parliament, in the latest effort to support the world's second-largest economy as its momentum slows and deflation risks rise.
The central bank said the 25 basis point cut in the benchmark interest rate to 5.35 percent - its second cut in just over three months - and a 25 basis point cut in the benchmark saving rate to 2.5 percent would be effective from Sunday.
""The focus of the interest rate cut is to keep real interest rate levels suitable for fundamental trends in economic growth, prices and employment,"" the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement on its website.
""This does not represent a change in the direction of monetary policy.""
However, using new language to describe the policy setting, the PBOC said the latest rate cut would create a ""neutral and appropriate"" monetary environment for China.
The move came four weeks after the bank had lowered the level of cash banks must set aside as reserves, known as the reserve requirement ratio or RRR, leading some to believe the PBOC was growing increasingly worried about deflationary risk.
The reference to ""real interest rates"" in Saturday's statement also implied that sliding prices were an important factor in its decision.
An article in the central bank's official newspaper on Feb. 25 had warned that deflationary risks were higher than many thought.
""The rate cut happened in the first week after the Lunar New Year holiday, underscoring the government's hope to boost corporate confidence,"" said Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.
""Deflation is the top enemy. Only through continuous easing (rate and RRR cuts), we can ease the vicious cycle of economic contraction.""
Globally around 20 central banks have eased policy this year to counter deflationary pressures driven in part by the plunge in oil prices.
REDUCING REAL RATES
In its last round of rate cuts in November, the PBOC reduced one-year benchmark lending rates by 40 basis points to 5.6 percent and lowered one-year benchmark deposit rates by 25 basis points to 2.75 percent.
Beijing has been trying to stimulate investment to reinvigorate an economy that expanded at its slowest rate for 24 years in 2014, but it is questionable whether the cuts alone will be able to revive appetite for productive investment.
That might not be the primary goal of this cut, said Andrew Polk, economist at the Conference Board in Beijing. He and other economists pointed out that many Chinese companies are carrying staggering debt burdens, so allowing them to refinance at lower rates is seen as a way to put more cash in their pockets.
""I think most of the loan demand is still pretty weak, so what this does is (to) lower primarily the cost of financing for people who can borrow at the benchmark; the big state borrowers and local governments, those heavily indebted entities,"" Polk said. ""But it's not likely to spur private sector borrowing.""
The surprise interest rate cut in November, followed up by a February reduction in the RRR that poured fresh cash into the financial system, had little apparent effect on business confidence, although the liquidity was welcomed by the stock market.
China's annual consumer inflation hit a five-year low in January while factory deflation worsened, underscoring deepening weakness in the economy. Export and import growth had also tanked in the same month, performing worse than expected.
Although January and February data is considered unreliable due to the week-long lunar new year festival holiday, most economists predicted the central bank would have to follow up with further cuts to guidance lending rates and the RRR this year if it wanted to gain policy traction.
Deflationary cycles, once entrenched, can stall investment for years or even decades, as the case of Japan highlights, and is considered a nightmare scenario by many economists in China.
""The economy is unlikely to stabilise immediately after the rate cut,"" wrote Minsheng Securities economists in a research note reacting to the news.
""Expectations of loose monetary policy and renminbi depreciation will persist.""
China is due to release official factory and services Purchasing Managers' Index surveys for February on Sunday, the last data release before the National People's Congress, the rubber-stamp legislature, convenes next week."
542,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2015 01:26AM ET</span>","U.S. economy slowed in fourth quarter, but growth outlook still favorable","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth braked more sharply than initially thought in the fourth quarter amid a moderate increase in business inventories and a wider trade deficit, but strong domestic demand brightened the outlook.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.2 percent annual pace, revised down from the 2.6 percent pace estimated last month, the Commerce Department said on Friday. The economy grew at a 5 percent rate in the third quarter.
Growth is poised to pick up in the first quarter now that the threat of an inventory overhang has diminished. However, an exceptionally cold and snowy February, as well as reductions in oil and gas drilling, could limit the pace of expansion.
""The composition of growth is looking much better, we are setting up for a solid quarter for the economy. The first quarter is still work in progress,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Businesses accumulated $88.4 billion worth of inventory in the fourth quarter, far less than the $113.1 billion the government had estimated last month.
That resulted in the GDP growth contribution from inventories being cut to one-tenth of a percentage point from 0.8 percentage point previously.
The moderate stock accumulation came as consumer spending grew at its quickest pace since early 2006.
With households bullish about the economy's prospects, thanks to a tightening labor market and lower gasoline prices, consumer spending is likely to remain at lofty levels this year.
A second report showed the University of Michigan's final February reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment was 95.4, higher than the initial reading of 93.6.
While that was a retreat from January's reading of 98.1, it was the second highest level since January 2007.
""A more confident consumer is likely to spend more on big ticket items and other discretionary items, and looking ahead, we expect consumer spending ... to outpace 2014,"" said Kristin Reynolds, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
First-quarter growth estimates currently range between a rate of 2.4 percent and 3 percent.
U.S. stocks were little changed, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies.
ROBUST CONSUMER SPENDING
Growth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 4.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, still the fastest since the first quarter of 2006.
In another positive for the economy, business investment was not as weak as previously reported, with spending on equipment revised to show it rising at a 0.9 percent rate instead of the previously reported 1.9 percent contraction.
Growth in spending on intellectual products was the strongest since early 2000. All signs point to an acceleration in business investment in the first quarter, with data on Thursday showing a rebound in spending intentions in January after four straight months of declines.
But lower oil prices have caused a drop in drilling and exploration activity. The impact is yet to be felt in the data.
Another report on Friday showed factory activity in the Midwest in February plunged to its lowest level since July 2009.
Activity was likely dampened by bad weather and a long-running labor dispute at West Coast ports, which has since been resolved.
The Commerce Department data showed a key measure of domestic demand was revised to a 3.2 percent pace for the fourth quarter from the previous 2.8 percent rate. It was the third straight quarter of growth above a 3 percent rate.
Strong domestic demand sucked in more imports than previously reported in the fourth quarter, resulting in a trade deficit, which subtracted 1.15 percentage points from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 1.02 percentage point drag.
Despite the strong consumption, inflation pressures were muted, with the personal consumption expenditures price index falling at a 0.4 percent rate - the weakest reading since early 2009. The PCE index was previously reported to have declined at a 0.5 percent pace.
Excluding food and energy, prices rose at an unrevised 1.1 percent pace, the slowest since the second quarter of 2013.
The low inflation environment suggests little urgency for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates from near zero, where they have been since December 2008.
Residential construction spending in the fourth quarter was revised down, while government spending was not as weak as previously reported.

Strong job gains are expected to lift housing this year. A third report on Friday from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase previously owned homes rose 1.7 percent in January to their highest level in 1-1/2 years.

The University of Michigan's final February reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment was 95.4, sliding from January's 98.1, which was the highest since January 2004.
February's final number, however, was higher than the initial estimate of 93.6 released in the middle of the month, and was stronger than the market forecast of 94.0.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 106.9 from 109.3 in January, but beat a forecast of 103.
The report's gauge of consumer expectations also slipped to 88 from 91, but was roughly in line with forecasts for this metric.
""It is hard not to attribute the small February decline to the temporary impact of the harsh weather, as declines that occurred in the Northeast and Midwest were triple the average loss, while Southern residents grew more optimistic,"" the report said.

Data also indicated that personal consumption expenditures will grow 3.3 percent this year.

The National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index rose 1.7 percent last month, a gain that more than reversed a December slide.
In addition, the drop in December was much less severe than previously thought, with pending sales declining just 1.5 percent as opposed to the previously reported 3.7 percent drop.
The increase last month took contract signings, which usually turn into sales after a month or two, to their highest level since August 2013.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese households cut spending more than expected and retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in January, data showed on Friday, a sign the central bank's radical stimulus has yet to convince consumers that inflation will take hold.
In contrast to the gloom felt among households, companies looked to be in better shape as they begin to benefit from the competitive advantage their goods get from a weak yen.
Factory output jumped at the fastest pace in nearly four years in January as companies ramped up spending at home and won more orders in emerging markets, suggesting that exports will keep the economy on track for a moderate recovery.
But the soft consumption readings underscore the unevenness of the recovery and pose a headache for the Bank of Japan, which hopes its aggressive money printing will drive up inflation expectations and prompt households to spend more.
""If consumer spending doesn't pick up by April, it will be difficult for industrial production to accelerate,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Securities.
Separate data underscored the dilemma the central bank faces with inflation almost grinding to a halt on slumping oil prices, moving further away from the BOJ's ambitious target of reaching 2 percent around the next fiscal year beginning in April.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda defended his two-year timeframe for achieving the target on Friday, warning that adopting a relaxed approach to the deadline would undermine efforts to defeat deflation.
But analysts are deeply skeptical of whether the BOJ can meet its goal, as they expect it to take at least six months for the benefits of lower oil prices to boost growth, assuming consumers will spend the money they save on their fuel bills.
WEAK AT HOME, STRONG ABROAD
The weak consumer mood has kept a lid on spending as wages have yet to increase enough to make up for the sales tax hike last April, casting doubt on the strength of the recovery.
Household spending fell a more-than-expected annual 5.1 percent in January in the 10th straight month of declines, the longest losing streak since the global financial crisis in 2009. Annual retail sales dropped a worse-than-expected 2.0 percent.
In a glimmer of hope, factory output jumped 4.0 percent in January, exceeding a 2.7 percent gain expected by economists and the biggest increase since 2011.
""Output is showing signs of an export-led recovery"" as solid U.S. demand acts as a driver of global growth, said Hiroshi Watanabe, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""This virtuous cycle of factory activity will continue to underpin Japanese output and capital spending ahead.""
Solid U.S. growth is encouraging exporters of electronics and cars, such as Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), which is trying to boost shipments from Japan to benefit from the weaker yen.
""I can't (give) you concrete numbers now but we have already started to work on how we can capitalize on the available capacity in Japan for North America,"" said Jose Munoz, executive vice president at Nissan and chairman of its North American arm.
For the whole Japanese auto industry, however, sales are steadily falling due partly to April's sales tax hike.
Manufacturers surveyed by the ministry expect output to rise only slightly in February and fall 3.2 percent in March, as overseas orders for machinery and electronic parts peak from current very high levels, a ministry official told reporters.
The mixed data will keep the BOJ under pressure to maintain its stimulus, although Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stressed he saw no need to ease policy again soon.

Stripping away the effect of last year's tax hike, the core consumer price index - which excludes volatile food but includes oil costs - rose just 0.2 percent in January year-on-year, less than expected and slowing from 0.5 percent in December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices fell over the past year for the first time since 2009 as gasoline prices continued to tumble, which could allow a cautious Federal Reserve more room to hold off on raising interest rates.
Other data on Thursday showed a rebound in business investment spending plans and a steadily firming labor market, suggesting the move into deflation territory would be brief. In addition, gasoline prices have been rising in recent weeks.
""We believe the Fed will wait until September before achieving liftoff on interest rates and, even then, the process of normalization will move at a glacial pace,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index fell 0.1 percent in the 12 months through January, the first decline since October 2009 and a sharp deceleration from December's 0.8 percent rise. 
The CPI dropped 0.7 percent from December, the largest fall in six years, after slipping 0.3 percent in the prior month.
The dollar was unfazed by the weak inflation backdrop, rising more than one percent against a basket of currencies, while poor demand at a monthly note auction undercut prices for U.S. Treasuries. Stocks on Wall Street fell. 
Fed officials, who have long viewed the energy-driven drop in inflation as transitory, could take comfort from a rise in underlying price pressures last month. 
The U.S. central bank has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks a price measure that is running even lower than the CPI.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers this week that the central bank's policy-setting committee ""needs to be reasonably confident that over the medium-term inflation will move up toward its 2-percent objective"" before it starts to raise interest rates.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent last month after December's 0.1 percent gain. Economists, however, believe the effects of lower energy prices and a strong dollar still have to work their way through to the core CPI, which could mean tame readings ahead.
""It will be some time before the Fed gets the necessary confirmation that inflation will move back to target in the medium term,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The core CPI was lifted by increases in the cost of shelter, recreation and apparel prices. In the 12 months through January, the core CPI rose 1.6 percent after a similar gain in December.
OIL GLUT
Softer global demand and increased shale oil production in the United States have caused an oil glut, causing crude prices to plummet. 
Domestic gasoline prices plunged 18.7 percent in January, the biggest drop since December 2008, after falling 9.2 percent in the prior month. Gasoline prices have now declined for seven straight months.
Separately, the Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending intentions, increased 0.6 percent last month after a revised 0.7 percent fall in December. 
The increase followed four straight months of decline.
""Companies are laying in supplies to meet the demand from consumers down the road, so this is a positive for the outlook,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
""The economy looks on solid footing to start the year, with orders picking up and yes, there is some inflation out there.""
Business investment has been hurt by a softening global economy, as well as the strong dollar, which has dented the overseas profits of some companies. Lower crude oil prices are also undercutting demand for equipment in the oil field.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, fell 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in December.
Business spending was a drag on growth in the fourth quarter, holding the economy to a 2.6 percent annualized growth pace. First-quarter growth is currently forecast at around a 2.3 percent rate.
Another report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 313,000 in the week ended Feb. 21. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 11,500 to 294,500 last week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. single-family home sales fell only slightly in January despite big declines in the snow-battered Northeast while supply rose to its highest level since 2010, hopeful signs for a sluggish housing market.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales dipped 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 481,000 units. December's sales pace was revised up to 482,000 units, the highest level since June 2008, from 481,000 units.
""We are still taking sort of a meandering, bumpy path towards recovery. We expect housing will improve later this year due to the improvement in the labor market and credit conditions,"" said Stephanie Karol, a U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
Sales were likely held back by snow storms in the Northeast, where sales recorded their biggest drop since June 2012. 
Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 9.1 percent of the housing market, falling to a 470,000-unit pace last month. Compared to January of 2014, sales were up 5.3 percent.
The housing index (HGX) rose marginally, outperforming a broadly flat U.S. stock market. Shares in Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW), the No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain, fell 0.64 percent despite reporting same-store sales well above analysts' estimates.
Increased spending on home renovations also helped larger rival Home Depot (N:HD) post better-than-expected sales and profit on Tuesday. 
Housing activity has remained lackluster since hitting a speed bump in the second half of 2013, as tight home inventories and higher prices sideline first-time buyers and tepid wage growth also constrains buying. 
The housing sector has lagged the overall economy, even though mortgage rates have declined substantially from their 2013 peak. Recent data showed a plunge in home resales in January and softer single-family housing starts and permits. 
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday that housing had not ""recovered in the way that I would have anticipated.""
GROWING OPTIMISM 
In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said its measure of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, increased 4.6 percent last week, rising for the first time in six weeks.
There is more reason to be optimistic on housing. The labor market is gaining steam and housing activity should be boosted as more people get a paycheck. 
In addition, home prices are showing signs of reaccelerating after slowing for much of 2014. That should lift more homeowners out of ""underwater mortgages,"" giving them more equity in their properties and allowing some to put their houses on the market.
""Housing sales may be going nowhere, but with prices rising it looks like the deceleration in prices that had occurred for most of 2014 is largely over,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania.
""That is important as the sector is suffering from a shortage of inventory, which may be due, at least in part, to a lack of equity. The better the price gains, the more homes that can be brought to market.""    
Last month, new home sales in the Northeast plunged 51.6 percent to a record low. Sales in the South rose 2.2 percent to their highest level since May 2008, and surged 19.2 percent in the Midwest. Sales in the West, however, slipped 0.8 percent.
The stock of new houses available on the market rose 1.4 percent last month to 218,000, the highest level since March 2010. Inventories still remain at less than half of what they were at the height of the housing boom.
At January's sales pace it would take 5.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, unchanged from December.

The median new home price rose 9.1 percent from a year ago to $294,300, confirming an accelerating trend evident in recent house price data.

(Reuters) - Activity in China's mammoth factory sector edged up to a four-month high in February but export orders shrank at their fastest rate in 20 months, a private survey showed, painting a murky outlook that argues for more policy support.
The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched up to 50.1 in February, a whisker above the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from a contraction on a monthly basis.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 49.5, little changed from January's final PMI of 49.7.
But even as factory activity grew marginally, the survey suggested that manufacturers still faced considerable risks from weak foreign demand and deepening deflationary pressures.
While domestic demand picked up slightly, the new export orders sub-index shed three hefty points from January to skid to 47.1, the sharpest rate of contraction since June 2013.
""Domestic economic activity is likely to remain sluggish and external demand looks uncertain,"" said Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief economist in China. ""We believe more policy easing is still warranted at the current stage to support growth.""
Input and output prices also fell. Though prices did not drop as sharply as they did in January, the trend pointed to further pressure on companies' profitability.
Employment in factories shrank as well for the 16th straight month as firms dismissed workers to adjust to slower business.
The Australian dollar and emerging Asian currencies extended early gains after the PMI report, though shares in China and Hong Kong remained slightly lower.
Although the PMI is supposed to be adjusted for seasonal fluctuations in activity, including over the long Lunar New Year holiday when thousands of factories are shut, many analysts believe they have to wait until March for reliable data.
Weighed down by a cooling property market, industrial overcapacity and slowing investment, China's economy grew 7.4 percent in 2014, its slowest expansion in 24 years.
Economists expect growth to cool further to 7 percent in 2015, even with additional stimulus measures.
To lift flagging growth, the central bank reduced the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves earlier in February for the first time in over two years. In November, it cut interest rates, also for the first time in over two years.
Most analysts believe policy will be loosened further in coming months in the form of more rate cuts and reserve ratio reductions. This is especially after data earlier this month showed growth in China's broad M2 money supply slumped to its lowest on record in January.
Some economists said the plunge in M2 growth was a sign that more capital was leaving the world's second-largest economy as it cools, a trend that would tighten liquidity conditions and spur the central bank to ease policy.
Lu Lei, the head of the research bureau at the central bank, said this month that the country's monetary policy will be adjusted to keep liquidity at a reasonable level."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing is set to gain steam this year as a strengthening jobs market offsets the drag from an expected increase in mortgage rates, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. 
Housing activity has been sluggish since hitting a speed bump in the second half of 2013, with sales constrained by tight inventories and higher prices sidelining first-time buyers. 
""We expect the housing market to improve this year. It is only a matter of time until the improved jobs market has a positive effect on the housing market. We are betting that first-time buyers return this year,"" said David Nice, an economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
The survey forecast the S&P/Case Shiller composite index of prices in 20 metropolitan areas rising at an average of 4.0 percent this year and next. 
In November, the index had been forecast increasing at an average of 3.6 percent in 2015 and 3.1 percent next year. 
Home sales, however, will likely remain sluggish early in the year before picking up in the second quarter and maintaining a brisk pace for the rest of the year.
Sales of previously owned homes were forecast at an average annual rate of 5.10 million units in the first quarter, rising to 5.17 million units in the second quarter.
That was below the 5.20 million-unit rate for the first quarter and 5.26 million units for the April-June period that economists had forecast in the November survey. 
Data on Monday showed existing home sales tumbled to a nine-month low in January.
The survey forecast home resales averaging a 5.20 million-unit rate in the third quarter, with robust job gains expected to translate into sturdy wage gains. 
Wages have lagged increases in house prices, keeping first-time buyers on the sidelines. 
MODERATE RATE INCREASE
The economy has added more than a million jobs over the past three months, a performance last witnessed in 1997. A key gauge of labor market slack - the number of job seekers for every open position - hit its lowest level since 2007 in December.
Tightening labor market conditions are expected to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates later this year, which will push up mortgage rates. 
The increase in mortgage rates, however, is likely to be less steep than previously anticipated.
The survey forecast the 30-year mortgage rate averaging 4.00 percent this year and rising to an average of 4.58 percent in 2016. That compares to an average of 4.55 percent and 5.20 percent respectively in the November poll.
The 30-year mortgage rate is currently at 3.76 percent.
Also boding well for housing, the government has taken steps to make credit more accessible to first-time buyers, many of whom are saddled with huge college debts. 
A jump in the rate at which Americans are setting up home in the fourth quarter is also a good omen for housing. Strong household formation should encourage builders to break ground on new projects and help to improve housing inventory. 
""The overall picture is looking brighter as increased household formation is supported by improvements in the labor market,"" said Stephanie Karol, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. 
Relatively high house prices will lift more homeowners back above water and increase equity in the property.
""Soon, there the improvement in equity positions will be large enough that owners who couldn't sell but wanted to will be able to list their units. That would increase supply and make house shopping easier,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

In prepared remarks released before her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Fed Chair Yellen said that the central bank will change its forward guidance in an effort to increase the Fed's flexibility and mute any potential market reaction before beginning to hike rates.
According to Yellen, the central bank will first drop the word ""patient"" from its statement. However, that does not mean that a rate hike will automatically follow in a couple of meetings.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2015 12:50PM ET</span>","U.S. existing home sales at nine-month low, supply limited","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales fell sharply to their lowest level in nine months in January amid a shortage of properties on the market, a setback that could temper expectations for an acceleration in housing activity this year. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales declined 4.9 percent to an annual rate of 4.82 million units, the lowest level since last April.
""Existing home sales are taking a bumpy road towards recovery,"" said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.
The decline in sales, which was across all four regions, came despite the 30-year mortgage rate falling to a 20-month low. It was worse than economists' expectations for a 4.97 million unit-pace. 
Tight inventories are hurting sales by limiting the selection of houses available to potential buyers. The lack of supply is also keeping house prices elevated, helping to sideline first-time buyers from the market.
There is hope a tightening labor market would spur sturdy wage growth and pull first-time buyers into the market. But unless there is a significant pickup in the number of homes available for sale, the housing recovery could remain sluggish.
Housing has so far lagged the overall economic recovery. Home sales were up 3.2 percent from a year ago.
""With labor market activity still buoyant ... we expect the housing recovery to regain some positive momentum in the coming months,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The weak report and expectations of a dovish testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday lifted prices for U.S. Treasury debt. The U.S. central bank has consistently described the housing recovery as ""remaining slow.""
Minutes of the Fed's Jan. 27-28 meeting suggested policymakers were in no rush to start raising interest rates. Yellen will appear before lawmakers on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. The U.S. housing index (HGX) slipped as shares in largest homebuilder DR Horton (N:DHI) fell 0.8 percent. Lennar Corp (N:LEN) dropped 1.1 percent, while Pulte Group (N:PHM) slipped 0.9 percent. 
Last month, the inventory of unsold homes on the market slipped 0.5 percent from a year ago to 1.87 million. It was the second straight year-on-year decline. According to the Realtors group, supply should be rising by at least 10 percent.
Realtors and economists say insufficient equity and uncertainty about the economy's strength were forcing potential sellers to stay in their homes. A survey by the NAR showed homeowners on average staying in their homes for 10 years instead of the typical seven years.
At January's sales pace, it would take 4.7 months to clear houses from the market, down 2.1 percent from a year-ago. A six months' supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
There is little hope that supply will increase in the near-term. Data last week showed groundbreaking for single-family home projects fell sharply in January. Permits for future single-family home building also declined.
With supply shrinking, the median price for a previously owned home rose 6.2 percent in January from a year ago. The pace, which had been slowing after double-digit growth for much of 2013, appears to be reaccelerating.
Last month, the share of first-time buyers fell to 28 percent, the lowest since last June, from 29 percent in December. It was the second straight month of decline. Economists and real estate agents say a share of 40 percent to 45 percent is required for a strong housing recovery.
""Elevated home prices are only adding to barriers keeping first-time homebuyers and young adults from entering the housing market as prices are increasing faster than wages,"" said Sophia Kearney-Lederman, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.

Financial data firm Markit said its preliminary or ""flash"" U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 54.3 in February, up from the January's final reading of 53.9. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 53.6 reading.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity.
This month's output subindex rose to 56 from January's 55.7 final reading, its second straight monthly increase and best reading since October, while the employment subindex dipped to 51.7 from last month's 53.4. It was the slowest rate of factory employment growth since July, according to the report. 
Input prices contracted for a second consecutive month.
""Factory output growth ticked higher for a second successive month in February, suggesting the goods-producing sector is on course to make a robust contribution to the economy in the first quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, in a statement. 
""However, the rate of growth remains well down on last year's peaks, and a slowing of new orders growth to the weakest for just over a year looks to have caused employers to take a more cautious approach to hiring. Worries over Russia and the eurozone also continue to dampen risk appetite.""

Markit's ""flash"" reading is based on replies from about 85 percent of the U.S. manufacturers surveyed.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2015 11:59AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims fall as labor market gains momentum ,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, offering fresh evidence that the labor market was gathering steam.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 283,000 for the week ended Feb. 14, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
""The jobs market has its pedal to the metal. We have crossed the dividing line where there are more signs of labor shortages now than there is an excess supply of discouraged workers pounding the pavement,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Economists had forecast jobless claims falling to 293,000 last week. 
The labor market also got a boost from Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT), the largest private sector employer in the United States, which said it would spend more than $1 billion this year to increase pay for about 40 percent of its U.S. workforce.
The retailer's hourly full-time and part-time workers will earn at least $9 an hour, or $1.75 above the current federal minimum wage, starting in April. 
Prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries traded slightly higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were mixed.
Sturdy wage growth has been the missing piece in the jobs recovery, which is showing signs of rapidly accelerating. 
From unemployment claims to payrolls and job openings, the labor market is becoming robust, even as economic growth has slowed in recent months. 
Weaker demand overseas and cutbacks in capital spending by businesses in the oil sector, where profits are under strain from lower crude prices and a strong dollar, are curbing growth.
A separate report on Thursday showed factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region slowed in February to its lowest level in a year as companies struggled to get new overseas business.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 5.2, the lowest since February 2014, from a reading of 6.3 in January. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. 
MODERATE GROWTH
That weakness is likely related to softening economies in Europe and Asia as well as a strong dollar, which are expected to result in a moderation in U.S. growth in the first quarter.
""A lot of the demand has been domestically sourced, so a lot of export-oriented industries are facing headwinds given a stronger dollar and weaker global growth backdrop,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. 
""I would expect a pick-up given how quickly employment is growing and just how solid the U.S. recovery has been thus far.""
Last week, the four-week moving average of jobless claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 6,500 to 283,250.
The data covered the week that the government surveyed employers for February's nonfarm payrolls. 
The four-week moving average of claims fell 23,750 between the January and February survey period, suggesting another month of job gains above 200,000.
The economy has added more than a million jobs over the past three months, a performance last seen in 1997. A key measure of labor market slack - the number of job seekers for every open position - hit its lowest level since 2007 in December.
Most economists believe that tightening labor market conditions will trump the Federal Reserve's concerns over low inflation, allowing the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates in June. 
Minutes of the Fed's Jan. 27-28 policy meeting published on Wednesday, however, suggested policymakers were not in a hurry to hike borrowing costs because of concerns over low inflation and a weakening global economy. 

The U.S. central bank has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual exports in January jumped the most since late 2013 in an encouraging sign a weak yen is finally boosting the nation's all-important export engine and helping the economy crawl out of recession.
The 17.0 percent year-on-year gain in exports marked the fifth straight month of increase, supported by shipments of cars to the United States and of electronics parts to Asia, data by the Ministry of Finance showed.
Ministry officials say exports are on a firm footing, adding that special factors helped boost shipments such as a rebound from last year's Chinese New Year holidays which fell in January, and extreme cold weather which hit the U.S. economy a year ago.
A pickup in shipments - which had been a soft spot in the economy - is welcome news for policymakers who hope exports will offset still-weak private consumption, and cheaper oil prices will spur firms to spend more on wages and investment, generating a virtuous growth cycle.
And with the economy recovering at a subdued pace after slipping into recession last year, stronger exports growth would let the central bank hold off on any additional stimulus.
Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Wednesday he saw no need now to expand monetary stimulus as the bank raised its view on output and exports and stuck to its assessment that the world's third largest economy is recovering moderately.
""The BOJ will wait to see how oil prices may impact people's deflationary mindset, and brisk trade data will encourage Kuroda to stand pat on policy for the time being,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
A jump in export volume suggests that Japanese exporters who have gained hefty profits due to a weak yen are lowering exporting prices to boost shipments, Minami added.
Nissan Motor Co is trying to boost car exports from Japan to benefit from the weaker yen. Honda Motor Co, which has virtually no exports from Japan now, aims to ship abroad about 10-20 percent of its cars built at home.
January exports topped a 11.9 percent annual gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll, following a 12.8 percent rise in December.
Export volume grew 11.2 percent, the fastest gain since December 2010.
Imports fell 9.0 percent in the year to January, due to slumping oil prices, narrowing the trade deficit to 1.18 trillion yen ($9.94 billion), but still a record run of shortfalls stretching 31 months.
Exports to the United States rose 16.5 percent on-year in January, while those to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese exports, grew 22.7 percent, driven by a rush in demand before the Chinese New Year holidays.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices recorded their biggest drop in more than five years in January as the cost of energy and a range of other goods tumbled, hinting at a disinflationary trend that could argue against the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. 
Signs of moderate economic growth early in the first quarter could make policy decisions at the Fed difficult. Other reports on Wednesday showed housing starts fell last month, while manufacturing output rose marginally. ""That, along with persistently cool measures on inflation, will complicate decisions on the timing of a rate hike by the Fed. There is a clear consensus to obtain a liftoff this year, but the timing is still cloudy,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand fell 0.8 percent, the biggest drop since the revamped series started in November 2009, after dipping 0.2 percent in December. It was the third straight month of decline in the PPI.
In the 12 months through January, producer prices were unchanged, the weakest year-on-year reading since records started in November 2010, after rising 1.1 percent in December. 
Economists had forecast the PPI declining only 0.4 percent last month and gaining 0.3 percent from a year ago.
The decline in producer prices spilled over to the so-called core PPI as a strengthening dollar dampens imported inflation. 
A key measure of underlying producer price pressures, which excludes food, energy and trade services, fell a record 0.3 percent last month after edging up 0.1 percent in December.
While the Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, views the tame price environment as transitory, the broad-based weakness could cause discomfort among some policymakers.
""If we continue to see core prices disinflating at the current pace ... it will likely still the Fed's hand in terms of the timing of the rate hike,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
""As much as they see the weakness as temporary, it would not be favorable for them to be tightening at a time when core inflation is moving further away from the target."" 
Most economists expect the U.S. central bank to start raising interest rates in June, citing rapidly tightening labor market conditions. The Fed has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. 
U.S. Treasury debt prices rose on the data. U.S. stocks were trading lower after recent gains, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. 
STRONG DOLLAR
In a separate report, the Fed said manufacturing output rose 0.2 percent last month after being flat in December. Economists say slowing global growth, a strong dollar and lower crude oil prices are curbing factory activity.
An on-going labor dispute at key ports on the West Coast, which has caused delays in shipments, has also been blamed.
""Going forward, expect domestic producers to be more cautionary in expanding capacity as they wait to see where oil prices and the dollar will stabilize,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
Wholesale energy prices tumbled a record 10.3 percent in January after sliding 6.2 percent in December. It was the seventh straight month of declines. Weak global demand and increased shale production in the United States have created an oil glut, undercutting prices. 
Food prices posted their biggest decline since April 2013. There were huge declines in the wholesale prices of chemicals, and for services such as radio advertising, securities brokerage and television advertising.
The volatile trade services component, which reflects profit margins, rose 0.5 percent after a similar gain in December. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 2.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.07 million units in January. 
Despite the decline, which was driven by a fall in groundbreaking for single-family projects, starts remained above the one million-unit mark for a fifth straight month. 
Housing is expected to accelerate this year as a rapidly tightening labor market pushes up wages and encourages more young adults to move out of their parents' basements and set up their own homes.
Already in the fourth quarter, household formation was accelerating, breaking above the one-million mark that usually is associated with a fairly healthy housing market. 

Homebuilders such as DR Horton (N:DHI), Lennar Corp (N:LEN) and Pulte Group (N:PHM) are likely to benefit from the anticipated pick-up in starts this year.

Members Present

Financial Markets
Members commenced their discussion of financial markets with the observation that central bank policy actions, along with developments in Greece, had been the main focus of markets over the past two months.
Members were briefed about the announcement by the European Central Bank (ECB) of a large sovereign bond purchase program in January, following its assessment that its existing measures would not be sufficient to prevent inflation from remaining well below 2 per cent for a prolonged period. Starting in March, the ECB plans to purchase €60 billion of securities each month, well above the current rate of purchases of private securities; sovereign bonds would be bought in proportion to member countries' contributions to the ECB's capital. Debt purchases would continue until there was a sustained increase in inflation, but they would end no earlier than September 2016. This would increase the size of the ECB's balance sheet past its 2012 peak of €3.1 trillion. While less than the US Federal Reserve's maximum purchases of US$85 billion a month, on an annualised basis the ECB's purchases would be equivalent to around 7½ per cent of the euro area's annual GDP, compared with 6 per cent of US GDP for purchases by the Federal Reserve (and 16 per cent of Japanese GDP for purchases by the Bank of Japan).
Members noted that the Federal Reserve continued to indicate that it expected to start increasing its policy rate around the middle of this year, but financial markets had pushed back expectations for the first rate rise in the United States to around the end of the year. A number of central banks had eased policy in recent months in response to the effect of lower oil prices, including the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of Canada. Markets had also pushed back expectations for policy tightening by a number of other central banks. In contrast, the central banks of Russia and Brazil had increased their policy rates.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) abandoned its exchange rate ceiling against the euro, which had been in place since September 2011, and lowered the rate on bank deposits at the SNB by 50 basis points to −0.75 per cent. The SNB's announcement noted that divergences between the monetary policies of the major currency areas had increased significantly. The move surprised markets, resulting in considerable market volatility and the bankruptcy of several foreign exchange brokers.
Members noted that sovereign bond yields in the major markets had fallen significantly since the December meeting. The falls had occurred across the yield curve but were particularly pronounced at longer maturities, with yields on 10-year bonds in the United States falling back to around 1.6 per cent and those in Germany and Japan reaching historic lows of 30 and 20 basis points, respectively. At these levels there was very little, if any, compensation for term risk. For maturities up to five years, yields on bonds issued by Japan, Germany and most of the core euro area economies, as well as Sweden and Switzerland, had fallen below zero. Yields on Australian government bonds had mostly tracked global developments and had also fallen considerably, with the 10-year yield declining to a historical low below 2½ per cent.
The declines in global bond yields reflected a number of factors but the extent of the decline in yields was difficult to explain. The large bond purchases by major central banks had clearly contributed but so too had a reduction in bond supply, reflecting a narrowing of fiscal deficits in a number of countries. Concerns about the global growth outlook and the risk of sustained low inflation following falls in the oil price had also played a role.
Members noted that the Greek authorities had indicated that they planned to restructure the country's debt, most of which was owed to official sector institutions. Greece had nonetheless also indicated a desire to remain part of the euro area. The current European assistance program expired at the end of February and markets had been closed to Greece since the recent election. Members also noted that the critical issue in the near term was not so much the obligations of the Greek Government but rather the funding of Greek banks. To date, there had been minimal spillover from developments in Greece to other markets.
There had been sizeable movements in exchange rates since the December meeting, reflecting the increasingly divergent paths of monetary policy among the major advanced economies. Most notably, the Swiss franc had appreciated by around 15 per cent against the euro since mid January. While the US dollar had depreciated against the Swiss franc, it had also appreciated further against most other currencies since the December meeting (including by around 10 per cent against the euro). The renminbi had been little changed against the US dollar over much of 2014, but had depreciated somewhat since the December meeting.
The Australian dollar had depreciated by around 9 per cent against the US dollar since the December meeting. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar was around 4 per cent below its early 2014 levels, notwithstanding significant falls in commodity prices over the intervening period. The depreciation of the Australian dollar against the US dollar and renminbi had been partly offset by its appreciation against the yen and euro.
Equity prices in advanced economies had been broadly unchanged since early December, notwithstanding a strong rally in European share prices following the announcement of the expansion of the ECB asset purchase program. Global equity prices had risen moderately over 2014, led by an 11 per cent increase in US equity prices, while Chinese equities had significantly outperformed other emerging markets since mid 2014.
In Australia, equity prices recorded a smaller rise over 2014 than that recorded in most global markets, primarily reflecting the decline in equity prices of resource companies. Equity prices had increased by 4 per cent since the start of 2015 even though prices of resource companies had fallen further.
Members noted that Australian lending rates on the outstanding stock of housing and business loans had continued to edge down since the December meeting. At the time of the December meeting, financial market pricing had suggested some chance of an easing in policy during 2015. This expectation strengthened somewhat during January, and by the time of the February meeting pricing reflected a two-thirds probability of a 25 basis point reduction in the cash rate at that meeting, with the cash rate expected to be 2 per cent by the end of the year.
International Economic Conditions
Members noted that growth of Australia's major trading partners had been around its long-run average in 2014 and that early indications suggested this pace had continued into 2015. Prices of a range of commodities, notably oil and iron ore, had fallen further in recent months, reflecting a combination of both lower growth in global demand for commodities and, more importantly, significant increases in supply. Members also noted that the lower oil prices, if sustained, would be positive for the growth of Australia's trading partners, which are net importers of energy, and would continue to put downward pressure on global prices of goods and services. Very accommodative global financial conditions were also expected to support global growth in 2015. These positive effects on trading partner growth, however, were expected to be largely offset in 2015 by a gradual decline in the pace of growth in China.
In China, economic growth had eased a little but was close to the authorities' target for 2014. Growth of household consumption had held up over 2014, while growth of investment and industrial production – which contribute significantly to the demand for commodities – had trended lower over the past year or so. Conditions in the residential property market had remained weak, and measures introduced to support the market appear to have had only a modest effect so far.
In Japan, economic activity had been weaker than expected since the increase in the consumption tax in April 2014, but growth appeared to have resumed in the December quarter and the labour market remained tight. However, inflation had declined in recent months and remained well below the Bank of Japan's target. The pace of growth had slowed a little in the rest of east Asia over 2014; as the region as a whole is a net importer of oil, activity was likely to have been supported by the decline in oil prices.
Members observed that the US economy had continued to strengthen, resulting in output growing at an above-trend pace over the second half of 2014. Employment growth had picked up further and the unemployment rate had continued to decline. Ongoing strength in the labour market and lower gasoline prices had contributed to a sharp rise in consumer sentiment. On the other hand, growth in the euro area remained modest. Inflation had remained well below the ECB's target and inflation expectations had declined further, prompting the ECB to implement additional stimulus measures.Domestic Economic Conditions
Members noted that the data released since the December meeting suggested that the domestic economy had continued to grow at a below-trend pace over the second half of 2014. Resource exports appeared to have continued growing in the December quarter and growth was expected to remain strong, particularly as liquefied natural gas (LNG) production came on line over the next year or so. The lower exchange rate was expected to support growth of exports, particularly service exports such as education and tourism.
Activity and prices in the housing market had continued to be bolstered by the low level of lending rates and strong population growth. A range of indicators, including residential building approvals, suggested further growth of dwelling investment in the near term. Housing price inflation had moderated from the rapid rates seen in late 2013, but remained high and in Sydney and Melbourne had been well above the growth rate of household income. Growth of owner-occupier housing credit had remained around 6 per cent in year-ended terms, while investor credit had continued to grow at a noticeably faster rate.
Members were briefed on the main regulatory actions taken recently to address housing risks in the domestic economy. In particular, the Australian Prudential (LONDON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) had announced several policy measures in early December to reinforce sound residential mortgage lending practices. These policies included clarification of prudential expectations on what constituted acceptable growth in housing lending to investors and the possible steps that would be considered if APRA's expectations were not met, such as increased capital requirements.
Turning to the business sector, members noted that mining investment had continued to decline in the second half of 2014, and larger declines were expected over 2015 as existing projects were completed and very few new projects were likely to proceed. Non-mining business investment had remained subdued and recent data pointed to this continuing into the first half of 2015. Growth in public demand was expected to be subdued over the next year or so.
Members observed that household consumption growth had picked up since its lows in early 2013, supported by low interest rates and rising housing wealth. However, consumption growth had remained below average. The recent decline in fuel prices was expected to provide some offset for overall household incomes from weak growth in labour incomes.
Members noted that the most recent data on the labour market had been a little more positive than early in 2014. However, while employment growth had strengthened somewhat over the past year, the unemployment rate had increased further over 2014 and average hours worked had remained below the levels of a few years ago. Leading indicators of labour demand had changed little in recent months and pointed to only modest employment growth in the months ahead.
Consumer price inflation had declined in year-ended terms, partly as a result of a large fall in fuel prices in the December quarter and the effect of the repeal of the carbon price on utility prices in the September quarter. Various measures of underlying inflation, which largely abstract from these and other temporary factors, had declined in year-ended terms to around 2¼ per cent. Non-tradables inflation (excluding utility prices) had declined further in year-ended terms to relatively low levels, consistent with subdued domestic cost pressures. Prices of tradable items (excluding volatile items and tobacco) were little changed in the December quarter, but were expected to face upward pressure over time from the pass-through of the depreciation of the Australian dollar since early 2013.
Turning their discussion to the economic outlook, members noted that staff forecasts for output, which were conditioned on an assumption of no change in the cash rate, had been revised lower in the near term. Recent data indicated that the expected pick-up in consumption and non-mining business investment was likely to occur later than had been previously anticipated, while the pick-up in LNG exports over coming quarters was now likely to be less rapid. At the same time, it was anticipated that the net effect of commodity price changes and the exchange rate depreciation over the past three months would provide a positive impetus to domestic growth over the next year or so. Overall, the underlying forces driving growth remained much as they had been for some time and GDP growth was still expected to pick up gradually to an above-trend pace in the latter part of the forecast period.
The revisions to GDP growth implied that the unemployment rate would peak at a higher rate and later than had been previously forecast, before declining gradually. The inflation forecast had also been revised lower, reflecting the softer outlook for labour and product markets as well as the recent fall in oil prices. Headline inflation was expected to remain low for a time, before picking up at the end of the forecast period. Underlying inflation was expected to remain well contained and consistent with the target throughout the forecast period.
Members discussed a number of uncertainties around the forecasts. They noted that developments in commodity markets, particularly the price of oil, would affect future global growth and inflation outcomes. One area of uncertainty continued to be the outlook for the Chinese property market and its implications for Chinese demand for commodities. Members also noted that developments in commodity markets were likely to be affected by supply factors; for instance, the response of ‘unconventional’ oil producers in North America to lower oil prices.
As usual, the path of the exchange rate remained a key area of uncertainty. Members noted that the exchange rate had remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, given the decline in commodity prices over the past year, and that future exchange rate movements would be affected by market expectations for monetary policy, both domestically and abroad. They noted that, all else being equal, a sustained further depreciation would, if it occurred, stimulate growth in the domestic economy and put some temporary upward pressure on inflation.
Members noted that there was considerable uncertainty around the timing and extent of the expected increase in household consumption growth and non-mining business investment. Although fundamental factors such as low interest rates and strong population growth remained in place, they had not been sufficient to see a significant pick-up in the growth of these variables or a decline in the degree of spare capacity in the labour market. In addition, recent data suggested that the expected improvement in economic conditions would occur later than had been previously expected. Members commented that a strengthening in non-mining investment was a necessary element for growth to pick up to an above-trend pace, and noted the importance of confidence in underpinning such an outcome. Indeed, an improvement in the appetite for businesses to take on risk had the potential, should it occur, to lead to much stronger growth in non-mining business investment than currently forecast.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
In assessing the appropriate stance for monetary policy in Australia, members noted that the outlook for global economic growth was little changed, with Australia's major trading partners still forecast to grow by around the pace of recent years in 2015. Commodity prices, particularly those for iron ore and oil, had declined over the past year largely in response to expansions in global supply, though members judged that demand-side factors, such as the weakness in Chinese property markets, had also played some role. Conditions in global financial markets had remained very accommodative.
Domestically, over recent months there had been fewer indications of a near-term strengthening in growth than previous forecasts would have implied. This included survey measures of household and business confidence, which remained around or even a bit below average. As a result, the revised staff forecasts – which were based on an unchanged cash rate – suggested that GDP growth would remain below trend over the course of this year, before gradually picking up to an above-trend pace in 2016, somewhat later than had been previously expected. The unemployment rate was therefore expected to peak a little higher (and later) than in the previous forecast. The net effect of declining commodity prices and the depreciation of the exchange rate was expected to boost growth over the forecast period. Nonetheless, the higher degree of spare capacity now in prospect and lower oil prices had led to a lowering of the forecast for inflation, offset somewhat by the effects of the recent exchange rate depreciation. The restrained pace of wage increases over the past year or so and accompanying growth in productivity, which had dampened growth in unit labour costs, suggested that low rates of inflation were likely to be sustained. In other respects, the forces underpinning the outlook for domestic activity and inflation were much as they had been for some time.
Members noted the current accommodative setting of monetary policy, which had been providing support to domestic demand. They noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated noticeably against a rising US dollar over recent months, although less so against a basket of currencies, and that it remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. Members agreed that a lower exchange rate was likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy.
Given the large increases in housing prices in some cities and ongoing strength in lending to investors in housing assets, members also agreed that developments in the housing market would bear careful monitoring. They noted that it would be important to assess the effects of the measures designed to reinforce sound residential mortgage lending practices announced by APRA in December.
On the basis of their assessment of current conditions and taking into account the revised forecasts, the Board judged that a further reduction in the cash rate would be appropriate to provide additional support to demand, while inflation outcomes were expected to remain consistent with the 2 to 3 per cent target. In deciding the timing of such a change, members assessed arguments for acting at this meeting or at the following meeting. On balance, they judged that moving at this meeting, which offered the opportunity of early additional communication in the forthcoming Statement on Monetary Policy, was the preferred course.
The Decision
The Board decided to lower the cash rate by 25 basis points to 2.25 per cent, effective 4 February 2015.

707,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2015 11:16PM ET</span>",China January FDI grows at strongest pace in four years,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Foreign direct investment (FDI) in China grew at its strongest pace in nearly four years in January, surging 29.4 percent from a year earlier to $13.9 billion as investors largely shunned the troubled manufacturing sector and focused on the more resilient services industry.
But analysts cautioned about reading too much into economic indicators for January alone, given the strong seasonal distortions caused by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays, which began on Jan. 31 last year but start on Feb. 19 this year.
January FDI rose 4.5 percent from December, the Commerce Ministry said on Monday. In terms of value, January FDI was the highest since June 2014.
Earlier data showed FDI in China rose just 1.7 percent in 2014, the slackest pace since 2012. The weak performance underscored a cooling economy which is spurring more Chinese firms to plow money into assets overseas in a trend that is soon set to overtake inbound investment.
Foreign direct investment is an important gauge of the health of the world economy and is also a good indicator of where capital is flowing within the country.
Shen Danyang, the ministry's spokesman, told reporters that China's foreign direct investment will be stable for 2015, but it was too early to predict whether China will continue to be the world leader in attracting FDI this year.
China overtook the United States to become the top destination for FDI in 2014, largely due to falling inflows caused by a deal between U.S. firm Verizon Communications Inc (N:VZ) and its British partner Vodafone (L:VOD), according to the United Nations economic think-tank UNCTAD.
""We are fully confident that China's FDI will be among the highest in the world (this year),"" Shen said.
But he conceded that China's foreign trade still faces many uncertainties as the global economic recovery remains fragile.
He added that while the world's second-largest economy should pay attention to deflationary risks, China has not sunk into a deflationary cycle.
In January, the top 10 investors, led by Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan, made up for 96.5 percent of China's FDI, the ministry said.
In line with China's manufacturing slowdown, the data showed investors were flocking to the services industry, which has remained relatively buoyant.
Foreign direct investment in the services sector hit $9.2 billion in January, up 45.1 percent from a year earlier and accounting for 66 percent of total FDI.
China's outbound direct investment (ODI) hit $10.2 billion in January, up 40.6 percent from a year earlier, the ministry said.
Last year, China drew a record $119.6 billion worth of FDI, while ODI surged 14.1 percent to a new high of $102.9 billion.

The government has been encouraging Chinese firms to invest abroad to help them become more competitive internationally, utilize their surplus capacity, and help slow down the rapid build-up of foreign exchange reserves.

708,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2015 10:02PM ET</span>",Japan emerges from recession but growth subdued,"By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy rebounded from recession in the final quarter of last year but growth was weaker than expected as household and corporate spending disappointed, underlining the challenge premier Shinzo Abe faces in shaking off decades of stagnation.
The annualized 2.2 percent expansion in October-December was smaller than a 3.7 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll, suggesting a fragile recovery as the hangover from last year's sales tax hike lingered.
The preliminary reading for gross domestic product (GDP), which translates into a quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.6 percent, follows two straight quarters of contraction, data by the Cabinet Office showed on Monday.
Economic Minister Akira Amari told reporters after the data's release that the economy was on track for a recovery with signs consumer sentiment is picking up.
But analysts pointed to the weak rebound in consumption and capital expenditure as worrying signs to the outlook.
""These are somewhat disappointing figures,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""The situation remains weak and companies are clearly postponing investments.""
BOJ ON HOLD 
The rebound from recession, however, will allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus for now even as slumping oil prices push inflation further away from its 2 percent target, analysts say.
""The BOJ is expected to keep monetary policy unchanged for a while to see the impact from the latest easing,"" said Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute.
The data will be one of the key factors the BOJ will scrutinize at its two-day rate review ending on Wednesday, where it is widely set to maintain the current pace of asset purchases in its monetary stimulus program.
Private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of the economy, rose 0.3 percent in the final quarter, less than a median market forecast for a 0.7 percent increase.
Capital expenditure also rose just 0.1 percent after two straight quarters of declines, suggesting the BOJ's aggressive money printing has yet to nudge firms into boosting investment.
In a glimmer of hope, external demand added 0.2 percentage point to growth on robust shipments to the United States and China, Japan's two biggest export destinations.
One of the biggest headwinds for Japan is a deteriorating global economic outlook, which has triggered a wave of monetary easings around the world to fight of deflationary pressures and prop up growth. 
But Japanese policymakers are hoping a rebound in exports, which had been a soft spot in the economy despite support from a weak yen, and lower fuel costs will encourage firms to spend more on wages and expenditure.
""The economy will recover backed by firm domestic demand as Japan's terms of trade improves on oil price falls,"" Amari said.
Japan's economy slid into recession in July-September last year, prompting Abe to delay a second sales tax hike initially scheduled in October 2015.

The slump slowed Japan's quest to beat off nearly two decades of grinding deflation, and forced the BOJ into expanding monetary stimulus in October last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in February from an 11-year high amid worries over slowing economic growth, suggesting a recent weakness in spending might last for a while.
The ebb in sentiment came despite strong job gains over the last three months, signs of an acceleration in wage growth as well as cheaper gasoline prices, factors that economists had expected would buoy consumer spending in the months ahead.
""As it stands, the pullback in confidence, along with the early-year decline in retail sales, hints of slower consumer spending growth in the first quarter,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The University of Michigan said on Friday its consumer sentiment index slipped to 93.6 in early February from a reading of 98.1 in January. The drop could reflect an uptick in gasoline prices early this month.
Still, the index was at the second highest level since January 2007. Economists had expected the sentiment index to hold steady.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
Households were in early February less upbeat about current economic conditions as well as the outlook over the next six months.
The survey also showed a fairly big fall in household intentions to purchase long-lasting manufactured goods, while plans to buy automobiles were little changed.
There was also some softening in income expectations. A special question in the survey showed a greater propensity to save, which could explain the recent weakness in retail sales.
""The decline in income expectations is an unfavorable sign for consumer spending,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
""Increased savings is a possible explanation for why consumption has disappointed in recent months despite consumers receiving a windfall from the drop in gasoline prices, but it is hard to really know what to make of the responses to this question because it was last asked in 2010.""
SPENDING LAG
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, weakened in December and January, surprising economists who had hoped that lower gasoline prices and a relatively robust jobs market would unleash a wave of discretionary spending.
But cheaper gasoline can still boost consumer spending, a sentiment expressed this week by a top executive at PepsiCo Inc (N:PEP).
""It takes a number of months before the consumer fully spends back the so-called benefit from lower gas prices,"" said Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo chief financial officer.
""You are going to see that over the course of six to eight months rather than an immediate change in consumer behavior, it just sort of assimilates over time."" Softer consumer spending has prompted economists to lower their estimates for first-quarter growth. Still, they are optimistic about prospects for the rest of this year.
Growth this year is expected to be the strongest since 2005, driven in part by consumer spending, especially with the labor market gathering momentum. The economy added more than a million jobs in the last three months, a performance last seen in 1997.
""Consumer sentiment still remains at a relatively high level and paints a generally healthy picture of consumer perceptions of the economy,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed import prices recorded their biggest drop in six years in January as the cost of petroleum and a range of other goods fell, pointing to muted inflation pressures in the near term.
Import prices tumbled 2.8 percent last month, the largest decline since December 2008, after sliding 1.9 percent in December. The seventh straight month of declines in import prices also reflected the dollar's significant strength against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners.
""This report sets the stage for declines in both the producer and consumer inflation in January,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
""However, we believe the U.S. economy is experiencing an adjustment to much lower energy prices and that this does not signal the emergence of a sustained deflationary dynamic.""In the 12 months through January prices declined 8.0 percent, the largest year-on-year drop since September 2009.

The University of Michigan's preliminary February reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 93.6, below the final January read of 98.1. It was below the median forecast of 98.1 among economists polled by Reuters.
""Although confidence reversed the January gain, returning to the December level, the Sentiment Index was still higher than any other time since January 2007,"" said Richard Curtin, the survey's director.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 103.1 from 109.3, below a forecast of 110.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations slipped to 87.5 from 91, below an expected 92.2.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation was 2.8 percent, compared with 2.5 percent in January.

BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth accelerated unexpectedly in the final quarter of 2014 as the bloc's largest member, Germany, expanded at more than twice the expected rate.
A preliminary estimate showed the economy of the 18 countries sharing the euro expanded by 0.3 percent between October and December compared with the previous three months, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Friday.
A Reuters poll of 51 economists had forecast a 0.2 percent expansion, the same rate as in the third quarter.
Year-on-year, euro zone growth was 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, also 0.1 percentage points higher than expected.
The euro zone's biggest economy, Germany was a clear outperformer, growing by 0.7 percent in the quarter, far surpassing expectations of a 0.3 percent rise.
It marked a return to solid expansion in Germany after two quarters close to zero, boosting the growth rate for the whole of last year to 1.6 percent
Domestic demand lifted Germany out of its mid-year lull and allowed it to achieve 2014 growth of 1.6 percent. The Statistics Office said a significant pick up in household spending had helped overcome the summer slowdown. 
""This is a thunderbolt,"" UniCredit economist Andreas Rees said. ""Some spoke of possible recession after the summer but instead Germany rebounded. The fact that the growth comes mainly from the domestic economy gives strong grounds for optimism."" 
France could not keep pace, growing by just 0.1 percent, meaning the euro zone's second largest economy advanced by just 0.4 percent across the whole of 2014. Italy fared even worse.
""It's obviously still too weak, but the conditions are ripe to permit a cleaner start of activity in 2015,"" said French finance minister Michel Sapin, adding that business leaders were already beginning to increase investment.
On Monday, France's central bank predicted first quarter growth of 0.4 percent, led by a rise in industrial production and a slight improvement in services activity.
With Greece's place in the euro zone again uncertain, there is plenty of turbulence for the currency bloc to contend with. 
But a halving of the price of oil and the prospect of the European Central Bank buying more than 1 trillion euros ($1.1 trillion) of government bonds with new money over the next 18 months should start to spur growth.
Latest data suggest a slightly more buoyant start to the year. The January purchasing managers survey produced the best showing for euro zone firms since mid-2014 and pointed to first quarter growth of 0.3 percent. 
ITALIAN PAIN, SPANISH GAIN, GREEK DIP
In Greece, the economy contracted by 0.2 percent in the final three months of last year after three consecutive quarters of growth. That marked a 1.7 percent increase from the same period a year earlier, but was below the 2.2 percent forecast. 
The twice-bailed-out country's economy had been expected to show it has put a long and savage recession behind it, at least while it remains firmly part of the euro zone.
Italy's economy stagnated in Q4, marking the 14th consecutive quarter without any growth as an increase in exports was offset by weak domestic demand.
Over the whole of 2014 GDP fell 0.4 percent, the third consecutive decline after contractions of 1.9 percent in 2013 and 2.3 percent in 2012. 
Spain released its Q4 figures two weeks ago and boasted quarterly growth of 0.7 percent, the fastest in seven years.
Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told Reuters last week that forecasts for 2015 could soon be lifted as high as 3 percent. 

The Dutch economy grew a healthy 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.

734,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2015 12:06PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales data point to slower economic growth,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending barely rose in January as households cut back on purchases of a range of goods, suggesting the economy started the first quarter on a softer note.
Sluggish spending came despite cheap gasoline and a buoyant labor market, leaving economists to speculate that consumers were using the extra income to pay down debt and boost savings. 
""There is a risk of a temporary soft patch for the economy as it is somewhat surprising the consumer has stopped spending their savings from gasoline prices,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services edged up 0.1 percent last month. 
That followed a 0.3 percent drop in December and was below Wall Street's expectations for a 0.4 percent increase.
The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Overall retail sales slipped 0.8 percent in January, declining for a second straight month as falling gasoline prices undercut sales at service stations.
The soft core retail sales prompted Barclays to lower its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.2 percent annual rate. JPMorgan cut its estimate to a 2.5 percent rate from a 3 percent pace.
The economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter. However, inventory and trade data for December was below the government's assumptions in the GDP report, suggesting growth could be revised to as low as a 1.8 percent rate.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by Thursday's data, with attention focused on details of a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine and a surprise interest rate cut and bond purchasing program announced by Sweden's central bank. 
WAITING FOR TAKE-OFF
Despite a 39.5 percent decline in gasoline prices since June, consumer spending has been soft in the past two months. 
Still, cheaper gasoline prices and robust employment gains are expected to provide a powerful stimulus to consumer spending and keep the economy on an expansion path, despite sputtering growth in Asia and Europe.
""Should we be worried about the weakness of underlying sales over the past two months? Possibly,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
""But all the conditions are in place for a period of very strong consumption growth. We still expect to see that strength come through in the retail sales data soon.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, expanded at its quickest pace since 2006 in the fourth quarter. 
Softer consumer spending posed a risk to a much anticipated mid-year interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
""In practice, the Fed cares a lot about GDP growth. GDP has disappointed while the labor market hasn't,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""All else equal, the continued unexciting pace of GDP growth does present a modest challenge to our June Fed call.""
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 304,000 last week. 
The underlying trend, however, remained consistent with a strengthening jobs market.
Difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal variations have caused volatility in recent weeks. 
The four-week moving average of claims, seen as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 289,750 last week.
""Jobless claims still remain in a range that has historically been highly constructive for the jobs market,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  

The economy has added more than a million jobs over the past three months, an achievement last seen in 1997. A key measure of labor market slack - the number of job seekers for every open position - hit its lowest level since 2007 in December.

""Overall, the tone of this report was disappointing as it points to a weak start to spending activity this year, despite the significant boost to disposable income from lower gasoline prices,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Wall Street had expected core retail sales to increase 0.4 percent last month. The soft reading could see economists trim their forecasts for first-quarter GDP growth. The economy grew at a 2.6 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter.
U.S. stock index futures pared gains on the data, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices cut losses.

""With gasoline prices remaining low (providing a huge windfall to U.S. consumers), confidence sky-high and the buoyancy in labor market activity likely to bolster household income, we expect consumer spending activity to rebound strongly in the coming months,"" Mulraine said.

A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 25,000 to a seasonally adjusted 304,000 last week, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a strengthening labor market.
Difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations caused volatility in recent weeks. 
The four-week moving average of claims, seen as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 289,750 last week.
The economy has added more than a million jobs over the past three months, an achievement last seen in 1997. A key measure of labor market slack - the number of job seekers for every open position - hit its lowest level since 2007 in December. 
In January, core retail sales were held back by a 0.7 percent drop in furniture and home furnishings sales, the biggest decline in this category since December 2013. 
Receipts at clothing stores fell 0.8 percent, while sales at sporting goods stores were down 2.6 percent, their biggest drop in a year. Receipts at online stores rose 0.5 percent, while sales at electronic and appliance stores gained 0.3 percent.
Declining gasoline prices undercut sales at service stations, where receipts plunged 9.3 percent, the biggest fall since December 2008.
Weaker gasoline receipts and a 0.5 percent drop in automobile sales pushed overall retail sales down 0.8 percent last month. It was the second straight monthly decline. 

Sales for building materials and garden equipment rose 0.6 percent, likely boosted by preparation for a blizzard in the U.S. Northeast. Sales at restaurants and bars rose 0.8 percent.

742,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 12, 2015 06:46AM ET</span>","UK Headed For Negative Inflation, Bank Of England Warns","By Aditya Tejas -

The Bank of England (BoE) warned Thursday that inflation is likely to fall below zero. However, it said there was no threat of persistent deflation. BoE Governor Mark Carney said he expected inflation to fall due to dipping oil prices, but believed there was little long-term risk.
""The UK is not experiencing 'deflation',"" Carney said in a letter to Finance Minister George Osborne, Reuters reported.
During its quarterly report on inflation, BoE said that inflation was likely to pick up at the end of the year, rising quickly and that markets were responding to expectations of no interest rate rises this year, Financial Times reported.
The central bank stressed that its forecasts were dependent on many uncertain conditions, and probed the possibility of cutting interest rates to less than 0.5 percent, if global events meant that Britain risked entering a deflationary spiral.
This marks a change from its previous policy, where it said cutting interest rates would offer little benefit and squeeze out some lenders who were too weak to cope with such low rates.
The overall tone of the report was positive, with the central bank reporting that the economy was almost operating at full capacity once more. It revised its growth forecasts upward, and predicted that wage growth would also increase, suggesting that voters were likely to feel the effects of Britain’s economic rebound before the general election on May 7.
Current interest rates in the U.K. are diverging widely from BoE’s projections of 2 percent, seemingly contradicting the otherwise strong economic indicators the country is showing.
Carney stressed in his letter that circumstances would change as the world’s economic outlook improved, and there was no structural weakness indicated in the figure.
Britain’s economic outlook has improved steadily since 2013, though both real wages and productivity are well below their pre-2008 levels."

744,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 12, 2015 04:45AM ET</span>","Sweden's Central Bank Cuts Key Rate To Negative, Launches QE","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - The Swedish central bank shocked markets on Thursday by cutting its key interest rate into negative territory, launching bond purchases and saying it stood ready to take further measures at short notice as it battled the threat of deflation.
Negative rates take Sweden into a select club of countries which have experimented with a measure that was rejected by many economists as unfeasible until the financial crisis.
""To ensure that inflation rises towards the target, the Riksbank is prepared to quickly make monetary policy more expansionary, even between the ordinary monetary policy meetings, should the need arise,"" the central bank said in a statement.
The majority of analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast no change this month and only a minority believed the Riksbank would launch further measures like bond buying to boost inflation either now or later.
The Riksbank said it would ""soon"" make purchases of nominal government bonds with maturities from 1 year up to around 5 years for a sum of 10 billion Swedish crowns ($1.17 billion).
The repo rate is seen remaining at the current level until underlying inflation is close to the Riksbank's 2 per cent target.
Sweden's central bank has been facing a policy conundrum, with the economy flirting with deflation while output grows at a stronger pace than most other European countries.
Headline consumer prices fell or were flat on an annual basis in every month but one last year and the effect of lower oil prices has yet to be fully felt.
However, the economy is expected to grow 2.7 percent this year and accelerate again in 2016. Household debt, already one of the highest in Europe, is also rising thanks to cheap credit.
The rate cut puts Sweden alongside Switzerland and Denmark in having negative rates.
Four cuts in the last month have taken Denmark's main policy rate to -0.75 percent as it defends its currency peg to the euro. The Danes have also spent at least 100 billion crowns ($15.20 billion) in the currency market and called a halt to bond sales."

The Riksbank said it was lowering the benchmark interest rate by 10 basis points to -0.10% from 0.0%, surprising most market analysts, who expected rates to hold steady.
In addition, the central bank said it will purchase government bonds for a sum of SEK10 billion and that it is prepared to do more at short notice.
In a statement accompanying the announcement, the central bank said, ""There are signs that underlying inflation has bottomed out, but the situation abroad is now more uncertain and this increases the risk that inflation will not rise sufficiently fast.""
Following the announcement, the Krona plunged against the U.S. dollar, with USD/SEK rising 0.93% to trade at 8.4427, compared to 8.3753 ahead of the decision.
The Krona was also down sharply against the euro, with EUR/SEK jumping 0.94% to hit 9.5798 from around 9.4922 earlier.

A total of 37,292 homes were repossessed in January, a 15-month high. Overall, 119,888 properties were at some stage of the foreclosure process, still down 4 percent from a year earlier.
The unwinding of distressed housing assets, a multiyear legal process in many states, was gathering pace, RealtyTrac said.
A nationwide increase in scheduled foreclosure auctions in 21 states in January reflected that they were ""coming off somewhat artificially low levels last year,"" RealtyTrac Vice President Daren Blomquist said in a statement. 
He said foreclosure filings would rise over the next several months as lenders ramp up ""spring cleaning"" in many states.
A total of 51,782 homes were set for foreclosure auctions last month, up 8 percent from December but down 7 percent from a year earlier.
Lenders began the foreclosure process on 48,838 homes, down 18 percent from a 17-month high in December and a drop of 15 percent year on year. That figures also includes scheduled foreclosure auctions in some states.

Despite a 21 percent decline from a year earlier, Florida still had the nation's highest foreclosure rate in January, followed by Nevada, Maryland, Illinois and New Jersey.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories barely rose in December, the latest suggestion that economic growth in the fourth quarter was even slower than initially thought.
Still, the economic outlook remains buoyant, with other data on Tuesday showing job openings in December vaulting to their highest level since early 2001.
""The labor market is shifting into overdrive with jobs out there for nearly everyone. The litmus test for whether or not the expansion is on track and a solid one is always jobs creation,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Wholesale inventories gained 0.1 percent as lower crude oil prices depressed the value of petroleum stocks in December, the Commerce Department said. It reported an advance of 0.8 percent in November.
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - nudged up 0.1 percent.
That, together with data last week showing a 0.3 percent fall in manufacturing inventories in December, suggested the boost to GDP growth from restocking in the fourth quarter was probably not as large as initially thought.
The U.S. government estimated last month that inventories added 0.8 percentage point to the economy's annualized 2.6 percent growth pace in the fourth quarter. 
Economists said the data in hand suggested that contribution could be cut by at least five-tenths of a percentage point, lowering the fourth-quarter GDP growth rate to 1.7 percent. 
Prior to Tuesday's inventories data, a larger-than-anticipated trade deficit in December had led economists to expect that GDP growth could be lowered by as much as 0.4 percentage point in the fourth quarter.
STRONG JOBS MARKET
The government will publish its revised GDP growth estimate later this month. The moderate pace of inventory accumulation, however, could be a boost to first-quarter growth, which also continues to be supported by a strengthening labor market.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Labor Department said job openings surged to 5.03 million in December, the highest level since January 2001, from 4.85 million in November. 
Hiring jumped to a seven-year high, while the number of job seekers for every open position - a key measure of labor market slack - fell to 1.73 in December, the lowest since 2007. 
Government data last Friday showed the economy added more than a million jobs over the past three months, a feat last achieved in late 1997.
Economists said the labor market was tightening enough for the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates by mid-year. It has kept its key short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
""Between the solid growth in labor demand and what we view as little remaining labor market slack, we expect that a modest pick-up in wage growth will give Fed policymakers the confidence in the inflation outlook needed to move toward an initial rate hike by mid-year,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
The increase in the number of people receiving a paycheck, combined with the stimulus from lower gasoline prices, should boost consumer spending and blunt the blow on the economy from weaker exports and business investment.
In a third report on Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index fell 2.5 points to 97.9 last month, reversing December's gains, which had taken the index over 100 for the first time in eight years.

""We are not too worried by the fall since many of the key sub-indices held up well. That drop back is a bit hard to square with the strength of consumer confidence,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

(Reuters) - China's annual consumer inflation hit a five-year low in January while factory deflation deepened, underscoring persistent weakness in the economy and heaping more pressures on policymakers to step up their efforts to support growth.
The risk of deflation is rising as the world's second-largest economy faces headwinds from a property market downturn and widespread factory overcapacity, and the situation may have been worsened by falling global commodity prices, analysts say.
The consumer price index rose 0.8 percent in January from December, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. That was the weakest reading since November 2009, when consumer prices rose 0.6 percent from a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected annual consumer inflation to be 1.0 percent in January, compared with 1.5 percent in December.
""This will likely be the low point for CPI inflation given that oil is rebounding. Still, the data will increase rate cut expectations and we see a cut in March,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.
Indeed, producer price index for January declined for the 35th consecutive time, highlighting the need for policymakers to bolster stimulus and head off the risk of deflation.
The PPI declined 4.3 percent from a year earlier, as sluggish demand curbed the pricing power of companies, and marked the biggest fall since October 2009.
The market had expected a 3.8 percent fall in producer prices after a drop of 3.3 percent in December.
Data over the weekend showed a surprising plunge in China's imports, suggesting China'seconomy is still losing momentum despite a raft of stimulus measures. Still, the impact of holidays may have distorted the extent of the downturn.
The People's Bank of China is widely expected to loosen policy further after cutting bank reserve requirements last week for the first time in over two years, seen as a mostly defensive move against capital outflows.
That followed a surprise cut to benchmark interest rates in November, also the first such move in more than two years, to lower borrowing costs to support growth.
The government is expected to lower its GDP target to around 7 percent this year, after posting 7.4 percent in 2014 - the slowest pace in 24 years."

790,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 09, 2015 05:31AM ET</span>",India's Economy Seen Rising Through Fog Of Data,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Taken at face value India will post robust quarterly growth figures on Monday, but changes in the way Asia's third largest economy is measured has left analysts and the government's own chief economic advisor doubting how far the data can be trusted.
Just over a week ago, everyone was working under the assumption that India was still struggling to gather momentum under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reform-minded government.
Prior to Modi's election in May, the economy had endured its weakest phase of growth since the mid-1980s.
Then India's statisticians re-worked the numbers, changing both the way it calculates gross domestic product and the base year. Suddenly the economy appeared to be motoring again.
Growth for 2013/14 was put at 6.9 percent, way above the 4.7 percent previously reported. Unfortunately, the overall size of the economy shrank slightly, somewhat spoiling the story.
Surjit Bhalla, chairman of Oxus Investments and a former World Bank economist who has served on several government committees, distrusted the reliability of the Central Statistical Office's new data series.
""Why question the surge in GDP growth in 2013/14? Because the CSO revisions do not pass a basic smell test,"" Bhalla wrote in the Indian Express on Saturday, particularly questioning data for investment and government consumption spending.
On Monday, India will report GDP data for the quarter ending in December, and recalculate growth, using the new method, for the first half of fiscal 2014/15, having originally reported it at 5.5 percent. It will no longer provide data based on the old formula.
The changes have left economists groping for a trend.
""The revisions have yet to be applied to quarterly data from this fiscal year, meaning that the latest GDP numbers are redundant for now,"" said Shilan Shah, India Economist at Capital Economics.
The CSO will also give its expectations of growth for the full year.
Using the old methodology, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has projected growth of around 5.5 percent for the fiscal year ending in March. Analysts at Nomura now expect that to be bumped up to around 6 percent under the new method.
Other indicators, however, such as industrial production and trade, suggest the economy is still suffering from slack.
India now measures GDP by market prices instead of factor costs, to take into account gross value addition in goods and services as well as indirect taxes. The base year has been shifted to 2011/12 from 2004/05 earlier.
The statistics department says the new way is more in line with global practices and gives a better picture of economic activity.
""MYSTIFYING""
The statistical fog will be a problem for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley as he drafts an annual budget that could be crucial to lifting the economy out of a lengthy rut.
Presenting the 2015/16 budget on Feb. 28, Jaitley is widely expected to boost capital spending and offer tax breaks to an under-performing manufacturing sector.
The revised GDP data may make it harder for Jaitley to assess the size of the fiscal stimulus required to help restore the economy to the even higher growth rates needed to generate jobs for millions of young Indians entering the labour force.
The government's chief economic adviser, Arvind Subramanian, has warned against framing policies based on the recent revisions, which he branded ""mystifying"".
""I am puzzled by the new GDP growth numbers,"" he told the Business Standard newspaper last week.
While falling global oil prices, cooling inflation and interest rate cuts are expected to boost demand and improve the economic outlook, listless corporate spending and mounting bad loans at Indian banks remain a drag.
The central bank's monetary policy switched to a new easing cycle in January with its first interest rate cut in 20 months, while the rupee currency has been one of the best performers among Asian emerging markets, helped by a lower oil import bill.
""We may be reaching the outskirts of the woods but we are not out of the woods yet,"" RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan said last week. ""So I don't think any data that suggests we are out of the woods at this point, we would put too much weight on it."""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's trade performance slumped in January, with exports falling 3.3 percent from year-ago levels while imports tumbled 19.9 percent, far worse than analysts had expected and highlighting deepening weakness in the Chinese economy.
Largely as a result of the sharply lower imports - particularly of coal, oil and commodities - China posted a record monthly trade surplus of $60 billion.
The data contrasted sharply with a Reuters poll which showed analysts expected exports to gain 6.3 percent and the slowdown in imports to slow to 3 percent, following a better-than-expected showing in December. The poll had also forecast a trade surplus of $48.9 billion.
The slide in imports is the sharpest since May 2009, when Chinese factories were still slashing inventories in reaction to the global financial crisis. Exports have not produced a negative annual reading since March 2014.
The dismal trade performance will increase concerns that an economic slowdown in China - originally considered a desirable adjustment away from an investment-intensive export model toward one based on domestic consumption - is at risk of derailing. 
The government is expected to lower its GDP target to around 7 percent this year, after posting 7.4 percent in 2014 - the slowest pace in 24 years.
Chinese economic indicators in January and February are typically viewed with caution given the distortions caused by the shifting week-long Lunar New Year holiday, and while the analyst median estimate was for a rise, the range of estimates was extremely wide.
However the data - in particular the import data - is worrisome even after accounting for cyclical factors; last year the new year holiday idled factories and financial markets for a week in January, but this year the holiday comes in late February and January was a full month of business as usual.
""It's a very strange data print,"" said Andrew Polk, economist at the Conference Board in Beijing, noting that exports tended to be less effected by the holiday than other indicators, but added he was more concerned by the implications of the startlingly negative import figure.
""The import data suggests a substantial slowdown in the industrial sector. The first quarter looks to be pretty horrible."" 
Investors had hoped that the announcement of domestic stimulus spending plans, combined with moves to ease monetary policy, including a reduction in banks' reserve requirement ratios on Wednesday, would restore confidence and boost demand in China's struggling manufacturing sector. 
However, many analysts believe measures taken so far to boost yuan liquidity are insufficient to do much more than offset surging capital outflows. Advocates of more aggressive action will seize on the weak January trade data to support their case.
Chinese imports have fallen every month since October, seen as reflecting weak domestic demand, and the scale of January's drop was mostly due to an across-the-board fall in import volumes of major commodities.
For example, coal imports dropped nearly 40 percent to 16.78 million tonnes, down from December's 27.22 million tonnes, and China also appeared to cut back on its strategic stocking of crude oil imports, which slid by 7.9 percent in volume terms.
Imports from Australia and the Russian Federation, both major fuel and commodity suppliers, slid by 35.3 percent and 28.7 percent, respectively.
EUROPEAN HEADACHE
Chinese officials had predicted that monetary easing measures in Europe would boost demand for Chinese goods, and analysts polled by Reuters had also been optimistic that signs of economic strengthening in the United States would support exports.
However, the data showed that while exports to the United States rose by 4.8 percent year-on-year to $35 billion, exports to the European Union slid 4.6 percent to $33 billion in the same period.
Exports to Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan were also down, with exports to Japan slumping over 20 percent.
During 2014, China's total trade value increased by 3.4 percent from a year earlier, short of the official target of 7.5 percent, and some analysts have raised questions about whether export data was inflated by fake invoicing as firms speculated in the currency and commodities markets.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth rose solidly in January and wages rebounded, a show of economic strength that put a mid-year interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve back on the table.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 257,000 last month, the Labor Department said on Friday, outstripping Wall Street forecasts.
At the same time, data for November and December was revised to show a whopping 147,000 more jobs created than previously reported, bolstering views consumers will have enough muscle to carry the economy through rough global seas.
""A mid-year lift-off in the interest rate is fait accompli ... there was good news on many fronts,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo.
At 423,000, November's gain was the largest for any month since May 2010, when employment was boosted by government hiring for a national census. Over the past three months, more than one million jobs have been created, the first time that milestone has been reached since late 1997.
The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.7 percent, but that was because Americans poured into the labor force to hunt for work in a show of increased confidence.
The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell as investors brought forward bets on a rate hike. U.S. stocks ended lower amid concerns over Greece's debt negotiations.
Rate futures shifted to show traders now expect a rate increase in September. Before the report, they were anticipating an October hike. Some top Fed officials have been pointing to a June policy tightening.
A Reuters survey of Wall Street's largest banks published after the data showed most economists expect a June take-off.
""Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers were optimistic enough to start looking for work in January. Most Fed officials are likely to see this report as good reason to be nervous about potential economic overheating,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
WAGE GAINS QUICKEN
January marked the 11th straight month of job gains above 200,000, the longest streak since 1994.
Sputtering growth overseas and lower oil prices have weighed on U.S. exports and business investment, but the jobs report suggested the economy continued to be a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy world.
Wages increased 12 cents last month, the largest gain since June 2007, after falling five cents in December. That took the year-on-year gain to 2.2 percent, the fastest since August, but still below where Fed officials would like to see it.
The U.S. central bank, which has held benchmark borrowing costs near zero since December 2008, ramped up its assessment of the labor market last week, and economists said the jobs data raised the prospect it would push rates higher sooner, despite inflation running below its 2 percent target.
""Employment growth is clearly on fire and it's beginning to put upward pressure on wage growth,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""The Fed can't wait much longer in that environment.""
MASSIVE TAILWIND
The pick-up in wages is likely to combine with lower oil prices to provide a massive tailwind for consumer spending and keep the economy growing at a healthy clip.
In addition to the firmer wages and job growth, the labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, rose two-tenths of a percentage point to 62.9 percent.
The employment-to-population ratio rose to 59.3 percent, the highest since July 2009, from 59.2 percent in December.
But a broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment rose to 11.3 percent from 11.2 percent in December.
In January, private payrolls increased by 267,000, while November and December private employment was revised higher. Private payroll gains in November were the largest since September 1997.
The manufacturing sector added 22,000 jobs last month, while construction payrolls increased 39,000. Oil and gas extraction employment, however, fell 1,900, reflecting layoffs connected to lower oil prices.
Retail employment increased 45,900 after braking sharply in December. Government payrolls fell 10,000, while transportation employment dropped 8,600, the first decline since last February.
Temporary staffing slipped 4,100, the first drop in a year.
The average workweek was steady at 34.6 hours.

The inflation view eased to 1.25% for headline CPI by June 2015 from an earlier range in November of 1.50% to 2.50% - and well below the mid-point aim of the 2% to 3% target.
The forecasts also assumed the cash rate moves broadly in line with market pricing but the RBA cautioned that doing this ""doesn't represent a commitment by the board to any particular path for policy."" The last time the RBA used market pricing in its cash rate assumption forecast was in May 2011.The RBA said growth is expected to remain below trend over the course of 2015 and then to pick up to an above-trend pace in the latter part of the forecast period, in response to rapid growth in LNG exports and the lower exchange rate and interest rates.For the summary of the statement, see below.""Prior to the February Board meeting, the cash rate had been at the same level since August 2013. Interest rates faced by households and firms had declined a little over this period. Very low interest rates have contributed to a pick-up in the growth of non-mining activity.""""The recent large fall in oil prices, if sustained, will also help to bolster domestic demand. However, over recent months there have been fewer indications of a near-term strengthening in growth than previous forecasts would have implied. Hence, growth overall is now forecast to remain at a below-trend pace somewhat longer than had earlier been expected.""""Accordingly, the economy is expected to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet, and domestic cost pressures are likely to remain subdued and inflation well contained. In addition, while the exchange rate has depreciated, it remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant falls in key commodity prices, and so is providing less assistance in delivering balanced growth in the economy than it could.""""Given this assessment, and informed by a set of forecasts based on an unchanged cash rate, the Board judged at its February meeting that a further 25 basis point reduction in the cash rate was appropriate. This decision is expected to provide some additional support to demand, thus fostering sustainable growth and inflation outcomes consistent with the inflation target."""
821,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2015 11:13AM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit widens; weekly jobless claims up modestly,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit in December widened sharply to its highest level since 2012 as a stronger dollar appeared to suck in imports and weigh on exports, which could see the fourth-quarter economic growth estimate revised lower.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit jumped 17.1 percent to $46.6 billion, the largest since November 2012. It was the biggest percentage increase since July 2009 and also reflected a sputtering global economy.
""It is not hard to come up with reasons for the weakness in today's report - sluggish foreign growth and a strong dollar are the obvious ones,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. 
Wall Street had expected the trade gap to narrow to $38 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit widened to $54.7 billion from $48.7 billion in November. 
December's shortfall was wider than the government had assumed when it reported last week that gross domestic product had expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Trade was estimated to have subtracted 1.02 percentage point from GDP growth.
Economists said it now appeared the drag on growth was bigger and they expect the government to lower the fourth-quarter growth estimate by as much as four-tenths of a percentage point when it publishes revisions later this month.
On an inflation-adjusted trade-weighted basis, the dollar appreciated 5.3 percent last year. 
While trade is on the back foot, the labor market is weathering the strong dollar and the global slowdown.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Jan. 31, the Labor Department said in a separate report.
The increase, which was less than economists' expectations for a rise to 290,000, left intact the bulk of the prior week's huge decline, which had taken claims to their lowest level since April 2000. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell.
FIRMING LABOR MARKET
January's employment report to be released on Friday will likely show that nonfarm payrolls increased 234,000, according to a Reuters survey of economists, which would be the longest stretch of job gains above 200,000 since 1994. 
A firming labor market, together with lower gasoline prices, is seen bolstering consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth in early 2015. 
""We still believe the U.S. can remain an oasis of prosperity in the world even if international developments are starting to intrude a little on our buoyant forecasts for 2015,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
In a sign of the consumer-driven strengthening in domestic demand, imports rose 2.2 percent to $241.4 billion in December. The increase was in part due to a jump in petroleum imports, which hit their highest level since May 2013. 
The higher petroleum imports probably found their way into wholesale inventories and could prove temporary.
""We suspect ... storage plays by domestic oil market participants, with a large number of oil investors racing to buy crude at lower prices and storing it amid contango plays,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
Imports of non-petroleum products surged to a record high, also reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar.
But with the dollar's rise, exports slipped 0.8 percent to $194.9 billion in December, an eight-month low. 
A range of companies, including Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), the world's largest household products maker, and Microsoft Corp (O:MSFT) have warned that the dollar was hurting profits. 
Exports have been hurt by a labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which has been cited by some manufacturers as causing delays in the movement of goods.
Exports to Canada and Mexico - the main U.S. trading partners - fell in December. In contrast, exports to Japan, China and the European Union rose in December.

The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 5.5 percent to $28.3 billion.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit jumped 17.1 percent to $46.6 billion, the largest since November 2012. It was the biggest percentage increase since July 2009.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit falling to $38.0 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit widened to $54.7 billion from $48.7 billion in November.
December's surprise surge in the trade gap suggested a downward revision to the fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate. The government reported last week that GDP expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate, with trade estimated to have subtracted 1.02 percentage point from growth.
In December, imports rose 2.2 percent to $241.4 billion, with imports of non-petroleum products surging to a record high, a sign of strengthening in the domestic economy. It also reflected the strength of the U.S. dollar.

Exports slipped 0.8 percent to $194.9 billion in December. Exports have been hurt by slowing growth in Asia and Europe, a strengthening dollar, as well as a labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which has been cited by some manufacturers as causing delays in the movement of goods.
Exports to Canada and Mexico - the main U.S. trading partners - fell in December. In contrast, exports to Japan, China and the European Union rose in December.
The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 5.5 percent to $28.3 billion.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2015 08:50AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims rise less than expected,"The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment rose less than expected last week, a sign that the labor market continues to strengthen.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Jan. 31, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
The increase left intact the bulk of the prior week's huge decline, which had taken claims to their lowest level since April 2000. Claims for the week ended Jan. 24 were revised to show 2,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists had forecast claims rising to 290,000 last week.
Claims have been volatile in recent months because of difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal variations. Still, they have continued to point to a firming labor market.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 6,500 to 292,750 last week.

Last week's data has no bearing on Friday's employment report for January as it falls outside the survey period.
Nonfarm payrolls likely increased 234,000 after rising 252,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey of economists, which would be the longest stretch of job gains above 200,000 since 1994.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid edged up 6,000 to 2.40 million in the week ended Jan. 24."

Financial data firm Markit said the final reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the service sector rose to 54.2 in January, up from both the preliminary read of 54.0, as well as the December read of 53.3, which had matched a 10-month low.
The January figure broke a six-month streak of waning growth, having peaked in June with a reading of 61. A reading above 50 separates expansion from contraction.
The report follows a read on the manufacturing sector that showed growth holding at the slowest rate in a year's time.
The new business subindex fell to 51.7, and while this was moderately stronger than the preliminary read of 51.4, it ranks as the lowest reading in the history of the Markit services sector series, which dates from October 2009. December's level was 52.9.
""Companies are clearly struggling at the moment, with the surveys recording the smallest increase in new orders seen since the financial crisis six years ago amid weaker US and global economic growth and the strong US dollar,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.
""However, the survey also found that companies remained in hiring mode, pointing to another robust non-farm payroll gain in January. At the same time, cost pressures hit a post-crisis low due to the oil price rout, which should pave the way for further falls in headline inflation in coming months.""
Growth in the employment subindex accelerated in January after slowing in December.

Markit's composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, edged up to 54.4 in January from 53.5 in December. The preliminary January read was 54.2.

(Reuters) - The euro zone private sector grew at its fastest pace in six months in January as firms slashed prices at the steepest rate in nearly five years, a business survey showed on Wednesday.
Data compiler Markit said the survey, carried out mostly before the European Central Bank announced a near-trillion euro quantitative easing program to revive inflation and boost the economy, pointed to first-quarter growth of 0.3 percent.
That matches the median forecast in a Reuters poll last month and, if realized, would be faster than the 0.1 percent economists have penciled in for the end of 2014.
Markit's final January Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good indicator of growth, stood at 52.6, higher than a preliminary estimate of 52.2 and December's 51.4.
""The euro zone enjoyed a positive start to 2015, as growth of economic activity accelerated. Among the big-four nations, output expanded in Germany, Italy and Spain, but the downturn in the French economy extended into its ninth month,"" Markit said.
However, that growth came at a cost to margins. An index measuring output prices fell to 46.9 from December's 48.1, its lowest reading since February 2010, suggesting firms were slashing prices to drum up trade.
Prices dropped a record-equaling 0.6 percent last month as commodity prices, Brent crude in particular, tumbled.
Price-cutting helped drive service industry activity up at the fastest rate in five months. The services sector PMI rose to 52.7 from December's 51.6, ahead of the flash 52.3 estimate.
Confidence about the ECB's QE program and signs of growth in new orders accelerating helped lift a gauge of optimism among service firms by the biggest one-month margin in over five years, to 63.9 from 59.7."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. factory goods fell for a fifth straight month in December, but a smaller-than-previously reported drop in business spending plans supported views of a rebound in the months ahead.
Other data on Tuesday showing fairly brisk sales in January by the country's leading automobile manufactures also offered a silver lining for a sector that has taken a hit from weak global demand and falling crude oil prices.
""It suggests that activity will pick up in coming months,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
The Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods declined 3.4 percent as demand fell across a broad sector of industries. That followed a 1.7 percent decrease in November and exceeded economists expectations for a 2.2 percent drop.
The department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - slipped only 0.1 percent instead of the 0.6 percent drop reported last month.
Manufacturing is being constrained by weakening demand in Europe and Asia, as well as a strong dollar and falling crude oil prices, which have caused some companies in the energy sector to either delay or cut back on capital expenditure projects. 
An ongoing labor dispute at the nation's West Coast ports, which has caused shipment delays, is also hurting activity. 
Business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter was the weakest since mid-2009, helping to hold back the economy to a 2.6 percent annual growth pace.
In a sign of weakness, unfilled orders at factories slipped 0.8 percent in December, the first fall in 10 months. 
The soft trend in business investment likely persisted early into the first quarter, with a report on Monday showing a manufacturing sector gauge falling in January.
But there is cautious optimism that firming domestic demand will limit the slowdown in manufacturing.
Auto sales increased 13.7 percent in January from a year ago to a annual rate of 16.66 million units. General Motors (N:GM) reported an 18 percent jump in sales, while Ford (N:F) said sales rose 15 percent. Sales at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) gained 14 percent.
There was some good news in the factory orders report.
Shipments of non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, were revised up to show a 0.2 percent gain in December instead of a 0.2 percent fall. 
Economists said that suggested capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was probably not as weak as initially thought.
Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan, said real equipment spending now looks to have declined at a annual rate of 1.3 percent rather than the 1.9 percent pace the government reported last week.
""Oil and gas industries appear to be only partially responsible for the recent weakness in the data, and it is likely that the stronger dollar and weaker growth abroad are also weighing on activity,"" said Silver.
But any boost to GDP growth from more shipments of these so-called core capital goods orders was likely to be offset by a 0.3 percent fall in manufacturing inventories.
The first decline in factory stocks in 18 months suggested the contribution to growth in the fourth quarter from inventory accumulation could be lowered by as much as three-tenths of a percentage point, economists said.

867,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 03, 2015 02:15AM ET</span>","India's Central Bank Holds Rates, Says Tracking Inflation And Fiscal Action","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) held interest rates steady at 7.75 percent on Tuesday after easing monetary policy just three weeks ago, leaving its next move probably until after the government presents its annual budget at the end of this month.
Instead, the central bank cut the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) - or the amount of bonds that lenders must set aside - by 50 basis points to 21.5 percent of deposits from Feb. 7, prodding banks to increase lending.
""Banks should use this headroom to increase their lending to productive sectors on competitive terms so as to support investment and growth,"" the RBI said in a statement.
The RBI also announced a slew of initiatives to develop markets, including allowing foreign institutional investors to re-invest government bond coupons even when their investment limits are exhausted.
Most economists polled by Reuters had expected the RBI to keep its repo policy rate steady, and reduce rates later so long as the budget, due to be unveiled by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Feb. 28, does not disappoint in terms of reducing the fiscal deficit.
The RBI said in its statement that it wanted more comfort that inflation would continue to ease and that it would await action from the government regarding the country's finances.
""Given that there have been no substantial new developments on the disinflationary process or on the fiscal outlook since January 15, it is appropriate for the Reserve Bank to await them and maintain the current interest stance,"" the central bank said.
Comforted by falling world oil prices and inflation slowing, the RBI had surprised investors with 25 basis points cut in the repo rate on Jan. 15, even though investors were expecting the central bank to embark on an easing cycle at some point during the early months of the year.
The RBI clearly saw little point in waiting any longer to reduce borrowing costs in an economy that was struggling to gather momentum.
Markets are pricing in more interest rate cuts over the rest of the year given inflation is expected to remain subdued on the back of a plunge in global crude prices and bigger-than-expected falls in domestic vegetable and fruit prices.
Consumer prices rose 5 percent in December, well within the RBI target of 6 percent by January 2016."
868,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 03, 2015 02:15AM ET</span>","Australia's RBA Cuts Rates To Record Low, Market Hankers For More","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Australia's central bank cut its cash rate to an all-time trough of 2.25 percent on Tuesday, breaking an 18-month hiatus on stimulus as it seeks to spur a sluggish economy while keeping downward pressure on the local dollar.
The currency duly sank more than a full U.S. cent after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) ended its first policy meeting of the year by announcing the quarter point cut.
""Overall, the Bank's assessment is that output growth will probably remain a little below trend for somewhat longer, and the rate of unemployment peak a little higher, than earlier expected,"" said RBA Governor Glenn Stevens in a brief statement.
""This action is expected to add some further support to demand, so as to foster sustainable growth and inflation outcomes consistent with the target.""
Markets had been leaning toward a cut this week, though only 9 of 29 analysts in a Reuters poll had tipped a move.
Interbank futures jumped on the news while pricing in a near 50-50 probability of a further move to 2.00 percent at the next policy meeting in March.
Yields on 10-year government debt had already been trading below the cash rate and dropped further to a record low of 2.36 percent, while Australian stocks hit their highest since 2008.
""It's very clear their assessment of the outlook for activity is weaker,"" said Su-Lin Ong, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets, adding that the RBA was now likely to trim forecasts for growth and inflation in its quarterly statement on monetary policy due out on Feb. 6.
""We have rates at 2 percent and the risk is that it heads lower,"" said Ong. ""We are stuck in this sub-par period of growth for a long time.""
LOWER A$ NEEDED
It was the RBA's first easing since August 2013 and marked a sharp turnaround from its previous meeting in December when it had signaled a period of stability for policy.
The move was partly aimed at offsetting painful price declines for many of Australia's resource exports which are hurting both company profits and mining investment.
The situation has been made all the tougher by a protracted slowdown in China, Australia's biggest export market.
The move was given extra urgency by the recent rush to ease by other central banks meant the RBA had to follow suit if only to stop its currency from rising to uncompetitive levels.
Indeed, Stevens cautioned that ""a lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy."" The local dollar obliged by falling over a cent to $0.7670.
The outlook for domestic inflation had also moderated as petrol prices plunged and wage growth stayed stuck at decade lows. Core inflation is now expected to hold near the floor of the RBA's 2-3 percent target band for much of this year.
An added wrinkle is political uncertainty as speculation swirls around the future of Prime Minister Tony Abbott.
A bruising voter backlash in state elections and a slump in his personal approval ratings has sparked chatter of a party revolt against his leadership.
Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 share index surged to its highest level in almost seven years after the RBA cut.
The index extended gains, adding 1.2 percent to an intra-day peak of 5,692.7 points, its highest since May 2008."

China's growth was in line with policymakers' objectives. The US economy continued to strengthen, but the euro area and Japanese economies were both weaker than expected. Forecasts for global growth in 2015 envisage continued moderate growth.Commodity prices have continued to decline, in some cases sharply. The price of oil in particular has fallen significantly over the past few months. These trends appear to reflect a combination of lower growth in demand and, more importantly, significant increases in supply. The much lower levels of energy prices will act to strengthen global output and temporarily to lower CPI inflation rates.Financial conditions are very accommodative globally, with long-term borrowing rates for several major sovereigns reaching new all-time lows over recent months. Some risk spreads have widened a little but overall financing costs for creditworthy borrowers remain remarkably low.In Australia the available information suggests that growth is continuing at a below-trend pace, with domestic demand growth overall quite weak. As a result, the unemployment rate has gradually moved higher over the past year. The fall in energy prices can be expected to offer significant support to consumer spending, but at the same time the decline in the terms of trade is reducing income growth. Overall, the Bank's assessment is that output growth will probably remain a little below trend for somewhat longer, and the rate of unemployment peak a little higher, than earlier expected. The economy is likely to be operating with a degree of spare capacity for some time yet.The CPI recorded the lowest increase for several years in 2014. This was affected by the sharp decline in oil prices at the end of the year and the removal of the price on carbon. Measures of underlying inflation also declined a little, to around 2¼ per cent over the year. With growth in labour costs subdued, it appears likely that inflation will remain consistent with the target over the next one to two years, even with a lower exchange rate.Credit growth picked up to moderate rates in 2014, with stronger growth in lending to investors in housing assets. Dwelling prices have continued to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities over recent months. The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain economic risks that may arise from the housing market.The Australian dollar has declined noticeably against a rising US dollar over recent months, though less so against a basket of currencies. It remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices. A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy.For the past year and a half, the cash rate has been stable, as the Board has taken time to assess the effects of the substantial easing in policy that had already been put in place and monitored developments in Australia and abroad. At today's meeting, taking into account the flow of recent information and updated forecasts, the Board judged that, on balance, a further reduction in the cash rate was appropriate. This action is expected to add some further support to demand, so as to foster sustainable growth and inflation outcomes consistent with the target.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending recorded its biggest decline since late 2009 in December with households saving the extra cash from cheaper gasoline. 
Other data on Monday showed factory activity cooled in January, suggesting the economy may have entered the new year on a slightly softer footing than had been expected.
Nevertheless, upbeat and cash-flush consumers are expected to step-up spending and buoy the economy this year. 
""The consumer is poised to do well in early 2015. Lower gasoline prices are going to provide a big lift to consumption,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 0.3 percent after gaining 0.5 percent in November and 0.3 percent in October.
The drop, the largest since September 2009, reflected a decline in spending at service stations as gasoline prices fell, as well as weak auto receipts and weather-related softness in demand for utilities. 
The spending data was included in Friday's fourth-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed the economy growing at a 2.6 percent annual pace, with consumer spending rising at a brisk 4.3 percent rate - the fastest since 2006.
Economists said fourth-quarter GDP growth is likely to be revised up to at least a 2.8 percent rate after another Commerce Department report on Tuesday showed stronger nonresidential construction spending in December than previously assumed.
Despite ending 2014 on a weak note, lower gasoline prices - which have dropped 43 percent since June - and a firming labor market are seen providing a huge tailwind to consumer spending in the first quarter. 
Consumer spending estimates for the first quarter are currently ranging between a 4 percent to 5 percent rate.
In a separate report the Institute for Supply Management said its national factory activity index fell to 53.5 last month from 55.1 in December. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector and the drop reflected a fall in export orders, as well as order backlogs, which could be related to slowing growth overseas and weak demand for energy industry-related equipment.
Business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter was the weakest since mid-2009. 
Still, 14 of 18 industries reported a pick-up in activity last month, up from 11 in the prior month. 
Another report from financial data firm Markit showed its U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index was at 53.9 in January, the same as in December.
STILL HOPEFUL 
""There is hope that the manufacturing sector recovery is not falling out of bed entirely,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
U.S. stocks were trading slightly higher, while the dollar weakened against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell.
In another good omen for consumer spending, income at the disposal of households after inflation recorded its largest gain since last March, while the saving rate hit a five-month high. 
With gasoline prices trending lower, key inflation gauges slipped further below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target in December. A price index for consumer spending fell 0.2 percent for a second month.
In the 12 months through December, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 0.7 percent, the weakest reading since October 2009, slowing from a 1.2 percent increase in November.
Excluding food and energy, prices were unchanged for a second straight month. The so-called core PCE price index increased 1.3 percent in the 12 months through December, the smallest gain since March.
The Fed has repeatedly said it viewed the oil-driven decline in inflation as transitory and expected inflation to move back to its target.
""The concern is that falling oil prices combined with a strong dollar, which pushes down the price of imports, could move inflation even lower, which could dampen overall economic activity,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.

""Outright deflation seems unlikely, especially in light of better labor market conditions.""

877,By International Business Times,"<span>Feb 02, 2015 07:31AM ET</span>",Exports Boost UK Manufacturing In January As Factories Cut Prices,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - British manufacturing grew slightly faster in January thanks in part to a modest recovery in export orders, and trimmed prices as raw material costs fell at their quickest rate since May 2009, a survey showed on Monday.
Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.0 from an upwardly revised 52.7 in December, beating a Reuters poll forecast for 52.6 and holding comfortably above the 50 mark that signals growth.
Overall, the survey suggested British factories will provide a modest contribution to Britain's economic recovery, but that consumers and the much larger services sector will be a more powerful driver of the upturn.
Sterling fell against the dollar and euro following Monday's survey, despite showing an improvement, as investors focused more on international themes like global disinflation.
The PMI suggested manufacturing output is rising at a quarterly pace of around 0.2 percent, according to survey compiler Markit, only a slight improvement on the 0.1 percent growth seen in the last three months of 2014.
""The domestic market remains a key driver of growth, but bucking recent trends, there was also a modest increase in demand from overseas,"" said Lee Hopley, chief economist at the EEF manufacturing trade association.
""However, we will need to see this sustained in the coming months before we can call it a turnaround in the sector's export performance.""
Despite expanding last year at the fastest annual pace since 2007, Britain's economy grew more slowly than expected in the final three months of the year, and the government will be keen to avoid signs of a further slowdown ahead of a May 7 national election.
British manufacturing output is still around 5.3 percent below its pre-downturn peak in early 2008.
Orders from both home and abroad came in faster last month, the PMI showed, with the new export orders index hitting a five-month high.
With oil prices more than halving over the last six months to below $50 a barrel, prices paid by manufacturers for raw materials fell at the fastest rate since May 2009, with this part of the index tumbling to 40.1 from 46.3, one of the sharpest declines on record.
Producers cut prices charged to customers much more modestly, though this was still their first price cut in 19 months and the biggest since September 2009.
""The scale of these disinflationary pressures makes us more certain that CPI inflation will spend a good portion of this year in negative territory,"" said Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to forecasting group EY Item Club.
British consumer price inflation plunged to its lowest level since May 2000 in December and BoE Governor Mark Carney has said it is likely to turn negative in the months ahead.
""Given the (BoE's) concerns that low inflation could become entrenched, results like these make it highly likely that interest rates will stay at 0.5 percent throughout this year,"" Beck added."
878,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2015 06:42AM ET</span>","Deflation alarms ring louder as EU, Chinese factories struggle","By Jonathan Cable and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - European and Chinese factories slashed prices in January as production flatlined, heightening global deflation risks that point to another wave of central bank stimulus in the coming year.
While the pulse of activity was livelier in other parts of Asia - Japan, India and South Korea - they too shared a common condition of slowing inflation.
Central banks from Switzerland to Turkey via Canada and Singapore have already loosened monetary policy in the past few weeks.
The European Central Bank also announced a near-trillion-euro quantitative easing program in a bid to revive inflation and drive up growth, though much of the bloc's Purchasing Managers' Index survey was collated before that announcement.
""There are a lot of places where central banks are focusing on easing rather than anything else. In the euro zone the ECB is going all-out now,"" said Jacqui Douglas, senior global strategist at TD Securities.
""Looking at the rest of Europe we are expecting more easing from Sweden and Norway, that is where most central banks are leaning right now. There is no real rush to move ahead with rate hikes.""
Markit's final PMI reading for the euro zone, published on Monday, was 51.0, in line with the flash estimate. Although at a six-month high, it was only just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. In December the index came in at 50.6.
Worryingly for policymakers, firms cut prices in January at the steepest rate since mid-2013. Data on Friday showed annual inflation was a record-equaling low of -0.6 percent in January across the 19 nations using the euro.
In Britain, manufacturing grew slightly faster but factories cut prices at the fastest pace since 2009. The Bank of England will keep interest rates at a record low until at least October, later than previously thought, a Reuters poll found last week. [GB/PMIM] [BOE/INT]
""With oil prices having stabilized at around $45 per barrel now, it seems likely that lower oil prices should continue to enable manufacturers to lower prices and so support demand,"" said Paul Hollingsworth at Capital Economics.
Still to come later on Monday is a sister manufacturing survey from Markit covering the United States, as well as the Institute for Supply Management's U.S. factory index, which is forecast to have slipped to 54.5 in January from 55.1. 
EASING CHINA?
Earlier, a pair of surveys from China showed manufacturing struggling at the start of 2015 in the world's second biggest economy.
The Chinese HSBC/Markit PMI inched up a fraction to 49.7. But of more concern the official PMI, which is biased towards large factories, unexpectedly showed activity shrank for the first time in nearly 2-1/2 years.
The reading of 49.8 in January was down from December's 50.1 and missed a median forecast of 50.2. The report showed input costs sliding at their fastest rate since March 2009, with lower prices for oil and steel playing major roles.
Ordinarily, cheaper energy prices would be good for China, one of the world's most intensive energy consumers, but many economists believe the phenomenon is a net negative for Chinese firms because of its impact on demand.
The PMIs only fueled bets on a weaker yuan and that more monetary easing was in store in Beijing too.
""China still needs decent growth to add 100 million new jobs this year, plus China is entering a rapid disinflation process,"" ANZ economists said in a note to clients.
""We (think) the People's Bank of China will cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and cut the deposit rate by 25 basis points in the first quarter.""
The downdraft has also spread into China's hitherto buoyant services sector, the lone bright spot in the economy last year. Service activity expanded at its lowest level in a year.
Slightly better news came from Japan, where the central bank has been pursuing an aggressive bond-buying campaign for over a year in a bid to revive growth and shake the country out of decades of deflation.
The final Markit/JMMA PMI edged up in January as the sustained weakness of the yen drove up exports. Improving exports were also a feature of South Korea's PMI which returned to growth for the first time in five months.

India's manufacturing activity continued to grow, though the headline index eased a touch but importantly for the prospect of more policy stimulus, cost pressures were the mildest in 70 months as commodity prices fell.

(Reuters) - Euro zone factory activity grew slightly last month as companies kept slashing prices, but a weakened currency did little to help drive new orders from abroad, a survey showed on Monday.
""Euro zone manufacturing showed signs of pulling out of the doldrums at the start of the year, but the rate of expansion remained disappointingly meager, vindicating the ECB's decision to take drastic action,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
The survey's results were mostly collected before the European Central Bank announced a near-trillion euro quantitative easing program as part of its bid to revive inflation and drive up growth.
Markit's final January manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was 51.0, in line with an earlier flash reading.
Although it was a six-month high, it was only just above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. In December the index came in at 50.6.
Firms cut prices in January at the steepest rate since mid-2013. Data on Friday showed prices fell at a record-equaling 0.6 percent across the 19 nations using the euro in January.
The euro has fallen more than 6 percent so far EUR/USD this year, which will make the bloc's goods cheaper to outsiders, but new export orders in January picked up at a weaker pace than in December. An export orders subindex, which includes orders between countries within the currency union, stood at 50.7, in line with the flash reading but well below December's 51.6.
Earlier data from Germany, Europe's biggest economy, showed factory growth was slower than previously thought there. In France, the bloc's second biggest economy, activity shrank for the ninth month."

(Reuters) - Activity in China's factory sector shrank for the second straight month in January, a private business survey showed on Monday, as the new year got off to a rocky start for the world's second-largest economy.
The slack performance, including a 15th month of shrinking factory employment, will add to the debate over how and whether Beijing will accelerate policy easing, with most bank economists calling for a combination of rate cuts and increased liquidity to spur productive investment.
The final HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for January came in at 49.7 on a seasonally adjusted basis, just below the 50.0 level that separates growth from contraction. The number was slightly lower than a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 49.8 but higher than the final 49.6 in December.
""Demand in the manufacturing sector remains weak and more aggressive monetary and fiscal easing measures will be needed to prevent another sharp slowdown in growth,"" said Hongbin Qu, China chief economist at HSBC.
The dour data mirrored two official reports released by the government on Sunday which showed weakness in China's manufacturing and services sectors last month.
The official PMI - which is biased towards large Chinese factories - unexpectedly showed manufacturing activity shrank for the first time in nearly 2-1/2 years and firms saw more gloom ahead.
""We think targeted measures remain the first policy option,"" said Tim Condon at ING.
""The November policy rate cut was preceded by complaints by Premier Li about the lack of credit flow to businesses and we will be looking for similar hints to gauge the likelihood of a bazooka stimulus,"" he said, adding that he didn't consider the sub-50 official reading particularly surprising given seasonal factors and wider economic trends.
In the private survey, there was marginal expansion in new orders and new export orders, though both were revised downward from the earlier ""flash"" estimates.
Jobs shrank for the 15th consecutive month, but the rate slowed, with the subindex reading at 49.5 in January compared to 49.3 in December.
The slide is keeping pressure on Beijing to increase the pace at which workers migrate into services from once high-paying factory jobs, a challenging proposition given weak investment in retraining.
More worrisome was the sharp slide in input costs, which fell at their steepest rate since March 2009, with lower prices for oil and steel playing major roles in the decline.
Ordinarily, cheaper energy prices would be good for China, one of the world's most intensive energy consumers, but most economists believe the phenomenon is a net negative for Chinese firms because of its impact on ultimate demand.

Not all of Monday's PMI report was bad. Output recovered for the first time since October, although only marginally, with muted demand keeping a lid on it.

896,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2015 04:20AM ET</span>",Fed's 'solid' growth view faces test as Greek drama unfolds,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's upgraded view that growth in the world's biggest economy is ""solid"", and so capable of withstanding an interest rate rise this year, will be put to the test by U.S. jobs data this week.
Ructions over Greece's new anti-austerity government will also continue to grip markets, and could overshadow economic data in the coming days.
The Federal Reserve last week lifted its assessment of the U.S. expansion to ""solid"" from ""moderate"", with jobs growth now seen as ""strong"". 
A Reuters poll forecasts that U.S. employment data on Friday will show about 230,000 jobs were created in January, slowing slightly from 252,000 in December but still robust.
If confirmed it would be 12th consecutive month of payroll increases above 200,000, the longest such stretch since a 13-month run in 1994-95.
""Interest rates then were 6 percent. It simply isn't a zero percent environment at the moment,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit.
Weak wage growth has dented some of the optimism created by strong job creation. 
Average wages fell 0.2 percent in December, the biggest decline in at least eight years, although some economists said that may have been a seasonal fluke, and the consensus is for a 0.3 percent increase in January. 
In an encouraging sign, the more widely respected Employment Cost Index, released on Friday, showed labour costs increased by 2.2 percent in the 12 months through December, although still below the 3 percent economists say is needed to bring inflation close to the Fed's 2 percent target. 
Fed officials have indicated that interest rates could rise as soon as in June, though futures contracts indicate investors expect a first move in September. The target rate has been close to zero since late 2008.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has repeatedly said the decision will be data-dependent. U.S. economic growth cooled in the fourth quarter of last year but consumer sentiment hit an 11-year high, data showed on Friday. 
Institute for Supply Management reports on Monday and Wednesday and consumer spending data on Monday will provide further pointers next week.
GREEK WRESTLING
In an addition to its post-meeting statement last week, the Fed said its assessment of interest rates would also take into account ""international developments"".
Bernd Weidensteiner, U.S. economy specialist at Commerzbank, said non-U.S. events would not change the general course of U.S. monetary policy but could affect the timing.
""The U.S. is still a relatively closed economy. The economic cycle is made in America,"" he said. ""But if, say, something awful happened with Greece, it would affect U.S. markets."" 
For the struggling euro zone, December retail sales and Markit's final purchasing managers' surveys (PMIs) will give the latest indications on the economy.
Retail sales, due on Wednesday, are seen rising 2 percent year-on-year, reinforcing an improvement in sentiment among consumers and retailers in an EU report last week; while manufacturing PMIs on Monday and services PMIs on Wednesday should confirm the initial view that European firms began 2015 with a little more bounce. 
However, with Greece's new left-wing government flatly rejecting on Friday the expected extension of its bailout programme, and Germany saying fresh Greek aid was not on the agenda, economic news may take second place to politics as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras visits other European leaders. 
""It could of course turn out to be a week dominated by politics, with what the new Greek government or Germany has to say,"" said James Knightley, senior economist at ING.
Official manufacturing PMIs from China on Monday will show how the world's second-biggest economy started the year, with forecasts pointing to factory growth inching up in January from a 1-1/2 year low, although the bounce is not expected to last due to unsteady exports and slowing investment.
Elsewhere, the Bank of England is seen keeping interest rates at a record low 0.5 percent on Thursday, with markets not expecting a rise until the fourth quarter, according to a Reuters poll.
By contrast, Australia's central bank, which meets on Tuesday, is seen more as a rate cutter, following the cue of commodity-rich Canada's unexpected rate reduction last month. 

However, higher-than-expected core inflation in Australia late last year has led investors to push back expectations for a cut to March, and not at next week's meeting as some economists had previously expected.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2015 12:00AM ET</span>",China factory sector jolts by shrinking in January ,"By Koh Gui Qing
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory sector unexpectedly shrank for the first time in nearly 2-1/2 years in January and firms see more gloom ahead, an official survey showed, raising expectations that policymakers will take more action to forestall a sharper slowdown.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.8 in January, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Sunday, a low last seen in September 2012 and a whisker below the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The December level was 50.1, and a Reuters poll saw a better result, 50.2 for January. Only one of 11 economists in the poll predicted a January contraction.
Most of the PMI indexes ""showed a downward trend, indicating that current economic growth is still in a downtrend,"" said Zhang Liqun, an economist at the Development Research Center, a state think-tank.
Some economists said the January reading was especially downbeat as it suggested that factories did not enjoy a usual spike in business before China's annual Spring Festival holiday, which falls in mid-February this year.
The poor January official PMI fueled bets that more monetary policy loosening was in store in the world's second-largest economy.
""China still needs decent growth to add 100 million new jobs this year, plus China is entering a rapid disinflation process,"" ANZ economists said in a note to clients.
""We (think) the People's Bank of China will cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and cut the deposit rate by 25 basis points in the first quarter,"" they said.
Marred by a housing slump, erratic growth in exports and a state-led slowdown in investment, China's economy has steadily lost steam in the last year as growth sunk to a 24-year low of 7.4 percent.
COOLING SERVICES
And the downturn has also broadened into the country's burgeoning services sector.
A separate official services PMI, also released on Sunday, showed growth in the sector cooled to a one-year low in January.
The official non-manufacturing PMI fell to 53.7, the lowest level since January 2014, from December's 54.1.
Accounting for 48 percent of China's $10.2 trillion economy last year, the services sector has weathered the growth downturn better than factories, partly because it depends less on foreign demand.
To revive demand, China's central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates in November after unveiling a stream of stimulus measures.
But despite the steady policy support, analysts polled by Reuters in January still expect economic growth to sag further this year to around 7 percent.
In the January factory PMI, all but one of the sub-indices in the PMI fell from December, indicating entrenched weakness.
Business expectations fell to 48.7, its lowest since records for that began in January 2013, while factory employment dropped to its lowest in nearly a year at 48.1, compared with the previous month's 47.9.
DROP IN NEW EXPORT ORDERS
New export orders, a proxy for the trade industry, fell to 48.4, from 49.1 in December.
In line with recent trends, the factory PMI showed the smallest manufacturers which are often privately-owned were the worst hit.
The official PMI looks more at larger, state-owned firms that a private one by HSBC/Markit, but it includes small factories, which in January was 46.4, versus 50.3 for large manufacturers that are mostly government run.
The HSBC/Markit final January PMI will be released on Monday. Its flash reading was 49.8, compared with 49.6 for December.
Underscoring the challenges faced, data last week showed China's factory profits grew at their weakest rate in two years in 2014.
China's industrial ministry said last week that it would aim to grow the manufacturing sector by 8 percent this year, down from last year's actual expansion of 8.3 percent.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2015 09:01AM ET</span>",Energy may see further weakness as key names report,"By Ryan Vlastelica
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock prices in the U.S. energy sector have been under pressure in 2015, and there could be more bad news to come when several key players report their fourth-quarter results next week. 
The group has been falling alongside crude oil prices, which are down about 60 percent since June. That drop has led to not only weaker shares - the S&P Energy index <.SPNY> is one of the worst-performing groups of 2015, and it was last year's worst - but also sharply lower earnings estimates for both the current quarter and the full year.
To be sure, some see long-term strength in the sector, and energy names are among the most undervalued in the S&P 500 per StarMine's measurement of intrinsic value, which looks at anticipated growth over the next decade. 
But in the near-term, many analysts feel the earnings revisions have not been severe enough, and that the bar, while lower, is still too high for companies to clear. Further disappointments could lead to continued weakness in the group. 
Energy company earnings are seen tumbling 25 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, a bigger decline than the drop of 19.8 percent forecast at the start of the year. For the full year, earnings are seen down almost 45 percent, nearly twice the decline of 23.3 percent forecast on Jan. 1.
Nick Sargen, chief economist at Fort Washington Investment Advisors in Cincinnati, said it was common for earnings worries to be assuaged as companies beat the lowered expectations, ""but this time, we're getting validation of those worries.""
The weakness in oil contributed to Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) missing profit forecasts by more than 20 percent this week. While some companies did top adjusted earnings forecasts, including ConocoPhillips (N:COP) and Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY), both companies slashed their 2015 exploration spending plans, a bearish signal about future growth prospects. 
Heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc (N:CAT) also reported disappointing results this week, with oil's weakness weighing on its energy equipment division.
""In the past, we would have nervousness followed by a sigh of relief. This quarter I'm less sure we'll get that sigh,"" said Sargen, who helps oversee about $48 billion in assets.
Oil's decline is seen as a positive for other sectors, and cheap gas prices contributed to strong recent readings of consumer sentiment. Since Jan. 1, earnings growth expectations for the S&P 500 overall have risen to 4.7 percent, from 4.2 percent. 
The big name reporting next week is Exxon Mobil Corp (N:XOM). Since Jan. 21, seven of the 18 analysts with an earnings forecast for Exxon have revised estimates, according to StarMine, with forecasts dropping by an average of 5.5 percent. Two of three analysts with revenue outlooks have changed their views, with estimates falling 7.3 percent on average.
Anadarko Petroleum (N:APC), which also reports next week, has seen similar cuts to forecasts, with 23 of the 29 analysts with earnings expectations revising their views, for an average drop of 9.3 percent.
""Shell was the only company we expected to show profit growth this quarter, but it missed by quite a bit, which really raises concerns,"" said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ""I wouldn't be surprised if estimates kept coming down.""

899,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2015 11:04AM ET</span>","U.S. economy cools in fourth quarter, but consumer spending shines","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter as weak business spending and a wider trade deficit offset the fastest pace of consumer spending since 2006.
Gross domestic product expanded at a 2.6 percent annual pace after the third quarter's spectacular 5 percent rate, the Commerce Department said in its first fourth-quarter GDP snapshot on Friday. 
The slowdown, which follows two back-to-back quarters of bullish growth, is likely to be short-lived given the enormous tailwind from lower gasoline prices. Most economists believe fundamentals in the United States are strong enough to cushion the blow on growth from weakening overseas economies.
""We look for strong domestic consumption to continue supporting growth momentum in the coming quarters even as investment suffers due to falling oil prices,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Even with the moderation in the fourth quarter, growth remained above the 2.5 percent pace, which is considered to be the economy's potential. Economists had expected GDP to expand at a 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter. 
U.S. stock index futures extended losses and prices for U.S. Treasuries rose further after the data. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies.
For all of 2014, the economy grew 2.4 percent compared to 2.2 percent in 2013. The report came two days after the Federal Reserve said the economy was growing at a ""solid pace,"" an upgraded assessment that keeps it on track to start raising interest rates this year. 
The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008 and most economists expect a mid-year lift-off.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, advanced at a 4.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter - the fastest since the first quarter of 2006 and an acceleration from the third quarter's 3.2 percent pace.
According to government data, gasoline prices have plunged 43 percent since June, leaving Americans with more money for discretionary spending. A strengthening labor market, despite sluggish wage growth, is also a boost.
MUTED INFLATION
A separate report from the Labor Department showed labor costs rising steadily in the fourth quarter, but remaining well below levels that would bring inflation closer to the Fed's 2 percent target.
Inflation pressures were muted in the fourth quarter. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index fell at a 0.5 percent rate, the weakest reading since the first quarter of 2009. Excluding food and energy, prices rose at a 1.1 percent pace, the slowest since the second quarter of 2013.
The strong pace of consumer spending in the fourth quarter, however, was overshadowed by a drop in capital expenditure. Business spending on equipment fell at a 1.9 percent rate. It was the largest contraction since the second quarter of 2009. 
Business spending on equipment had advanced at an 11 percent rate in the third quarter. The fourth-quarter weakness could reflect cuts or delays to investment projects in the oil industry. But it could also be payback after two back-to-back quarters of robust gains.
A wider trade deficit, as slower global growth curbed exports and solid domestic demand sucked in imports, subtracted 1.02 percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Trade had added 0.78 percentage point to third-quarter growth. 
Restocking by businesses to meet growing demand contributed 0.82 percentage point to fourth-quarter GDP.

Other details of the report were mixed. Government spending was a drag as a defense-driven investment burst faded. Residential construction made a mild contribution to GDP growth.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.6 percent after an unrevised 0.7 percent gain in the third quarter, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the employment cost index rising 0.6 percent in the October-December period.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack.
Unlike the average hourly earnings (AHE) measure in the employment report, the ECI covers a broad range of workers and is weighted to eliminate composition effects, which economists say have distorted the AHE.
It is seen as a better predictor of core inflation. Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, increased 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
They had gained 0.8 percent in the third quarter. The slowdown in the fourth quarter was flagged by a surprise decline in the average hourly earnings in December.
The Fed ramped up its assessment of the labor market on Wednesday, which economists interpreted as a signal for a mid-year rate hike.
In the 12 months through December, labor costs increased 2.2 percent. That is still below the 3 percent threshold that economists say is needed to bring inflation closer to the Fed's 2 percent target. Labor costs had increased 2.2 percent in the 12 months through September.
Wages and salaries were up 2.1 percent in the 12 months through December after a similar gain in the 12 months through September.
Benefit costs increased 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter. That followed a similar gain in the July-September period.
They increased 2.6 percent in the 12 months through December, the largest jump since March 2012, after rising 2.4 percent in the 12 months through September.

901,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 30, 2015 06:45AM ET</span>",Euro Zone Prices Fall At Record-Equaling Pace In January,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Euro zone consumer prices fell at a record-equaling pace in January, more steeply than expected and supporting the backers of the European Central Bank's money-printing plan to combat sustained deflation. The European statistics office said in a first estimate on Friday that prices in the 19 countries using the single currency in January were 0.6 percent lower than a year earlier, after a 0.2 percent decline in December.
This was a sharper fall than 0.5 percent decline forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
The euro zone has only endured negative inflation rates in one other period, from June to October 2009. The 0.6 percent decline this month matched the lowest figure during that period, in July 2009.
Sharply reduced fuel costs explained the drop.
Energy prices plunged 8.9 percent. Unprocessed food was 0.9 percent cheaper, outweighing a 1.0 percent rise in the cost of services. Oil prices have more than halved since June, with Brent at just below $50 per barrel on Friday.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, dipped to a new euro-era low of 0.6 percent in January from 0.7 percent for the previous three months.
Aline Schuiling, senior euro zone economist ABN Amro, said she did not believe this marked the start of a negative trend in core inflation, with Thursday's German inflation figures influenced by one-offs such as the timing of sales and volatile prices of package holidays.
Other economists said the impact of certain tax hikes a year ago could have led to the euro zone core figure dropping.
Headline inflation has also been in what the ECB calls the 'danger zone' below 1 percent since October 2013.
The ECB aims to keep inflation just under 2 percent over the medium term and the risk of sustained deflation led it earlier this month to launch a 1.1 trillion euro quantitative easing program of government-bond buying.
The euro zone's central bank plans to purchase sovereign debt from March this year until September 2016 releasing 60 billion euros a month into the economy.
""It confirms the point of view of the doves that the ECB is on the right track. That's the basic message,"" said Commerzbank economist Bernd Weidensteiner, adding that if inflation remained low then pressure could mount for the ECB to increase its monthly bond purchases.
""However, we think inflation is nearing its low point and from March will start to rise again if oil is stable,"" he said.
Germany this month joined the countries with negative inflation rates this month.
In Spain, consumer prices fell for a seventh consecutive month and at their fastest rate in the euro zone era.
Eurostat's flash estimate for the month does not include a monthly calculation.
In separate release, Eurostat said euro zone unemployment dipped to 11.4 percent in December, after three months stuck at 11.5 percent. The number of people without a job decreased by 157,000 from a month before to 18.129 million."
902,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 30, 2015 12:45AM ET</span>",Slowing Inflation Keeps Bank Of Japan Under Pressure,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Japan's core consumer inflation slowed for a fifth straight month in December hit by collapsing oil prices, keeping the central bank under pressure to meet its ambitious 2 percent inflation target.
But factory output rose 1.0 percent in December helped by a much-awaited rebound in exports and manufacturers expect to increase production in January, boding well for an economy emerging from recession.
The pick-up in output backs up the Bank of Japan's argument that a solid economic recovery will help accelerate inflation toward its target early next year, although oil price falls will continue to weigh on inflation in the short run.
Excluding the effect of a sales tax hike in April last year, core consumer price index (CPI) - which excludes volatile fresh food but includes oil products - stood at 0.5 percent, just a quarter of the way in achieving the BOJ's 2 percent target.
The headline core consumer inflation rose 2.5 percent in the year to December, government data showed on Friday. That was less than a median market forecast of a 2.6 percent increase.
The increase in December output compared with a median market forecast for a 1.3 percent gain. Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to rise 6.3 percent in January but fall 1.8 percent in February, the data showed.
The government raised its assessment on output to say it is ""picking up moderately."" In the previous month, it said output was flat.
Japan's economy slipped into recession in the third quarter of last year as exports failed to pick up and last April's sales tax hike cooled consumer spending.
Analysts expect the economy to have expanded an annualized 3.2 percent in October-December as the tax-hike pain subsides, a Reuters poll showed.
In a sign the recovery will be fragile, however, household spending fell 3.4 percent in the year to December, separate data showed on Friday, more than a median market forecast."
903,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2015 02:22PM ET</span>","U.S. homeownership hits 20-year low, but new households growing","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homeownership fell to a 20-year low in the fourth quarter, but a sharp rebound in the rate at which Americans are setting up home is expected to help drive a pick-up in housing.
The seasonally adjusted home ownership rate slipped to 63.9 percent, the lowest level since the third quarter of 1994, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. The rate, which peaked at 69.4 percent in 2004, was 64.3 percent in the third quarter.
Household formation, however, more than quadrupled to 1.7 million in the fourth quarter from only 356,000 in the same period in 2013. While the gains were driven by renter households, that should provide a boost to home building.
Housing has lagged an acceleration in the broader economy. But with household formation picking up, thanks to a strengthening labor market, and the government taking steps to ease credit requirements for first-time buyers, housing is expected to regain momentum this year.
""The combination of a high share of young adults living in the parental home, falling mortgage rates and loosening credit means that the outlook for household formation is strengthening,"" said Paul Diggle, a property economist at Capital Economics in London.
""That's one of the reasons why we are optimistic about the prospects for homebuilding over the next few years.""
The residential rental vacancy rate dropped four-tenths of a percentage point to 7.0 percent in the fourth quarter, the lowest level since 1993. That will likely make renting expensive and increase the appeal of owning a house, economists said.
""Household formation is picking up fast enough to outpace construction and is likely to be channeled in a constructive manner, since rents and home prices continue to rise at a healthy pace,"" said Stephanie Karol, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. 
Homeownership dropped across all four regions in the fourth quarter, with declines pronounced in almost all age groups, with the exception of 45-54-year-olds, a group that saw a very mild gain.
Many economists believe the homeownership rate will probably start stabilizing in the coming quarters. 
""The decade-long decline in the share of the population who own their home may now be drawing to an end,"" said Diggle.

""Wage growth may soon accelerate, helping young households to make the leap into homeownership. The survey evidence certainly suggests that owning a home remains part of most people's perception of the American dream.""

Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says fewer homes available for sale and a slight acceleration in prices likely led to December’s decline in contract signings.

Divergences continue among regions, with growth in China, Japan and the euro area easing in recent quarters, while growth in the US has remained robust.World oil prices have fallen 60 percent since June last year, which will boost spending power in oil importing economies but reduce incomes for oil exporters. The oil price decline, together with uncertainties around the transition of US monetary policy, has led to an increase in financial market volatility.The lower oil price will have a significant impact on prices and activity in New Zealand. The most direct and immediate effects are through fuel prices, with the price of regular petrol falling from a national average of $2.23 in mid-2014 to $1.73 currently. This will increase households' purchasing power and lower the cost of doing business.Annual economic growth in New Zealand is above 3 percent, supported by rising construction activity and household incomes. The housing market is showing signs of picking up, particularly in Auckland. However, fiscal consolidation, the reduced dairy payout, the risk of drought, and the high exchange rate will weigh on growth.While the New Zealand dollar has eased recently, we believe the exchange rate remains unjustified in terms of current economic conditions, particularly export prices, and unsustainable in terms of New Zealand's long-term economic fundamentals. We expect to see a further significant depreciation.The high exchange rate, low global inflation, and falling oil prices are causing traded goods inflation to be very weak. Non-tradables inflation remains moderate, despite buoyant domestic demand and an improving labour market.Headline annual inflation is expected to be below the target band through 2015, and could become negative for a period before moving back towards 2 percent, albeit more gradually than previously anticipated.In the current circumstances, we expect to keep the OCR on hold for some time.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A gauge of U.S. business investment plans fell for a fourth straight month in December, a potential sign that slowing global growth and falling oil prices were weighing on the economy.
Other data on Tuesday, however, suggested any damage would be limited. Consumer confidence vaulted to a near 7-1/2 high in January and new home sales in December hit their highest level since June 2008.
""The drop in (capital spending) will weigh on growth, though stronger consumer spending should keep GDP from slowing too much,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.6 percent last month after a similar decline in November. 
Orders for these so-called core capital goods starting decreasing in September, the longest downward stretch since 2012.
Economists, who had expected a 0.5 percent gain, said the surprise drop last month likely reflected weak overseas demand for a wide range of capital goods and declining demand at home for energy-related equipment. They also cited a strengthening dollar as a factor.
The dour report came as construction and mining equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (N:CAT) reported a nearly 25 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit and warned that falling oil prices would hurt its business in 2015.
A number of U.S. producers already have curtailed drilling activity and announced job cuts amid an oil glut that has slashed crude prices by about 60 percent since June. 
Dollar strength is also undermining corporate profits. Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG), the world's largest household products maker, pointed to the dollar and said full-year sales were likely to fall 3 percent to 4 percent. Chemicals company DuPont (N:DD) also forecast lower operating earnings for 2015.
Microsoft Corp (O:MSFT) on Monday said the dollar was a factor behind a decline in its quarterly earnings as well.
Weak equipment spending is likely to catch the attention of Federal Reserve officials, who have been eyeing mid-year for a possible interest rate hike. Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday.
""This is ... evidence that the dollar's strength is starting to show up in terms of weaker orders, a new soft spot for manufacturing that perhaps will give some of the policymakers pause if not worry,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
WEAK SHIPMENTS
The downbeat data overshadowed a separate report from the Conference Board showing consumer sentiment this month jumped to its highest level since August 2007.
U.S. stocks fell sharply, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt soared, with the yield on the 30-year bond falling to a record low. The dollar weakened against a basket of currencies. 
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, fell 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.6 percent in November and 0.9 percent in October.
Economists said that suggested a downside risk to their fourth-quarter GDP estimates, most of which currently hover around a 3 percent annual pace. The government will publish its first snapshot of fourth-quarter growth on Friday.
With core capital good orders falling, overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - tumbled 3.4 percent in December. It was the fifth straight monthly decline.
Still, the economy appears to be in reasonable health. Services sector activity picked up in January for the first time since June, financial data firm Markit said separately.
Another report from the Commerce Department showed new home sales jumped in December to their highest level since 2008. The increase came as mortgage rates trended lower, fueling a jump in home loan applications this month.
""January's impressive surge in mortgage applications suggests we may see continued momentum in new home sales,"" said Derek Lindsey, an analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. A fourth report, however, showed a deceleration in house price gains. The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas rose 4.3 percent in November from the prior year, the slowest since October 2012.

Housing lagged growth in the overall economy last year, but it is expected to get a boost from a strengthening jobs market. Slowing house price gains together with moves by the government to ease credit conditions also are seen helping.

The December figure was originally reported as 92.6.

Consumers also expressed a considerably higher degree of optimism regarding the short-term outlook for the economy and labor market, as well as their earnings,"" Lynn Franco, the Conference Board's director of economic indicators, said in a statement.
The survey's present situation index improved to 112.6 in January from an upwardly revised 99.9 in December, while the expectations index rose to 96.4 from 88.5.
The jobs ""hard-to-get"" index fell again, suggesting less pessimism among Americans seeking jobs. This labor gauge declined to 25.7 in January from a downwardly revised 27.3 previous month.
Consumers' inflation outlook remained stable despite the recent drop in gasoline prices. The Conference Board's one-year consumer inflation rate expectation was 5.0 percent. December's inflation index was revised down to 5.0 percent from the originally reported 5.1 percent.

939,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2015 06:00AM ET</span>","British growth slows, but 2014 still fastest in seven years","By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economic growth slowed more than expected in the final three months of last year, but with annual growth still at its fastest since 2007 the data gave ammunition to both sides of the political divide heading into May's election.
Tuesday's data showed some loss of momentum. Growth in the third quarter fell to 0.5 percent from 0.7 percent in the third, slower than the 0.6 percent growth most private-sector economists had expected in a Reuters poll.
But for the year as a whole, the economy grew by 2.6 percent, the Office for National Statistics said, up from 1.7 percent in 2013 and putting it on track to have been the world's fastest-growing major advanced economy last year.
While most countries have not yet reported 2014 growth data, Britain's is ahead of International Monetary Fund estimates for other big developed nations, a fillip for British Prime Minister David Cameron who faces a national election on May 7.
""The recovery is on track and our plan is protecting Britain from the economic storm -- now is not the time to abandon that plan and return Britain to economic chaos,"" finance minister George Osborne said after the data.
Sterling weakened against the dollar and the euro as the data reinforced views that the Bank of England is unlikely to raise interest rates this year while wage growth stays weak.
It is also unclear whether 2014's growth marks a temporary high point as the economy finally started to rebound strongly after years of sub-par growth following the financial crisis.
The IMF forecasts growth in Britain of 2.7 percent in 2015. Economists polled by Reuters predict a slowdown to 2.4 percent.
""TOO EARLY"" TO CALL IT A SLOWDOWN
ONS Chief Economist Joe Grice said it was ""too early to say"" if this slowdown would persist.
""The dominant services sector remains buoyant while the contraction has taken place in industries like construction, mining and energy supply, which can be erratic,"" he said.
Services output grew by 0.8 percent on the quarter, the same as in the third quarter. But overall GDP growth was held back by the biggest quarterly falls in construction and industrial output since 2012.
""The main disappointment with growth in the fourth quarter was that it looks unbalanced,"" said IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer.""
Weaker gas and electricity and generation dragged on industrial output -- possibly linked to slightly warmer than usual weather over some of the quarter.
The retail sector drove services growth, a reminder of how Britain's recovery remains reliant on consumers.
This was reinforced by December data from the British Bankers' Association which showed unsecured lending to consumers grew at its fastest annual rate in six years.
In the immediate future there will be further support to household demand from the sharp drop in oil prices.
However, economists are concerned that investment may suffer from uncertainty about May's possibly inconclusive election.
Britain's economy is now 3.4 percent larger than its peak before the financial crisis, and about 8 percent bigger than when Cameron's Conservative-led coalition won power in May 2010.
Much of this has been driven by a higher population and output per head is still below pre-crisis levels.

Wages are only now starting to grow faster than inflation, prompting the opposition Labour party to continue to focus on a ""cost of living crisis"" in the run-up to the election.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports grew the most in a year in December, helped by a weak yen and a pick-up in overseas demand led by the United States, an encouraging sign for the recession-hit economy even as doubts persist about the strength of global consumption.
The 12.9 percent year-on-year rise in exports marked a fourth straight month of growth, supported by shipments of cars to the United States and of electronics parts to China, data by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) showed on Monday.
A recovery in exports, which has been a soft spot in the world's third-largest economy, could be a source of comfort for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is battling to re-kindle growth after an April sales tax hike drove Japan into a recession.
Still, with the exception of the United States, a largely gloomy global economic outlook has cast a cloud over external demand. The slump in oil prices to below $50 a barrel has also heightened global consumption and deflation concerns.
Imports rose less than expected, leaving Japan with a trade deficit for a record 30th month in a row.
""Exports have bottomed out but I doubt whether they will accelerate from now on due to growing uncertainty over the global economy,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The MOF data showed exports to the United States rose 23.7 percent in the year to December, while those to China rose 4.3 percent.
Shipments to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese shipments, grew 11.0 percent year-on-year in December. EU-bound exports rose 6.8 percent.
Overall imports rose 1.9 percent on the year in December versus a 2.3 percent gain expected, as sharp falls in crude oil prices cut into the value of purchases.
That helped cut the December trade nearly in half from a year ago to 660.7 billion yen ($5.62 billion).
For the full-year 2014, however, Japan's trade deficit hit a record 12.78 trillion yen, largely due to heavy imports of liquefied natural gas as utilities burned more of the fuel to compensate for the shutdown of all nuclear plants for safety checks after the Fukushima disaster of 2011.
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD
But cheap oil also compounds the challenge for the BOJ's aim of hitting its 2 percent inflation goal around the coming fiscal year from April, which analysts see as impossible to achieve.
Indeed, on Wednesday the BOJ sharply cut its inflation forecast, and Governor Haruhiko Kuroda conceded it may take longer than expected to hit the price target.
The yen has fallen sharply against the dollar although it has pulled back from recent lows. The dollar was at around 118 yen on Monday, off a 7-year high of above 120 yen hit last month, but still about 35 percent higher since Abe took office in late 2012.
Despite the yen's depreciation under Abenomics stimulus policies, exports have been slow to pick up as Japanese firms shifted production overseas, while others have sought to boost profits by maintaining sales prices rather than cutting them to boost their export volume.
New domestic orders and new export orders both rose at a faster clip in January, a private manufacturing survey showed last week.

SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's crusade to win back investor confidence has entrusted policymakers with the tough mission of hiking interest rates while major central banks cut them, raising the prospect of another recession in Latin America's biggest economy.
As it boosted the benchmark Selic rate to 12.25 percent on Wednesday, the third consecutive rate hike since Rousseff won re-election in October, Brazil's central bank sought to deliver on its pledge to do ""whatever it takes"" to bring down inflation currently running at about 6.5 percent annually.
The move left the Brazilian central bank at odds with the European Central Bank, which unveiled a massive bond-buying program on Thursday, as well as policymakers in Canada, Denmark, India and Turkey, who recently cut interest rates after the sharp drop in oil prices and forecasts of slower global growth.
Brazil's strategy seems to be paying off, for now.
Investors, also encouraged by a package of austerity measures unveiled this week, have been cautiously buying government bonds and driving long-term interest rates lower.
The Brazilian real <BRL=> has gained 3 percent since the beginning of the year while returns on local-currency government bonds have totaled 4.9 percent in dollar terms during the same period, according to a benchmark JP Morgan index .
That has provided rare good news for Rousseff, who has otherwise been battered by a weak economy, plunging business confidence, energy blackouts and a corruption scandal since she began her second term on Jan. 1.
Javier Murcio, a Boston-based portfolio manager at Standish Mellon Asset Management, which oversees $10 billion in emerging market assets, said the fund was currently ""slightly overweight"" on Brazil's local currency debt.
""If we see an improvement in the macro conditions, then we will go more overweight,"" he said.
Dollar inflows have also picked up as investors try to take advantage of one of the world's highest interest rates. About $2.3 billion have flown into Brazil during the week ending Jan 16, practically offsetting outflows of $2.4 billion recorded during the first nine days of the year, central bank data showed <BRCAPF=ECI>.
RISKY PATH
Yet the central bank is going down a dangerous path that could drive Latin America's largest economy into a recession for the second time in less than two years, following a brief contraction last year.
That, in turn, has investors wondering if Rousseff, a leftist, will have the stomach needed to maintain unpopular policies such as interest rate hikes.
""The big question is whether these policies will have the necessary political backing,"" said Enestor dos Santos, an economist with BBVA in Madrid. ""Perhaps the initial plan was to implement a small adjustment that wouldn't take the economy into a recession but, if it doesn't happen like that, will the government continue to support it?""
A pullback from recently-unveiled austerity measures could rock Brazilian financial markets, driving investors out of the country and costing Brazil its coveted investment-grade rating.
Rising interest rates have already hurt Brazilians' purchasing power, with 2014 retail sales believed to have posted their worst performance in 11 years. Mortgages also became more expensive after state-lender Caixa Economic Federal last week raised lending rates to as high as 11 percent from 9.2 percent.
Economists already expected a tough year, with forecasts for a mere 0.32 percent economic growth, according to a weekly central bank survey of about 100 analysts.
Other economic headwinds abound.
A widening corruption scandal at state-run oil company Petrobras (SA:PETR4) has slowed investment in the oil sector while a prolonged draught is sharply increasing the cost of Brazil's hydroelectric-based power generation.
Lower commodity prices also make it harder for the country to restore its trade balance, which in 2014 posted its first deficit in 14 years.
Despite such problems, the central bank on Wednesday left the door open to raise the base Selic rate by another 50 basis points in its next meeting rather than slow the pace of monetary tightening, as many economists expected.
Banks have been slashing their forecasts for Brazil's economic growth as a result. Some, such as HSBC and Credit Suisse, now expect gross domestic product to contract 0.5 percent this year.
""There is no doubt (the central bank's policy) is having a negative impact on the economy,"" said BBVA's Santos.

974,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2015 01:19PM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims off seven-month high; oil layoffs watched,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week from a seven-month high, pointing to continued improvement in labor market conditions.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 307,000 for the week ended Jan. 17, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
That reversed the bulk of the prior week's increase which had pushed claims to their highest level since early June, but fell short of economists expectations for a 300,000 reading.
Economists had dismissed the prior week's increase as ""noise"" given that claims data is difficult to adjust for seasonal variations around the holidays. Some, however, wondered if some of the elevation in claims reflected layoffs in the oil industry in the wake of plunging crude prices.
""It is unclear at this point whether or not this move up in the trend reflects issues seasonally adjusting the data around the holidays or if it represents a more meaningful deterioration in the labor market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York.
State-level data for the week ending Jan. 10 showed an increase in claims in the oil-producing states like Texas, Louisiana and North Dakota. But claims also rose in states such Missouri, Indiana and Illinois, which are not oil-dependent.
Oilfield service provider Baker Hughes Inc (N:BHI) this week announced it would cut 7,000 jobs, with most of the redundancies expected in the first quarter, because of slowing drilling activity. Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) has announced 9,000 job cuts.
Crude oil prices   have plunged almost 60 percent since June, hitting five-year lows as increased shale production in the United States and weak global demand has caused a glut on the market.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 6,500 last week to 306,500, taking it above the 300,000 mark for the first time since September.
The claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed employers for January's nonfarm payrolls. 
Despite the gyrations in claims and the four-week average rising 7,750 between the December and January payroll survey periods, there is little doubt that the labor market is tightening. 
Employment gains have exceeded 200,000 in each of the last 11 months, the longest stretch since 1994, and job openings are near 14-year highs. In addition, the ratio of unemployed people for every job opening is the lowest since early 2008.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 15,000 to 2.44 million in the week ended Jan. 10.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Groundbreaking for U.S. single-family homes raced to the highest level in more than 6-1/2 years in December and permits surged, in a hopeful sign for the sluggish housing market recovery.
Housing has lagged an acceleration in economic growth, but Wednesday's report hinted at a pick-up in activity. That should help to further strengthen the U.S. economy's fundamentals as it confronts headwinds from slowing global growth.
""The last piece of the economic puzzle is starting to come together now as housing construction is coming back. The housing market is continuing to heal,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that single-family housing starts, the largest part of the market, jumped 7.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 728,000-units - the highest level since March 2008. 
That offset a 0.8 percent fall in groundbreaking for the volatile multi-family homes segment, lifting overall housing starts 4.4 percent to a 1.09 million-unit rate last month. Wall Street had forecast starts rising to a 1.04 million-unit pace.
Homebuilder shares were trading higher on the data, helping the housing index to outperform the broader U.S. stock market. DR Horton, the largest homebuilder, rose 0.65 percent, while Lennar Corp gained 1.03 percent and Pulte Group was up 0.19 percent.
IMPROVEMENT EYED
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to buy homes fell 3 percent last week after a 24 percent surge in the week ending Jan. 9.
Tepid wage growth has constrained housing, sidelining first-time buyers from the market and forcing many young adults, most of whom are saddled with college debts, to stay at home with their parents or share lodgings with relatives and friends.
The resulting weak household formation, in particular, has hurt residential construction. Household formation is currently running at about 500,000 a year, far below the more than 1-million mark that would signal a robust housing market.
But with wage growth expected to pick up, the 30-year mortgage rate down more than 80 basis points from early 2014 and moves by the government to ease credit conditions, housing is seen gaining momentum this year and expected to help soften the blow from slowing global economic growth.
""This should allow for many more individuals to enter the market. We expect much of the improvement to occur in sales at the lower end of the market, which has been lagging the overall housing recovery,"" said David Nice, an economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
For all of 2014, groundbreaking increased 8.8 percent to 1.01 million units, the highest since 2007. Single-family housing starts in 2014 were also the highest in seven years. 
While overall permits for future home building fell 1.9 percent in December, they were dragged down by an 11.8 percent plunge in the multi-family segment. 

Single-family permits rose 4.5 percent to their highest level since January 2008, with permits in the populous South hitting their highest level since February 2008.

995,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 21, 2015 06:01AM ET</span>",Bank Of England Dissenters Drop Call For Higher Rates,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - The Bank of England voted unanimously to keep rates on hold in January for the first time since July, after two policymakers dropped their call for higher rates in the face of tumbling inflation.
External members of the Monetary Policy Committee Martin Weale and Ian McCafferty, who since August had called for an end to record-low interest rates, said a rate rise now might cause below-target inflation to become entrenched.
British inflation last month unexpectedly tumbled to 0.5 percent, its lowest level in more than 14 years and far below the BoE's 2 percent target.
""For the two members who had voted in the previous month for an increase in Bank Rate, the decision this month was finely balanced,"" the minutes said.
""They noted the risk that low inflation might persist for longer than the temporary factors implied and concluded that this risk would be increased by an increase in Bank Rate at the current juncture.""
BoE Governor Mark Carney has said inflation could turn negative in the coming months but that the central bank saw no need for more stimulus and still planned to raise rates within the foreseeable future.
The minutes showed that the BoE saw a ""roughly even"" chance of this happening at some point in the first half of 2015.
However, the minutes said policymakers expected this to be temporary so long as oil prices did not fall further.
In the medium term they saw potential upward pressures on prices from signs of a pick-up in wages, lower mortgage interest rates and nominal incomes rising faster than inflation.
Oil fell as much as 5 percent to less than $48 a barrel on Tuesday after the International Monetary Fund cut its 2015 global economic forecast and Iran hinted prices could drop to $25 a barrel without supportive OPEC action.
Carney has said that the fall in oil prices is a net positive for Britain's economy and that the BoE would look through the direct effect on inflation of lower oil prices.
The BoE has focused more on wage growth as it considers when to start raising rates. Data due to be released at the same time of the minutes on Wednesday is expected to show earnings rising faster than inflation for a third successive month in November.
Markets have pushed back their bets on the timing of the next interest rate hike markedly over the past few months, and are now pricing in the first move next year."

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan cut next fiscal year's inflation forecast on Wednesday and expanded a loan scheme aimed at boosting lending, hoping to deflect criticism it is sitting idly by as a slump in oil prices pushes inflation further away from its target.
As widely expected, the BOJ held off on expanding its massive stimulus program and maintained its pledge to increase base money at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($678 billion) through buying government bonds and risk assets.
In a review of its long-term estimates, the BOJ cut its core consumer inflation forecast for the year beginning in April to 1.0 percent from 1.7 percent projected three months ago.
But it slightly raised its inflation forecast for fiscal 2016 to 2.2 percent from 2.1 percent, a sign central bankers are publicly sticking to the view Japan will hit an inflation goal of 2 percent.
Markets are focusing on how Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, at his post-meeting briefing at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT), will reconcile the new projections with the pledge he had made that the BOJ will achieve 2 percent inflation next fiscal year.
""I want to hear if Kuroda will continue to express confidence in meeting his target in fiscal 2015 or whether he will change his assessment,"" said Daiju Aoki, an economist at UBS Securities.
""If the BOJ is delaying its target without easing policy again, I think there will be some disappointment in the market.""
The BOJ expanded its ""quantitative and qualitative easing"" (QQE) less than three months ago to prevent oil price falls and a subsequent slowdown in price rises from weighing on inflation expectations.
The relentless drop in oil prices, which have nearly halved since October, has kept alive expectations the BOJ will expand QQE again soon. Some investors sold the yen ahead of Wednesday's meeting in a precautionary move against a surprise action.
The dollar dropped to a session low against the yen after the BOJ's announcement that it held monetary policy steady.
The BOJ's new price forecast is still much higher than the 0.6 percent forecast from analysts polled by Reuters, many of whom expect the bank to ease again as early as April.
The BOJ revised up next fiscal year's economic growth forecast to 2.1 percent from 1.5 percent, suggesting that a pick-up in growth will boost wages and accelerate inflation.
Many BOJ policymakers are increasingly wary of expanding QQE further with the bank's huge purchases already pushing five-year government bond yields into negative territory.
The BOJ instead extended for a year two loan schemes aimed at encouraging banks to lend more, expanding one of them by 3 trillion yen.
The BOJ issues a semi-annual report with forecasts on the economy and prices in April and October of each year. It reviews the projections at rate reviews in January and July.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's economy grew at its slowest pace in 24 years in 2014 as property prices cooled and companies and local governments struggled under heavy debt burdens, keeping pressure on Beijing to take aggressive steps to avoid a sharper downturn.
European and Asian shares in fact rose on relief that the news was not worse; the Shanghai Composite index gained 1.85 percent, Japan's Nikkei 225 index saw its biggest one-day gain in a month and European markets rallied.
But for investors worried about growth in China and the world this year, the data poses two questions:
Will the soft numbers and expectations of further weakness force the central bank to pump hundreds of billions of dollars into banks system-wide to prop up growth? And if so, what does that mean for Beijing's attempts to reform its economy?
The world's second-largest economy grew 7.4 percent in 2014, official data showed on Tuesday, barely missing its official 7.5 percent target but still the slowest since 1990, when it was hit by sanctions in the wake of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. It expanded 7.7 percent in 2013.
Fourth-quarter growth held steady at 7.3 percent from a year earlier, slightly better than expectations.
Few had expected China to meet its 7.5 percent full-year target, but the performance was better than some had feared after a rough few months raised concerns the economy may be heading for a hard landing.
""The country's period of miraculous break-neck growth is over, but let's get over it,"" said a commentary on the official Xinhua news service, referring to a long string of double-digit expansion.
""The end of the high-speed growth era does not spell an end for China's economy.""
""QUITE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT""
Modest support measures from the government over the year helped stave off a more dramatic slowdown, while Beijing's tolerance of somewhat slower growth sent a message that reform remains a priority.
""This is the best possible miss you could have from a messaging standpoint,"" said Andrew Polk, economist at the Conference Board in Beijing.
""The government is saying, 'we're not married to this specific target, we missed it and we're okay.' That seems to me a quite positive development.""
Still, a further slowdown in China could hinder the chances of a revival in global growth in 2015, given the major role it plays, in particular for commodities and high-tech. 
Indeed, Polk said the GDP figure was difficult to square with other negative signs.
China's property market - a major driver of demand across a range of industries - has proven stubbornly unresponsive to policy support, and lending data from the banking system shows both enduring weakness and a resurgence in the shadow banking system, which Beijing has been struggling to rein in.
Policymakers also are concerned about the potential onset of a deflationary cycle, aggravated by plummeting energy prices, industrial overcapacity and sluggish demand.
Systemic deflation, an economically toxic cycle in which investors and consumers hold off on fresh spending on the assumption prices will drop further in the future, could leave China in a similar condition to Japan, and is cited as a major reason why Beijing will need to put more money into the system.
At the same time, there may be a looming fiscal crisis among debt-sodden local governments, which depend on land sales for most of their revenue. And more companies, especially small property developers, could flirt with default.
Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist Olivier Blanchard said slower growth seen for 2015 reflects a welcome decision by the Chinese government to rebalance the economy away from a heavy reliance on investment and exports to a more consumption-based growth model.
The IMF predicts China's economy will grow 6.8 percent in 2015, while the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists sees an expansion of around 7 percent. 
December data posted numerous upside surprises after a weak November. Factory output rose 7.9 percent, while retail sales rose 11.9 percent, both above market expectations.
However, growth in fixed asset investment, a key growth driver, eased to 15.7 percent in the whole of 2014 from the previous year, hovering near a 13-year low.
Investment growth in real estate slowed to a five-year low and new construction slumped, even as home sales improved at the end of the year.
MORE EASING OR LESS?
With China's growth seen cooling further this year, more support measures are still expected, though economists are divided over what tools policymakers will use and when.
""The overall numbers lower the need for further stimulus, although there remains some room for easing as risks are still skewed to the downside,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong.
He expected the central bank to cut interest rates again in the first quarter, after a surprise move in November, and slash banks' required reserve ratio (RRR) by 100 basis points in the first half of 2015 in a bid to spur more lending.
Others, however, think Beijing may have to get more aggressive, even at risk of reinflating asset bubbles, given the need to reduce debt burdens at Chinese companies which are inhibiting them from fresh investments.
""I don't expect monetary policy to accelerate growth, though,"" said Wang of UBS.
""Final demand in the economy is very weak and it's unlikely that the corporate sector will take this credit and invest in new projects, so containing financial risk and stabilizing growth is the trend for this year.""

1015,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 19, 2015 03:45AM ET</span>",Britain's Financial Sector Reports Fastest Growth Since 1996 In Q4,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Britain's financial sector reported the biggest upsurge in business in nearly 20 years in the final three months of last year, the Confederation of British Industry said on Monday.
The CBI said its quarterly financial services business volume index rose to +57 in December from +49 in September and its highest since December 1996.
""The upswing in growth among financial services firms continues on a solid footing, with overall optimism, business volumes and profits up,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's director of economics.
The upbeat figures contrast with official data, which showed that financial services output in the three months to October was 3.2 percent lower than a year earlier.
Separate forecasts from accountants Ernst & Young, also released on Monday, show that tumbling oil prices should help Britain's economy as a whole to grow by 2.9 percent this year, half a percentage point faster than thought in October.
""While it is not a game changer in terms of growth prospects, falling oil prices come just as the recovery was losing momentum and will move the game up to a higher level for a year or two,"" said Peter Spencer, an advisor to Ernst & Young.
The CBI survey of lenders, brokers, insurers and asset managers showed that the sector was still cutting jobs, led by the banking and life insurance sectors, though there were skills shortages in some areas such as compliance.
Financial services account for around 10 percent of Britain's economy, a larger share than in other big economies, but the sector has struggled to recover from the 2008-09 crisis.
Mutually owned building societies, which often specialize in mortgage lending, reported a poor quarter due to tighter lending regulations earlier in the year and high house prices relative to incomes in London and southeastern England.
""A strengthening of household finances, continued low interest rates and the recent changes to stamp duty (property transaction tax) suggest that conditions in the sector should pick up ahead,"" Newton-Smith said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest drop in six years in December and a gauge of underlying inflation was flat, which could make the Federal Reserve more cautious about raising interest rates.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index fell 0.4 percent last month, the largest decline since December 2008, after sliding 0.3 percent in November.
In the 12 months through December, the CPI increased just 0.8 percent, the weakest reading since October 2009 and a sharp deceleration from November's 1.3 percent rise.
""The odds of a rate hike in June are fading fast,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut. ""The recent data cannot leave the Fed feeling more confident that inflation will move higher.""
While Fed officials have viewed the energy-driven drop in inflation as transitory, a strong dollar is taming underlying price pressures, which could cause them some discomfort.
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, was unchanged in December. It was only the second time since 2010 that it did not increase.
In the 12 months through December, the core CPI rose 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since February.
Other data on Friday, however, suggested the economy was growing solidly despite the soft inflation readings, with factory output rising last month and consumer sentiment hitting its highest level in 11 years in January.
BULLISH SIGNALS
Fed officials will need to navigate these conflicting signals as they near a decision on when to raise benchmark borrowing costs from near zero, where they have been pegged since December 2008.
""Maybe the data would push us a little bit further one way or the other,"" San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams told a group of business people in San Francisco.
""But I think the good news here is that the economy has improved a lot ... and in fact we are able to start adjusting policy, tightening policy in a way because of that strength.""
Despite a strengthening labor market and economy, inflation does not look like it will reach the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target anytime soon. Indeed, some economists think it could dip into negative territory this year before rebounding.
The softness in core inflation, however, along with darkening prospects for the global economy, is likely more troubling for the Fed.
The 11-year high in consumer sentiment in January reported by the University of Michigan reflected gains in both employment and income, and the boost to spending power from sharply falling gasoline prices.
A separate report from the Fed showed factory output rose 0.3 percent last month, a fourth straight monthly gain. Mining output jumped 2.2 percent on increased oil and gas extraction. Drilling activity, however, fell.
The better prospects for the economy helped to lift U.S. stocks, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
Weaker global demand and increased shale production in the United States have caused an oil glut, sending crude prices tumbling. Brent crude prices neared a six-year low this week. 
In the United States, gasoline prices last month registered their biggest drop in six years. The cost of gasoline has now declined for six straight months.
Food prices rose for the 12th month. Elsewhere, shelter costs increased 0.2 percent, while the rise in medical care commodities prices was the largest since May 1989.

Apparel prices, however, recorded their biggest decline since September 1998, and there were also declines in airfares, new motor vehicle and used cars and trucks prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices in December recorded their biggest fall in more than three years on tumbling energy costs while underlying inflation pressures were tame, a cautionary note for the Federal Reserve as it ponders its next step on monetary policy.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its producer price index for final demand declined 0.3 percent, the biggest drop since October 2011, after falling 0.2 percent in November.
""That makes the Fed's job more difficult,"" said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. ""We expect inflation to slow ... the Fed needs to be more cautious about raising interest rates.""
In the 12 months through December, prices at the factory gate increased 1.1 percent, the smallest gain since November 2013, after rising 1.4 percent in November. 
A broader measure of underlying producer inflation pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services edged up 0.1 percent after being flat in November. 
Fed officials have largely viewed the energy-driven weakness in inflation as transitory. But with retail sales and average hourly earnings, another key inflation measure, falling in December, that could give pause to some policymakers.
The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. A Reuters survey published on Thursday showed nearly two-thirds of the 82 economists polled expected the first interest rate hike by June. 
While interest rate futures have pushed bets into the second half of this year, they continue to point to the first increase occurring in October.
Inflation is running below the Fed's 2 percent target. Consumer inflation data on Friday is expected to show price pressures remaining muted in December.
SEASONAL QUIRKS
In a second report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose by 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 316,000 for the week ended Jan. 10.
Economists, who had forecast claims falling to 291,000 last week, said the data had been distorted by difficulties adjusting it for seasonal fluctuations. Seasonal quirks also have been blamed for the weak retail sales and wage growth in December.
""Seasonal adjustments become particularly difficult around year-end. We expect claims to resume their downward trend in the coming weeks and reflect broader improvement in labor markets,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, remained below 300,000, a level associated with a strengthening labor market, for an 18th straight week. 
Other reports showed mixed fortunes for manufacturing in New York state and the mid-Atlantic region in January. 
Economists said this was broadly in line with some cooling in factory activity in response to slowing global demand and a strong dollar.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose on the data, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond falling to a 20-month low.
The dollar rallied to an 11-year high against the euro after the Swiss National Bank abandoned a three-year-old cap against the single currency. U.S. stocks fell in choppy trade.
Wholesale energy prices dropped a record 6.6 percent in December, declining for a sixth straight month, reflecting falling crude oil prices against the backdrop of weakening global demand and more shale production in the United States.
A strong dollar, as the domestic economy outperforms its global peers, is also helping to curb inflation.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Thursday weak oil prices were unlikely to boost the global economy.

Concerns about global growth have also undercut copper prices. On Thursday, copper rose on a mix of bargain-hunting, short-covering and hedging by consumers, a day after its biggest slide in more than three years, but more losses were expected.

(Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India cut its repo interest rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent in a surprise move on Thursday, making its first reduction in a year as inflation showed signs of slowing and the government was making efforts to contain the fiscal deficit.
The RBI added it could cut interest rates further should inflation continue to ease, while it would also monitor the government's progress on fiscal consolidation.
Helped by plunging global oil prices, India's wholesale price index for December rose just 0.11 percent year-on-year, after staying flat in November, according to data released on Wednesday. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 0.6 percent rise.
Retail inflation, meanwhile, rose to 5 percent in December -- below the 5.4 percent annual rise predicted by analysts in a Reuters poll. The RBI is targeting retail inflation of 6.0 percent by January next year.
In a statement, the RBI cited lower-than-expected inflation, weak crude prices and weak demand as the reasons for its move, as well as the government's commitment to sticking to a fiscal deficit target.
""These developments have provided headroom for a shift in the monetary policy stance,"" it said.
The move, ahead of a Feb. 3 RBI policy meeting and the government's annual budget statement at the end of next month, caught markets off guard.
While the early move was unexpected, aggressive reductions in rates were expected over the course of the year to help India's economy out of a rut, with growth rates struggling to recover from their weakest level in a quarter century.
""The cut was expected in first quarter, but has come sooner than expected and frontrun the February budget,"" said Radhika Rao, economist at DBS Bank Ltd.
""This demonstrates RBI’s confidence in the evolving inflation outlook and it shows that they are putting faith in government’s fiscal consolidation plan.""
The 1-year overnight indexed swap (OIS) earlier this week to as much as 7.59 percent, its lowest since July 2013. According to traders' calculations, that signals expect interest rates to fall below 7 percent.
The finance ministry said it had no immediate comment on the RBI cut and but would issue a statement."

Plunging oil prices since June are beginning to show negative effects in regions that operate heavily within the energy industry, as oil firms reported layoffs and hiring freezes, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s “Beige Book” revealed Wednesday. Oil drilling activity declined in the Fed’s Kansas City district, while the report showed high stockpile levels in crude across the Gulf Coast, a cause for concern for oversupply and less demand.
Economists analyze the Fed’s Beige Book for any indication of when the central bank may raise interest rates, which are currently at historic lows. But the report showed overall price and wage inflation remained modest, while payrolls in a variety of sectors expanded only moderately during the reporting period.
The report, which the central bank publishes eight times a year, highlights the current condition of the U.S. economy within the Fed's 12 districts. It covers a range of economic activity, from manufacturing to construction to wage growth, and offers economists an opportunity to watch for any indication that the U.S. economy is growing stronger or slower than forecast. The Beige Book summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Fed officials.
Energy Firms Report Layoffs, Hiring Freezes
Dallas, the Fed’s 11th district, said hiring was slightly less widespread than in the previous report, while businesses reported hiring freezes and layoffs. Meanwhile, demand for oil field services fell in the 11th district, and declines were concentrated in the Permian Basin as firms moved away from traditional vertical drilling. The Eagle Ford basin, located in South Texas, also saw a slight drop in activity.
“Outlooks for the first half of 2015 are very uncertain and significantly weaker than in the prior reporting period, with firms expecting anywhere from a 15 percent to 40 percent decline in demand for their services,” the Federal Reserve said in the report Wednesday.
Although commercial real estate activity expanded in most of the Fed’s districts, the Dallas district noted that office leasing activity remained strong; but one contact noted a slight pullback in demand from oil and gas firms.
Oil Drilling Activity Declines 
Kansas City, the Federal Reserve’s 10th district, said oil drilling activity declined, and firms expect the district's energy sector to slow further in response to lower energy prices.
The district's energy industry also slowed in December. Most businesses reported lower drilling activity, while demand for oil field services fell. Oil rigs decreased marginally while natural gas rigs increased. “Future drilling activity, employment and capital expenditures were projected to be significantly lower in response to lower oil prices,” the report said.
While the price of U.S. oil has dropped more than 40 percent in the last seven months, trending below $50 a barrel after peaking at more than $100 in June, it’s expected to fall further through early 2015. Firms' opinions were mixed about oil prices one year out, but on average they expected a rebound of $15 to $20 per barrel from year-end 2014 levels. A few firms reported increased difficulties accessing credit due to lower oil prices, according to the report.
High Inventory Levels Across Gulf Coast
Atlanta, the Federal Reserve’s sixth district, said supply of crude oil and natural gas continued to outpace demand, leading to high inventory levels across the Gulf Coast.
Industry contacts in the energy sector reported that the downturn in the price of oil has influenced their outlook and strategic planning for 2015, including increased focus on cost management and faster, more efficient drilling techniques.
Exploration and production firms shared plans to continue drilling operations across the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana in 2015, though they intend to approach projects more cautiously. The same goes for oil service companies in the region, which are evaluating cost-reduction strategies if low energy prices are sustained.
The Beige Book report comes after oil prices extended their rout Wednesday, after U.S. crude oil inventories surged to an 80-year high. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories rose by 5.4 million barrels from the previous week. At 387.8 million barrels, the inventories are at their highest level (for this time of year) in at least 80 years, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.
Low Gasoline Prices Mixed 
Falling crude oil prices have helped send the average price of gasoline down to $2.09 per gallon across America, according to Gasbuddy.com. But reports on the impact of lower gasoline prices were mixed and many firms were uncertain about sales expectations for the first quarter of 2015. Another surprise in the report: General merchandise retailers in the Fed’s New York district said sales were “largely sluggish” and below expectations for the holiday season.
Auto dealers in Atlanta said lower gas prices quickly boosted purchases of larger vehicles; however, some dealers in the St. Louis district reported excess inventories of luxury cars. Auto sales in Kansas City dropped during the reporting period, but remained higher than a year earlier.
Up Next, The Fed's January Policy Meeting
Each of the Fed’s Beige Books is published two weeks before the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is composed of the Fed's seven boards of governors and five Reserve Bank presidents. The FOMC's next and final policy meeting of the year is Jan. 28-29.
Policy officials in the Beige Book said they saw the economy moving at a “modest to moderate” pace, unchanged from the Fed’s previous Beige Book issued on Dec. 3, and consumer spending remained at a “slight to moderate” pace. Most economists expect the Fed to hike rates in mid-2015, but if falling oil prices have a negative effect on an improving U.S. economy, weighing on inflation and wage growth, the Fed could pause before hiking rates.
""The slump in the oil price means that headline inflation is likely to turn negative in the coming months in many advanced economies, just as it already has in the eurozone,"" London-based firm Capital Economics said in a research note. ""In general, deflation in consumer prices should be positive for economic growth. The problems come when deflation is reflected in falling nominal incomes and in asset prices, or when expectations of falling prices become ingrained."""
1051,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2015 03:33PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales drop biggest in 11 months, but seen as a blip","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales recorded their largest decline in 11 months in December as demand fell almost across the board, tempering expectations for a sharp acceleration in consumer spending in the fourth quarter.
Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the surprise weakness, noting that holiday spending made it difficult to smooth December data for seasonal fluctuations.
""Faulty seasonal adjustments from shifts in holiday spending patterns are probably more to blame for the December decline,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG in New York. ""Looking at the last three months, spending is not collapsing."" 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday retail sales fell 0.9 percent, the biggest decline since last January, after increasing 0.4 percent in November. 
Economists had expected only a 0.1 percent drop. Against the backdrop of a strengthening labor market and lower gasoline prices, they said sales should bounce back in January, with some saying December's decline could be revised away.
Bricklin Dwyer, a senior economist at BNP Paribas in New York, said fewer post-Black Friday shopping days in November than normal threw off the so-called seasonal factor used to adjust the data, resulting in a lower December sales number. 
""For January 2015, this seasonal factor will boost sales by the largest factor since 2006,"" said Dwyer.
""This combined with the fact that we have seen a massive boost to consumers' wallets as a result of the rapid decline in gasoline prices, suggests that January could be a big month that reverses much of the December drop,"" he said.
Falling gasoline prices also weighed on the figures. But even excluding the 6.5 percent plunge in receipts at service stations, which was the largest since December 2008, retail sales were down.
Looking over the entire holiday shopping period, sales at many retailers were solid, in sharp contrast to the Commerce Department data. 
The National Retail Federation, which looks at a subset of retail sales that excludes automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants, said 2014 holiday sales increased 4.0 percent from a year earlier, the fastest since 2011.
Separately, the Federal Reserve in its Beige Book said consumer spending increased during the holiday, with ""modest"" year-over-year gains in retail sales.
""This certainly doesn't support the unexpected drop in retail sales,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. 
BROAD WEAKNESS
In December, a so-called core sales gauge that strips out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, fell 0.4 percent after a 0.6 percent rise in November.
Economists had expected this metric, which corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, to rise 0.4 percent last month. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
December's decline prompted some economists to lower estimates for consumer spending in the final three months of 2014 and cut their GDP growth forecasts by as much as 0.3 percentage point to between a 3.0 and 3.4 percent annual pace.
The report combined with concerns over the global economy to push U.S. stocks down, with a broad index of retailers performing in line with the overall market.
The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond fell to a record low as traders pushed back expectations of when the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.
Prior to the report, futures markets pointed to a rate hike in September. After the data, the betting centered on October.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said import prices fell 2.5 percent last month as the cost of energy plummeted. It was the largest decline since December 2008 and followed a 1.8 percent drop in November. 
The weak import prices pointed to subdued inflation pressures over the coming months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. small business optimism jumped in December to its highest level in more than eight years, the latest sign of strength in the economy even as dark clouds settle over global growth.
The outlook was further bolstered by other data on Tuesday showing job openings approached a 14-year high in November.
""There are concerns about global growth, but the fundamentals for the U.S. economy are very solid and what's going on overseas should only be a minor drag,"" said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh.
The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index increased 2.3 points to 100.4 last month, the highest reading since October 2006.
The index, which is back at its pre-recession average, was bolstered by a surge in sales expectations as well as hiring, capital outlays and business expansion plans.
The small business sector accounts for about half of the country's overall gross domestic product and makes up the largest share of hiring.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 2.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted 4.97 million in November, the highest level since January 2001.
""It doesn't get any better than this for the economy. This is another sign that the labor market is tightening up and we are already starting to see more help wanted signs out there in store windows,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
STRONG JOB GROWTH
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report is one of the indicators being closely watched by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and other policymakers at the U.S. central bank as they contemplate the future course of monetary policy.
It confirmed the recent strong trend in job growth and suggested an acceleration in 2015.
While hiring remained below pre-recession levels, there is little doubt the jobs market is tightening.
The JOLTS report showed there were 1.82 people for every open job in November. That was the smallest ratio since January 2008 and compared to 1.86 in October.
""We view this ratio's continued decline as indicative of a reduction in labor market slack,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.
With more slack being absorbed, wage growth should pick up. There are signs an acceleration is under way.
The NFIB survey showed more businesses are raising wages, with a quarter of respondents in December reporting higher compensation - the largest share since January 2008.
Coupled with the growing signs of a tightening jobs market, it suggests a surprise drop in average hourly earnings in December's employment report was a fluke.
""That leaves the slump in average hourly earnings in December looking even odder,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.
The NFIB compensation measure correlates closely with the government's quarterly employment cost index, which is widely regarded as a better gauge of wage growth.

About 17 percent of businesses in the NFIB survey plan to raise compensation in the coming months.

1069,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 13, 2015 05:31AM ET</span>",UK Inflation Falls To 14-Year Low In December,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - British consumer price inflation plummeted last month to its lowest level since May 2000, further easing a squeeze on consumers and leaving the Bank of England under no pressure to raise interest rates soon.
Reflecting a slide in global oil prices, the rate of consumer price inflation halved to an annual 0.5 percent in December from 1.0 percent in November, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected inflation to fall to 0.7 percent.
Weak price growth will be welcomed by British consumers as a boost to their spending power -- in contrast to the euro zone, where falling prices have sparked fears that region could tip into a deflationary spiral.
Surveys of Britons' inflation expectations show that they expect inflation to rise and to be fairly close to the BoE's 2 percent target in coming years.
The ONS said falling petrol prices and lower electricity and gas bills compared with a year ago were the biggest factors pushing down inflation in December.
With crude oil prices falling to their lowest level in nearly six years on Tuesday, this trend looks likely to continue into 2015.
BoE Governor Mark Carney last month described falling oil prices as ""unambiguously net positive"" for Britain's economy.
Next month he will have to explain formally to Finance Minister George Osborne why inflation has now fallen more than a percentage point below the Bank's target. But Osborne is unlikely to be worried.
The fall in inflation has given some respite to households with average earnings rising by more than prices, welcome news for the government ahead of May 7's national election.
Food prices, which have been pushed down by a supermarket price war and lower commodity prices, fell 1.9 percent -- their biggest fall since June 2002.
Consumer price inflation also hit a low of 0.5 percent in May 2000, the lowest rate since records started on this measure in 1989.
In November, the BoE predicted CPI would hit its target of 2 percent only towards the end of 2017. Financial markets are expecting the BoE to start raising rates only in early 2016.
In its release on Tuesday, the ONS said prices at the factory gate fell 0.8 percent in the year to December, the biggest decline since September 2009 and a steeper fall than forecast by economists.
In December alone, crude oil prices paid by British manufacturers fell by 13.2 percent -- the sharpest drop since December 2008.
Separate data from the ONS showed house prices in Britain rose 10.0 percent in yearly terms in November, down from 10.4 percent in October. Other surveys covering the month of December have also shown the rapid pace of house price growth cooling.
Prices in London rose 15.3 percent, while outside the capital and the south-east house prices were 7.1 percent higher."

(Reuters) - China's exports and imports exceeded market expectations in December, a welcome sign that Beijing has found support for its cooling manufacturing sector as a stronger U.S. economy offsets weakness in Europe and Japan.
Policymakers are trying to steer the world's second-largest economy through a soft patch as it also confronts weak consumption and a slowdown in the property market.
Exports rose 9.7 percent from a year earlier in dollar-denominated terms, official data showed, while imports dropped for a second month in a row by 2.4 percent.
That left the country with a trade surplus of $49.6 billion for the month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Tuesday.
The country's combined imports and exports last year grew 3.4 percent, missing the government's annual target of 7.5 percent growth for net trade.
The Ministry of Commerce had earlier predicted exports would fall short, due to negative surprises in the second half.
""We think the negative factors that crimped trade performance in 2014 will be sustained for a period of time,"" said Zheng Yuesheng, a spokesman for the customs office.
China has been long awaiting a turnaround in its exports to be accompanied by a rise in imports, given that much of its trade surplus has been the result of falling imports - more a worrying indicator of weak demand at home, instead of strong demand abroad.
At the same time, falling costs for imported commodities and energy is seen as having mixed effects on the Chinese economy. Lower prices potentially help some manufacturers and service providers, but risk exacerbating deflationary pressures.
Earlier data showed that China's annual consumer inflation hovered at a near five-year low in December, signaling persistent weakness in the economy but giving policymakers more room to ease policy to support growth.
The trade surplus might provide some support for the yuan, but the currency has been on a long slide in the aftermath of a surprise cut to interest rates in November.
That weakness, driven in large part by a rallying dollar and rising yields in offshore assets, has given mild relief to exporters, although the central bank has said it will maintain fundamental stability in the exchange rate. Most economists see the exchange rate as only a minor factor in China's export competitiveness.
Economists polled by Reuters had estimated exports in December would accelerate to 6.8 percent from a year earlier from 4.7 percent in November, while imports were forecast down 7.4 percent, following a 6.7 percent drop in November.
The customs bureau earlier provided trade figures based on yuan terms, but later issued percentage figures in dollar terms."

(Reuters) - Workers who found new jobs in London's financial services sector during 2014 secured an average 18 percent salary rise, reflecting increased demand for staff, data from recruiter Morgan McKinley showed on Monday.
Pay data is politically and economically sensitive as Britain heads towards a general election in May and the Bank of England considers when to start raising interest rates, unchanged at 0.5 percent since March 2009.
The salary jump in the City far outstrips pay growth for British workers in general, which has only recently shown signs of picking up after lagging inflation for most of the period since the 2008 global financial crisis. Recruitment firm Hays said last week it expected wage growth of up to 3 percent for skilled workers this year.
Some 4,620 new jobs were created in London's financial services industry in December, according to the Morgan McKinley London Employment Monitor, up 13 percent on the same period the year before, but down 37 percent on the previous month.
December is traditionally a quiet month for recruitment.
Morgan McKinley's Operations Director Hakan Enver said he expected demand for new staff to continue to grow in 2015 despite uncertainties about Britain's economic prospects and the outcome of the general election in May.
Enver highlighted the demand for compliance staff as businesses respond to more onerous regulations.
""While we continue to also see demand outstripping supply for skilled IT executives, regulatory demands and enhanced reporting needs are pushing compliance to the top of hiring agendas in the City,"" Enver said.
He expects that trend to continue in 2015."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth increased briskly in December, but wages posted their biggest decline in at least eight years in a sign the tightening labor market has yet to give much of a boost to workers.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 252,000 last month after an upwardly revised jump of 353,000 in November, the Labor Department said on Friday. The jobless rate fell 0.2 percentage point to a 6-1/2-year low of 5.6 percent, but that was mainly because people left the labor force.
The drop in labor participation and a surprise five-cent, or 0.2 percent, decrease in average hourly earnings, which nearly erased November's gains, took some shine off the otherwise upbeat report.
December marked the 11th straight month of payroll increases above 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994. For last year as a whole, the economy generated 2.95 million new jobs, the strongest annual showing since 1999.
The softness in earnings, however, is puzzling. Some economists wondered whether last month's broad-based fall, which was led by a record 1.2 percent plunge in the retail trade sector, was a seasonal fluke that would be revised away.
""There is no obvious fundamental economic factor that would contribute to today's number,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""We are disposed to view this decline as a one-off.""
The drop in earnings was the biggest on record dating back to 2006. A separate, narrower gauge posted its largest percentage decline since 1983.
The fall exacerbated a soft trend that has been in place since the 2007-2009 recession. Over the past year, earnings rose only 1.7 percent, the smallest 12-month gain since October 2012.
While December's earnings decline bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to take a go-slow approach to raising interest rates, it did not remove a possible June hike from the table, economists said.
A Reuters survey of big banks showed many economists are sticking to their June rate call.
But financial markets were less convinced. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose as traders pushed back their expectations for when rates would rise. U.S. stocks lost nearly 1 percent after a two-day rally.
The Fed has kept overnight borrowing costs near zero since December 2008.
""We have not changed our Fed call for a June tightening, but it just puts the risks later as opposed to sooner,"" said Dana Saporta, a senior economist at Credit Suisse in New York.
THE GOOD AND THE BAD
All sectors of the economy had employment gains last month and, in another sign of strength, 50,000 more jobs were created in October and November than previously thought.
Overall, the data suggested the economy was positioned for strong growth this year despite troubling weakness in some economies overseas.
Construction employment rose by 48,000, the largest gain since January, while manufacturers added 17,000 workers. Government employment increased by 12,000 positions.
In addition, the length of the average work week held at a 6-1/2-year high of 34.6 hours, suggesting further job gains are in store.
The softness in wages is striking given the tightening jobs market. The unemployment rate dropped by more than a percentage point last year, and is now near territory Fed officials consider commensurate with full employment.
A San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank research paper published this week suggested wage growth was tepid because many firms were unable to reduce wages during the recession and are holding the line on increases in return.
Even so, economists expect to see a spark soon as the labor market continues to tighten. About 21 states are raising their minimum wage this year.
""The wage story should look much better at the end of 2015,"" said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG in New York.
Most of the measures tracked by Fed Chair Janet Yellen to gauge the amount of slack in the labor market continued to point to tightening conditions in December.
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell two-tenths of a percentage point, to 11.2 percent, the lowest level since September 2008.
The ranks of the long-term unemployed continued to shrink in December. Almost two-thirds of the decline in the level of unemployment last year was among the long-term unemployed.

But the labor force participation rate, the percentage of the working age population who either have a job or are looking for one, dropped back to the 36-year low of 62.7 percent reached in September.

There was a bright side to Mike Chase’s layoff. He spent more time with his daughter before she went off to college last year—and his wife is gainfully employed as physical therapist. But the 56-year-old has been trying to find a new job since a series of 2011 cuts at Bedford, Mass.-based Progress Software Corporation pushed him into the ranks of the unemployed.
“I loved it,” he said about his job as a briefing specialist who organized meetings between the company and its clients, a profession he’s had since the late 1980s at different companies, including Hewlett-Packard. “But business doesn’t always go on love.”
In 2010 Progress announced it would trim up to 9 percent of its global workforce, and Chase ended up one of the casualties of the company’s corporate restructuring plan. Ever since, Chase has tried to find work, sending out applications, joining professional networking, even volunteering his skills to help other job seekers. To no avail.
On Friday the U.S. Labor Department said the country’s jobless rate dropped from 5.8 percent in November to 5.6 percent last month, the lowest rate since June 2008. The report showed 2014 to be the best year for job growth since 1999, but as the topline numbers improve, deep problems persist in the U.S. job market. Businesses are creating jobs, but many of them are part-time or temporary positions. At the same time, the number of people who are able to work, but have dropped out of the workforce remains at historically high levels. And the portion of Americans considered to be “long-term unemployed” remains unusually high.
Chase is among them. He’s one of the 2.79 million working-age Americans who have been actively seeking employment for 27 weeks or longer, a number that has been gradually dropping from an all-time peak of 6.8 million in April 2010. Still, the number is more than twice as high as levels seen before the Great Recession.
In an economy that often discriminates against older workers, Chase, in his mid-50s, is at risk of falling from one dire statistical category—the long-term unemployed—to an even more dire classification—those who’ve permanently given up the search for work. In December, the so-called labor force participation rate dipped to 62.7 percent, the same rate as in September when the proportion of American adults participating in the labor force hit a near 37-year low.
""When people leave the labor force, you are slowing growth,"" said Bill Spriggs, chief economist at the AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor federation. ""And this waste affects us all, because we have a smaller economy than we should have. This gap between where growth is and where it could be is in the trillions of dollars, it’s bigger than the fiscal deficit.”
Faith Hendricks, 47, is one of those 93.5 million working-age Americans who have been out of work so long they aren’t included in the unemployment figure. She’s also one of the so-called “marginally attached” Americans in the labor force–people who searched for work over the past year but haven’t looked for work in the past four weeks.
Hendricks hasn’t looked for work since last summer after losing her job in May 2013 as an office assistant at a shipping company in Shreveport, Louisiana. Living in subsidized housing with her daughter who works at a local hotel and casino, Hendricks says she’d be homeless without help from her family and her church that stocked her refrigerator over the holidays.
“My church has been very supportive,” she said. “They’ve given me food, but you start to feel like it’s been too long accepting charity. They say the economy is getting better, but that don’t mean it’s been easy to find work. It hasn’t been easy for me.”
While the unemployment figures released Friday show the U.S. economy is improving and more people are being hired. Economists say it’s only a small part of the larger economic picture. Until more discouraged workers like Hendricks and long-term jobless people like Chase find jobs, the U.S. economy can’t take off.
“There are a lot of workers out there who can do jobs,” says Spriggs. “We’re wasting our nation’s most valuable resource by not hiring them.”

The U.S. saw its largest monthly increase in hiring since 1999, adding 252,000 jobs last month, dropping the unemployment rate by 0.2 percentage point to 5.6 percent, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected net job growth of 240,000 last month.
In November, the economy added a net 353,000 jobs, more than economists had expected and an upward revision from the 321,000 initially reported last month.
Employers have added an average of 224,000 jobs over the previous 12 months. Over the previous six months the average has topped 250,000 jobs added a month.
“At the current pace of job growth, the economy will be back to full employment by early 2016,” Moody's Mark Zandi told Politico.
The average hourly earnings for private-sector workers decreased by 5 cents to $24.57 after increasing 0.4 percent to $24.66 in November, double the average monthly gain in the prior 12 months.
“Today’s job’s report – again – was very strong and shows the labor market is maturing and economy performing soundly,"" said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation, said in a email. “However the earnings data was a bit disappointing.
The healthy jobs growth in the economy won't matter to a significant portion of Americans. For most workers, real wages have fallen or remained flat since the 1970s. Many Americans who work part-time jobs want to work full time, and nearly two-thirds who are able to work have dropped out of the labor force, the highest portion opting out of work since the 1970s. The labor force participation rate edged down by 0.2 percentage point to 62.7 percent.
The number of Americans who have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer was essentially unchanged last month, at 2.8 million, or 31.9 percent of the unemployed.
The so-called U-6 unemployment rate – which includes people who are working part time but want more hours and those marginally attached to the workforce – stood at 11.2 percent in December, down from 11.4 percent in November and 13 percent in December 2013."

(Reuters) - German exports fell sharply in November and industrial output also declined, suggesting Europe's largest economy ended 2014 on a weak note.
Seasonally-adjusted exports dropped for a second consecutive month, dipping 2.1 percent, while imports pushed up 1.5 percent, narrowing the trade surplus to 17.7 billion euros, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed on Friday.
Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a more modest fall in exports of 0.2 percent.
Industrial output decreased by 0.1 percent as construction activity weakened and energy production fell, separate data from the Economy Ministry showed. The headline figure was weaker than a consensus forecast for a 0.4 percent increase.
""Things are certainly not rosy. The geopolitical situation, especially the Russia conflict and the related economic uncertainty, is limiting growth,"" said Alexander Krueger, an economist at Bankhaus Lampe.
He added that while production - which rose by 1.0 percent in the less volatile two-month comparison - probably boosted gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter, the economy was unlikely to have grown by more than 0.2 percent between October and December.
The disappointing figures came after data on Thursday showed demand for German industrial goods declining, with orders plunging 2.4 percent due to fewer bookings for big-ticket items.
Most economists expect Germany to post only modest growth in the fourth quarter, rounding off a disappointing year which saw the economy contract in the second quarter and barely grow in the third.
There have been some positive signs for fourth-quarter growth though. Sentiment indicators took a turn for the better late last year and retail sales climbed in October and November.
Full-year 2014 GDP data is due on Thursday. The government has forecast 1.2 percent growth.
While Germany has traditionally been an export-oriented economy, shipments abroad have suffered this year as demand from weakened euro zone trading partners faltered and crises abroad hurt business confidence, leading to investment delays.
A breakdown of unadjusted trade data showed shipments to the European Union, Germany's largest export market, increasing by 4.8 percent in November compared to the same period last year, while exports to countries outside of Europe dropped by 3.0 percent."

(Reuters) - China's annual consumer inflation hovered at a near five-year low of 1.5 percent in December, signaling persistent weakness in the economy but giving policymakers more room to ease policy to support growth.
The world's second-largest economy still faces formidable headwinds this year as a property market downturn persists and local governments and companies are struggling to repay debt.
""Deflation this year is definitely a risk,"" said Minggao Shen, economist at Citi in Hong Kong.
""We continue to argue that deflation provides more room for policy easing. Our best-case scenario is still two more rate cuts in the first half of this year and maybe three to four reserve requirement ratio cuts this year.""
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected annual consumer inflation to be 1.5 percent in December, compared with 1.4 percent in November.
The consumer price index rose 0.3 percent in December from November, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday, in line with economists' expectations.
The producer price index in December declined 3.3 percent from a year earlier, its 34th consecutive monthly decline and the biggest decline since September 2012, as sluggish demand curbed the pricing power of companies.
The fall in PPI in December was largely because of fall in global oil prices, the bureau added.
The market had expected a 3.1 percent fall in producer prices after a drop of 2.7 percent in November.
Annual consumer inflation was 2 percent in 2014, well below the government's target of 3.5 percent. The producer price index fell 1.9 percent last year.
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) is widely expected to ease policy by cutting interest rates further or lowering reserve requirement ratios (RRR) for all banks, although some analysts believe it may be pausing on policy easing to wait for recent actions to take effect and lift growth.
It cut interest rates in November for the first time in more than two years to lower borrowing costs to support growth. Later, it loosened loan restrictions to encourage banks to step up lending.
China's annual economic growth likely slowed to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter, the weakest since the depths of the global crisis, a Reuters poll showed, suggesting full-year growth will undershoot the official target and marking the weakest pace in 24 years.
The government is due to publish trade data on Tuesday and bank lending data any time next week, followed by data on fourth quarter GDP, industrial output, urban investment and retail sales data for December on Jan 20."

At the same time, he said, the oil price decline will put downward pressure on drilling and on production in North Dakota, where the local economy has been experiencing an oil-driven boom for the past several years.
Kocherlakota also said he believes the U.S. economy can continue to grow even if the world economy weakens, but reiterated his view that the biggest challenge for U.S. growth is whether the Fed will be patient enough before raising rates, a move that could potentially choke off the recovery.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week and job cuts declined sharply in December, suggesting the labor market is tightening.
Thursday's reports support views of faster growth this year, driven by consumer spending, despite a faltering global economy.
""Labor market conditions continue to improve, providing support for consumers and contributing to a virtuous cycle for the economy,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 294,000 for the week ended Jan. 3, the Labor Department said.
While that was a bit less than Wall Street's expectations of a drop to 290,000, the trend in claims remained consistent with a steadily tightening labor market. At current levels, claims probably have little room to fall further.
""Claims have never dropped below the 280,000-290,000 range in the last 20 years, reflecting the reality that a certain number of layoffs is a natural part of the growth/lifecycle of companies even in the best of times,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Millar Tabak in New York.
The four-week moving average of claims, a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, held below the key 300,000 mark for the 17th straight week.
The data helped U.S. stocks rally for a second straight day, while U.S. government debt prices fell. The dollar climbed to a nine-year high against the euro on views the European Central Bank could soon embark on a monetary stimulus program to fend off a recession in the euro zone.
FEWER LAYOFFS
The strengthening job market backdrop could bring the Federal Reserve a step closer to raising its short-term interest rate, which it has kept near zero since December 2008.
In a separate report, global outplacement consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas said the number of job cuts announced by U.S. employers fell 9.2 percent in December.
For the whole of 2014, employers announced a total of 483,171 job cuts. That was 5 percent fewer than in 2013 and the smallest number since 1997.
""This bodes well for job seekers who will not only find more employment opportunities in 2015, but will enjoy increased job security once they are in those new positions,"" said John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Reports on Wednesday showed a jump in small business hiring and another month of solid gains in private payrolls.
The government is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls rose by 240,000 in December after surging by 321,000 in November. That would mark the 11th consecutive month of job gains above 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994.

Overall employment gains in 2014 are expected to be the largest since 1999. The unemployment rate is forecast slipping one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.7 percent in December, which would be the lowest level since June 2008.

A monthly survey by the European Commission showed the economic sentiment in the 18 countries that were using the euro in December was 100.7, the same as in November.
Sentiment among consumers improved to -10.9 in December from -11.5 in November and the mood in the retail sector rose to -5.3 from -6.0 buoyed by the Christmas shopping spree.
In a separate release, the European Union's statistics office said that retail sales in November rose more than expected at 0.6 percent on the month for a 1.5 percent year-on-year gain.
But the economic survey also showed that consumers' inflation expectations 12 months ahead continued to fall, reaching 2.7 against 5.7 in November, well below the average since 1990 of 20.2.
The European Central Bank is concerned that if inflation stays too low for too long, it will change inflation expectations and make consumers hold back their purchases in the hope of even lower prices, triggering deflation.
Inflation in December turned negative for the first time since October 2009 as prices in the euro zone fell 0.2 percent year-on-year, data from the European Union's statistics office showed on Wednesday.
Euro zone inflation has been below 1 percent, which the ECB calls the ""danger zone"" for deflation, since October 2013.
More gloom on price growth came in a separate Eurostat release that prices at factory gates, which show inflationary pressures early in the pipeline, fell 1.6 percent year-on-year in November, its weakest level in eight months, pulled down mainly by a 5 percent drop in energy prices.

Economists expect the European Central Bank, which wants to keep consumer prices close to 2 percent over the medium term, to announce a plan of buying government bonds at its next meeting on Jan 22, to inject more cash into the economy and make prices rise again and stem the risk of deflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell to an 11-month low in November as declining crude oil prices curbed the import bill, prompting economists to sharply raise their growth estimates for fourth-quarter growth.
The economy's resilience despite slowing global growth was also underscored by other data on Wednesday showing private employers stepped up hiring last month.
""The fourth quarter is shaping up to be much better than we had anticipated,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. ""The fundamentals for the U.S. are rock solid and the economy will grow quickly this year even if the rest of the world stumbles along.""
The Commerce Department said the trade gap narrowed 7.7 percent to $39 billion, the smallest since December 2013.
The inflation-adjusted trade deficit fell to $47.8 billion from $50.1 billion in October, prompting economists to raise fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates by as much as 0.8 percentage point to as high as a 3.5 percent annualized pace.
Before the report, many had believed trade would be a drag on growth in the final three months of 2014. Trade contributed 0.8 percentage point to the third quarter's robust 5.0 percent growth pace, which was the fastest in 11 years.
SOLID FUNDAMENTALS
Lower gasoline prices and a tightening labor market are providing a tailwind to the economy.
The firming labor market was underscored by the ADP National Employment Report, which showed private payrolls increased 241,000 in December after rising 227,000 in November,
The report, jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, came ahead of the government's more comprehensive employment report on Friday.
The data, together with expectations of monetary stimulus from the European Central Bank after weak inflation figures, helped U.S. stocks to snap a five-session losing streak. The dollar hit a nine-year high against the euro.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.
Imports dropped 2.2 percent to a nine-month low in November. The value of petroleum imports hit the lowest since August 2009, leaving the petroleum deficit near an 11-year low.
A domestic energy boom has enabled the United States to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, easing pressure on the current account deficit. In November, the quantity of crude oil imports was the smallest since February 1994, while the average import oil price was the lowest in nearly four years.
Lower oil prices should help to temper the impact on the trade balance of non-petroleum imports, which are expected to surge because of firming domestic demand and a strong dollar.
Economists were little concerned by a 1.0 percent drop in exports in November, which was likely related to a labor dispute at the country's main ports on the West Coast.
That dispute has been cited by businesses as causing delays in the movement of goods.

""The falls in trade volumes may be linked to the ongoing West Coast dock labor dispute rather than the state of global and domestic demand,"" said Paul Dales, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London.

1141,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 07, 2015 09:01AM ET</span>","European Inflation Turns Negative, First Time In 5 Years","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - The euro hit a nine-year trough and bond yields in several euro zone countries reached record lows on Wednesday, as tumbling oil prices tipped inflation into negative territory for the first time since 2009, raising the prospect of outright deflation.
Euro zone annual inflation in December was -0.2 percent, lower than expected and far below the European Central Bank's medium-term target of just under 2 percent.
The fall was driven by tumbling energy prices. Brent crude oil futures fell below $50 a barrel on Wednesday for the first time in almost six years, marking a startling decline of around 40 percent in just two months.
""Today's figures pile yet more pressure onto the ECB to deliver a sizeable quantitative easing program at its policy meeting later this month. But it's too late to head off deflation now,"" said Jonathan Loynes, chief economist at Capital Economics.
""Without a rebound in oil prices, energy effects alone could push the headline inflation rate down towards -1 percent in the early months of this year and keep it in negative territory for most of 2015.""
The ECB meets on Jan. 22 but may be reluctant to act aggressively before Greece's general election on Jan. 25, a vote which could raise the prospect of an exit from the euro zone if the left-wing Syriza party wins.
The euro fell as low as $1.1819 in anticipation of more money-printing by the ECB, down a half of one percent on the day.
The dollar fared better, bouncing to 119.10 yen from a low of 118.04 touched on Tuesday and was up a half of a percent against the Swiss franc at 1.0150 francs.
OIL KEEPS FALLING
Euro zone inflation expectations, measured by the ECB's preferred gauge of 5-year forwards, fell to a fresh low of 1.58 percent and government bond yields around the world fell as investors wrestled with the risk of global deflation.
Longer-term borrowing costs in Japan, Germany, France, The Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Canada and Australia bonds all reached record lows.
Yields on German bonds of maturities of up to 5 years were negative and the 10-year yield touched as low as 0.44 percent.
The average 10-year sovereign bond yield across the G3 -- United States, euro zone andJapan -- is below 1 percent for the first time ever, even lower than during the 1930s Depression, according to Citi.
The decline in oil showed no sign of letting up. Brent fell more than 2 percent earlier in the day to dip below $50 a barrel for the first time since early 2009 before rebounding back above $51.
In equity markets the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares was up 1 percent, and the major U.S. stock index futures pointed to a higher open of more than 0.5 percent on Wall Street.
That would break a run of five straight losing sessions, the longest losing streak since late 2013 for the S&P 500.
Minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting are due later Wednesday and should expand on where members felt rates were heading.
Investors pushed back their expectations for the day when the Fed might be able to hike interest rates. Fed fund futures imply no chance of a hike by June and only one rise to 0.5 percent by year end.
Even if the Fed sticks to its current timetable and moves around mid-year, markets are wagering it will be so far ahead of the curve that inflation will remain permanently low.
Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds were steady at 1.96 percent and 30-year yields were up a basis point at 2.52 percent, inching up from the all-time trough of 2.443 percent hit on Tuesday."

1147,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 07, 2015 06:15AM ET</span>","Unemployment At Record Low In Germany, Record High In Italy","By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Germany's unemployment rate dropped to a record low of 6.5 percent in December while Italy's pushed up to a new high of 13.4 percent, underscoring the vast differences within the struggling euro zone economy.
The German jobless rate fell from 6.6 percent in November to its lowest since German reunification in 1990. The rate had been forecast to hold steady.
In Italy, on the other hand, the unemployment rate in November hit its highest since the statistics office began reporting the series in 1977, reflecting the impact of the third recession to hit the country since 2008.
The low unemployment rate also makes Germany the envy of Portugal, where the jobless rate climbed to 13.9 percent in November, and Greece and Spain, where around a quarter of the population are still out of work.
The number of people out of work in Germany fell by 27,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis to 2.841 million. That was a sharper decrease than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll, which had been for a drop of 6,000, and was steeper than even the biggest estimate, for a decrease of 15,000. ECONDE
""The German labor market is robust and should contribute to a positive consumer climate ... and strong growth of private consumption this year,"" said Postbank economist Heinrich Bayer.
But Bayer said unemployment was unlikely to keep falling so fast.
""The weak economy in the winter and the fact the first quarter probably won't be especially good, either, should slow down the declines in joblessness, and the introduction of the minimum wage could also put the brakes on during this year.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government introduced Germany's first country-wide wage floor of 8.50 euros an hour on Jan. 1. Economists are divided about whether it will cost jobs or boost consumption.
Employment is at a record high in Germany and wages are rising while inflation is at a five-year low. All that is helping to boost domestic demand at a time when investment is weak and exports are sluggish.
Private consumption drove growth in the third quarter, when the German economy narrowly avoided a recession after contracting in the April-June period.
Earlier on Wednesday, data showed retail sales rose by 1.0 percent on the month in November and the Federal Statistics Office said they had probably grown 1.1 to 1.3 percent last year in real terms."

Eurostat said inflation in the 18 countries using the euro in December was -0.2 percent year-on-year, down from 0.3 percent year-on-year in November. The last time euro zone inflation was negative was in October 2009, when it was -0.1 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a -0.1 percent year-on-year fall in prices. The ECB wants to keep inflation below but close to 2 percent over the medium term.
Eurostat said that core inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, was stable at 0.7 percent year-on-year in December -- the same level as in November and October.
But energy prices plunged 6.3 percent year-on-year last month and unprocessed food was 1.0 percent cheaper, pulling down the overall index despite a 1.2 percent rise in the cost of services.
The ECB is concerned that a prolonged period of very low inflation could change inflation expectations of consumers and make them hold back their purchases in the hope of even lower prices, triggering deflation.
Because the ECB's interest rates are already at rock bottom, the bank is preparing a program of printing money to buy government bonds on the secondary market to inject even more cash into the economy, boost demand and make prices rise faster.
Economists expect the decision to launch such a bond buying program could be made as soon as the ECB's next meeting on January 22.
""We are in technical preparations to adjust the size, speed and compositions of our measures early 2015, should it become necessary to react to a too long period of low inflation. There is unanimity within the Governing Council on this,"" ECB President Mario Draghi said on January 1.

Inflation in the euro zone has below 1 percent -- or what the ECB calls the danger zone -- since October 2013."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Growth in the U.S. services sector braked in December and new orders for manufactured goods fell for a fourth straight month in November, signs the economy lost some momentum in the fourth quarter.
But with domestic demand picking up, against the backdrop of lower gasoline prices and firming wage growth, any slowdown in economic growth is likely to be temporary.
""The economy hardly ended the year with a bang, but only because the recent pace was not sustainable. It is easing only modestly,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Tuesday its services index fell to 56.2 last month, the lowest reading since June, from 59.3 in November, which had left it just shy of revisiting its post-recession highs.
It was held back as growth across all categories moderated, with some respondents saying a labor dispute at the nation's West Coast ports was causing delays, which required the rerouting of goods to ports on the East Coast.
Respondents were upbeat on prospects for 2015. Wall Street had expected the index to only decline to 58 in December.
The data helped to push U.S. stocks lower. Prices for U.S. government debt rose, while the dollar fell marginally against a basket of currencies.
SUSTAINABLE LEVELS
""The December reading represents a settling back to more sustainable levels, rather than a sign that the economy is beginning to buckle,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new orders for factory goods fell 0.7 percent in November as demand fell almost broadly. Orders had dropped by a similar margin in October.
It revised down November orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - to show a 0.5 percent decline instead of being flat as it reported last month.
Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which go into the calculation of gross domestic product were revised down to show a 0.2 percent drop instead of a 0.2 percent rise. The report also showed inventories at factories barely rising for a second straight month in November.
The weak core capital goods shipments and stock accumulation prompted Barclay (LONDON:BARC)s and forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers to trim their fourth-quarter GDP estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent annual rate.
The economy grew at a 5 percent rate the third quarter, the quickest pace in 11 years. The anticipated pullback in the final three months of 2014 reflects slowing growth in China and the euro zone, as well as a recession in Japan, which are crimping demand for U.S. goods.

While factory activity after the third quarter's robust performance cooled, underlying strength remains. Unfilled factory orders rose 0.4 percent in November. Order backlogs have increased in 19 of the last 20 months.

1163,By International Business Times,"<span>Jan 06, 2015 06:30AM ET</span>",Britain's Services Sector At Its Weakest Since Mid-2013,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Growth across British services companies slowed sharply in December and was its weakest since mid-2013, according to a survey that underscored how the country's economic recovery lost more pace at the end of last year.
The Markit/CIPS UK Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) suffered its biggest decline in more than three years in December, falling to 55.8 from 58.6 in November to touch its lowest level since May 2013.
The slowdown was sharper than all the forecasts by economists in a Reuters poll that had predicted a little-changed reading of 58.5. Still, the index remained comfortably above the 50 mark that signals growth.
Survey compiler Markit said the PMI signaled Britain's economy grew by 0.5 percent in the last three months of 2014, slowing from 0.7 percent in the third quarter.
""The loss of momentum towards the year end will no doubt fuel worries that the upturn is too fragile to withstand higher interest rates,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
Only two of the Bank of England's nine rate setters have voted to raise rates from their record low 0.5 percent since last August. Economists and financial markets have pushed back expectations for a first rate hike deep into this year.
Four months ahead of a national election, the latest batch of business surveys may also perturb finance minister George Osborne's Conservative Party.
Hopes that Britain's economic recovery will become less reliant on big-spending consumers ebbed further last Friday when data showed growth in the manufacturing sector weakened at the end of last year and lending to individuals soared.
While this might be a cause for concern in the longer term, for now the PMIs signaled a decent rate of economic growth.
""It's too early to get worried about a sharp slowdown - after all, the latest PMI reading is still strong, merely down from unusually high levels earlier in the year,"" said Williamson.
New orders at services companies rose at the slowest rate since April 2013 while firms hired staff at the weakest pace in months, Tuesday's survey showed.
However, Williamson said there were signs of increased wage growth, which been one of the biggest disappointments of the economic recovery so far and something the Bank of England has put at the centre of its thinking on when to raise rates.
The composite PMI, which combines surveys of the services, manufacturing and construction industries, also declined to its lowest level since May 2013 at 55.4, down from 57.8."

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2015 05:30AM ET</span>",Euro zone economy ended 2014 in poor shape: PMI,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone economy ended 2014 with its worst quarter for over a year as further price cutting failed to significantly drive up business activity, adding pressure on the European Central Bank to act, surveys showed.
Also of concern to policymakers, the surveys highlighted an ongoing downturn in France and Italy and only a stuttering performance in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
""The weakness of the PMI in December will add to calls for more aggressive central bank stimulus, including full-scale quantitative easing, to be undertaken as soon as possible,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at survey compiler Markit.
Markit's final December Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), based on surveys of thousands of companies across the region and seen as a good indicator of growth, missed an earlier flash reading of 51.7, coming in at 51.4.
While beating November's 16-month low of 51.1 and marking the 18th month the index has been above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction, Williamson said the indicator pointed to fourth quarter GDP growth of just 0.1 percent.
""The euro zone will look upon 2014 as a year in which recession was avoided by the narrowest of margins, but the weakness of the survey data suggests there's no guarantee that a renewed downturn will not be seen in 2015,"" Williamson said.
Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi fanned expectations he would take bolder steps when the Governing Council meets on Jan. 22, saying the central bank stood ready to respond to the risk of deflation.
Risks of a deflationary spiral - consumer price data for the euro zone due on Wednesday is widely expected to show a fall in annual terms - will push the ECB to buy sovereign debt early in 2015, a December Reuters poll showed.
A composite PMI sub-index showed firms have been cutting prices for nearly three years. It came in at 48.1, up from November's 47.6.
That ongoing discounting had only a marginal effect on a PMI covering the region's dominant service industry as it nudged up to 51.6 from November's 51.1, missing a flash 51.9.

And some of that activity was again driven by firms running down old orders. A PMI covering backlogs of work was below 50 for a seventh month at just 47.8, well shy of the 48.6 flash reading.

The reading of 116 compares to a downwardly revised October reading of 129.7. The index was set at 100 at its January 2005 launch, and peaked two years later at 131.7 before plummeting to about half that level around the time of the Great Recession. 
Still, the index was up 1 percent from a year earlier. 
""We don't see this as a sea change or an inflection point,"" PayNet founder Bill Phelan said, noting that the index rose by double digits for most of the year. ""This is a pause more than anything and it's probably pretty healthy."" 
Loan delinquencies held steady at 1.56 percent, separate PayNet data showed, a sign that despite an overall increase in borrowing in 2014, businesses are for the most part repaying what they owe. 
The U.S. economy in the third quarter of 2014 registered its fastest growth in more than a decade, as the Federal Reserve finally ended two years of bond-buying stimulus and began to lay the groundwork for increasing interest rates this year. 
Subdued inflation and lingering concerns over the recovery's staying power mean the central bank is likely to keep interest rates near zero for at least another several months, if not longer.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2015 09:40PM ET</span>","China December HSBC services PMI picks up to three-month high, more stimulus still seen ","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector grew at its fastest pace in three months in December as new orders remained strong, a private survey showed, an encouraging sign of strength even as manufacturing activity slows and the property market softens.
The HSBC/Markit Services Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) picked up to 53.4 last month from November's 53.0, well above the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction in activity on a monthly basis.
A sub-index measuring new business cooled slightly to 53.9 in December from a 2-1/2 years high of 54.2 in November, but remained well in expansion territory.
The labor market was also buoyant. The employment sub-index hit a 18-month high in December as companies expanded. Chinese leaders suggested last year they could tolerate somewhat slower economic growth as long as labor markets remained resilient.
But services firms were not so optimistic on the outlook. A sub-index for business expectations for the year ahead dipped to the lowest level since August 2014, with many firms saying increasing competition was dampening their pricing power.
The robustness in the services sector contrasted sharply with manufacturing surveys last week, which showed factories were struggling at the end of 2014. The findings reinforced expectations that Beijing will roll out more stimulus to avert a sharper slowdown which could trigger job losses and debt defaults.
""The services sector continued to hold up well amidst the manufacturing downturn, providing some counter-weight to the downward pressures on the economy,"" said Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC.
""We continue to believe that there is insufficient demand in the overall economy and more (policy) easing measures are warranted in the coming months.""
A similar official survey released last week also showed the services sector remained strong, with the services PMI rising to 54.1 in December from November's 53.9. That survey focuses more on larger, state-owned firms.
Hurt by a sagging housing market as well as slowing domestic demand and investment, China's economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in 24 years in 2014, with annual growth seen at 7.4 percent.
Some economists have urged Beijing to set a growth target of 7 percent for 2015, compared with 7.5 percent for 2014.
After saying for months that China doesn't need any big economic stimulus, the central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates in November for the first time in more than two years to support growth. It has also loosened some lending restrictions to persuade banks to make more loans and injected funds into the banking system in an attempt to bring down borrowing costs.

While its recent moves may have bought the central bank some time to see if conditions improve, many economists still expect more interest rate cuts as well as reductions in banks' required reserve ratios (RRR) this year, perhaps as soon as the first quarter.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Automakers reported strong December U.S. sales on Monday, boosted by falling gasoline prices, but industry executives and analysts cautioned that growth would slow in 2015 after five years of rapid recovery from the recession. 
General Motors Co (N:GM) easily beat analysts' expectations, logging a 19 percent gain to 274,483 vehicles, the best December for the No. 1 U.S. automaker in seven years. Ford Motor Co's (N:F) December sales of 220,671 were up just 1.2 percent, missing expectations. 
""U.S. auto sales are dancing to a very different (and we believe unsustainable) beat,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note. 
He suggested U.S. auto demand has outpaced economic, wage and housing growth rates, thanks largely to easy credit access for consumers. 
Even as the pace of sales growth is expected to slow this year, modest growth to the 16.7 million to 17 million vehicles seen by analysts is still encouraging, several company executives have recently said. Any deceleration in U.S. growth could be damaging at a time when other global markets are slowing. 
On Monday, Jeff Bracken, head of Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Lexus brand in the United States, said of 2015, ""Any way you slice it, whether it's 16.7 (million vehicles) or slightly below or above, it's still a very healthy industry."" 
Toyota executives said they conservatively expect 2015 sales of 16.7 million vehicles, while others, including LMC Automotive, expect this year's sales to hit 17 million. 
In December, sales of pickup trucks and large SUVs surged, spurred by low gasoline prices. 
Sales of GM pickup trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra surged 35 percent to 81,273, outpacing the F-Series pickups from Ford, which were flat at 74,355 vehicles. Ford's F-150 pickup truck sales remain limited due to the rollout of a new version. 
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA) Ram Truck brand pickup sales soared 32 percent to 44,222 vehicles. 
Auto sales are an early indicator each month of consumer spending. Sales in December rose almost 11 percent to more than 1.5 million vehicles, according to research firm Autodata, finishing in line with analysts' expectations. 
U.S. average gasoline prices are 34 percent lower than a year ago, and in much of the country are less than $2 per gallon. 
Full-year sales for 2014 finished just above 16.5 million vehicles, matching the tally in 2006. Rising demand has allowed automakers to boost prices for their vehicles, however. 
Kelley Blue Book, an industry source for vehicle valuations, said Monday the average transaction price for a new vehicle sold in the U.S. market in December was a record $34,367, up 2.5 percent from a year ago. 
GM's December transaction prices grew 4 percent from a year earlier to $38,816, KBB said. 
Fiat Chrysler's U.S. sales jumped 20 percent in December on strong Jeep SUV and pickup truck sales, but still missed analysts' expectations. FCA's sales of 193,261 for the month were the highest since 2006 for the company once known as Chrysler. 
Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) said on Monday its December U.S. sales grew 7 percent, stronger than expected, while Honda Motor Co's (T:7267) 1.5 percent increase fell short of expectations. 

In addition, Germany's BMW (DE:BMWG) reclaimed the U.S. luxury crown last year, topping Daimler's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes brand by more than 9,000 vehicles.

The final Markit/JMMA Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 52.0 in December, slightly less than a preliminary reading of 52.1 and unchanged from the final reading in November.
It remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the seventh consecutive month.
The output component of the PMI index was 52.5, less than a preliminary reading of 53.3 and slightly below 52.7 in November.
New export orders rose for a sixth straight month but at a slightly slower pace than in November.
The economy unexpectedly slipped into recession in the third quarter of last year as a sales tax increase in April hit consumer spending harder than expected, while exports were uneven for most of the year.
However, the economy is expected to have resumed expansion in the fourth quarter as consumer spending recovered and companies increased capital expenditure.
Late in December, Japan's government approved stimulus spending worth $29 billion aimed at helping the country's lagging regions and households with subsidies, merchandise vouchers and other steps, though analysts are skeptical about how much it can spur growth.
The package, worth 3.5 trillion yen, was unveiled two weeks after a massive election victory by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition gave him a fresh mandate to push through his ""Abenomics"" policies to reflate the long-moribund economy, a strategy which has so far had mixed results.
The government said it expects the stimulus plan to boost Japan's GDP by 0.7 percent.

The government is also expected to start cutting corporate taxes from April in a bid to spur more activity and encourage firms to pay higher wages.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. factory sector grew at its slowest pace in six months in December, a sign that weakness in the global economy is weighing on the United States.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 55.5 last month from 58.7 in November.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, and the reading remains well above its two-year average. That means the slowdown appears unlikely to derail a broader strengthening of the U.S. economy.
""These were readings that in any ordinary time would be considered excellent,"" Guy Berger, an analyst with RBS Securities, said in a note to clients.
Prices for U.S. Treasuries rose and the U.S. dollar was up against a basket of currencies after the data. U.S. stock indexes also were trading higher.
Still, the data suggests weakness abroad and a surge in the value of the dollar, which is near its strongest level since 2005, are inflicting pain on key parts of the U.S. economy. A gauge of factory exports fell to 52 in December from 55 in the previous month.
At the same time, the weakness in global demand also has pushed oil prices lower, enabling American consumers to spend more and boost the U.S. economy.
The economy went on a tear in the third quarter, when it grew at a 5 percent annual rate, and many economists expect a generally strong showing in the second half of 2014 will continue into this year, leading the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sometime in 2015.
""It makes sense that manufacturing activity should be coming off the boil,"" said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics, ""But the strength of domestic demand will ensure that industry and the wider economy still perform particularly well in 2015.""
The data suggested that employment in the factory sector rose more in December than analysts had expected, marking the 18th consecutive month of expansion in manufacturing employment sentiment.A separate report showed U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in November, held back by a drop in government outlays and by less money spent by businesses on projects other than homes.

Construction spending fell 0.3 percent, the first decline since June, to an annual rate of $975 billion, the Commerce Department said.

October's construction outlays were revised up to show a 1.2 percent gain instead of the previously reported 1.1 percent increase. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.3 percent in November.

Financial data firm Markit said its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to 53.9 in December from November's final reading of 54.8. The preliminary December read for the index was 53.7.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in economic activity. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, noted that factories had their best year since the recession, even as the outlook for 2015 is now a bit clouded.
""Companies are citing greater uncertainty about the outlook, especially in export markets, leading to some scaling back of expansion plans and a greater reluctance for customers to place orders compared to earlier in the year, which suggests a slowdown could become more entrenched unless demand revives,"" he said in a statement.
The survey's output index fell to 54.7, a low not seen since last January, from 55.6 in November. The employment index declined to 53, the lowest since July, from 55.1 in November.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - The global economy ended 2014 in a fragile state as factories struggled to maintain growth across Europe and Asia, business surveys showed, adding to pressure on central banks to implement more stimulus. 
Ebbing price pressures across the continents offers room for the People's Bank of China and the European Central Bank to do more to drive up inflation and support growth. 
""Growth really does appear to be stalling based on these indicators so certainly the pressure is on, although we are less worried about China,"" said James Knightley, senior global economist at ING. 
On Thursday, ECB President Mario Draghi fanned expectations he would take bolder steps this month, saying the central bank stood ready to respond to the risk of deflation. Consumer price data for the euro zone due on Jan. 7 is widely expected to show a fall in annual terms.  
""With inflation set to fall sharply further, given what is happening to energy costs, those concerns that Draghi highlighted suggests we are going to get quantitative easing,"" Knightley said. 
The risk of a deflationary spiral, alongside a stagnating euro economy, will push the ECB to buy sovereign debt early in 2015, a Reuters poll showed last month. [ECILT/EU] 
The ECB council meets on Jan. 22 and markets are wagering heavily it will finally decide to start buying sovereign debt, a major reason the euro hit 4-1/2 year lows on Friday. [MKTS/GLOB] 
Euro zone manufacturing concluded last year on a subdued note as output, new orders and employment all recorded sluggish growth. Also of concern to policymakers, activity was weak in Germany, Europe's largest economy, while the downturn also deepened in France, the euro bloc's second-biggest. 
Markit's final December manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index stood at 50.6, down from an earlier flash reading of 50.8 but beating November's 17-month low of 50.1. [EUR/PMIM] 
That is above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, but there was little sign of any improvement this month, with the subindex for new orders at just 50.2, leading factories to barely increase headcount in December. 
British manufacturing expanded at a much weaker pace than expected in December, suggesting its contribution to the economic recovery ebbed further in the final months of 2014. 
Global exporters should get some relief as the U.S. shifts into higher gear, although they did not benefit as much from 2014's recovery in the world's biggest economy as they have in the past. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated it will start raising rates from rock bottom later this year as long as the economy continues to improve and unemployment falls further. 
A U.S. Institute for Supply Management measure of manufacturing is due later on Friday and is expected to show a still strong reading around 57.6 for December.  
ASIA BRAKES 
China's massive factory sector looked to have sputtered in December and across the region manufacturers struggled with weak demand, both at home and abroad. 
China's official PMI slipped to 50.1 in December from November's 50.3, its lowest level of the year. 
While the PMI for China's services sector, which accounts for close to half of the economy, edged up to 54.1 from November's 53.9, many analysts suspect 2014 economic growth has undershot the government's 7.5 percent target, marking the weakest expansion in 24 years. 
With factories able to make more than consumers wanted to buy, the pressure was intense to cut prices. 
""The price measures show very strong disinflationary forces,"" said analysts at Nomura. ""We expect more policy easing in the first quarter, including a 50-basis-point cut in the bank reserve requirement ratio, to shore up domestic demand."" 
In India, too, inflation has slowed to only 4.38 percent annually, the lowest since the government started releasing the data in 2012. 
""With the disinflationary trend gaining ground, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to find space for some rate cuts in 2015,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC. 

In South Korea, consumer prices grew at the slowest clip in more than 15 years in December, opening the door for further rate cuts there.

(Reuters) - Indian manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace in two years in December as new orders flooded in and factories kept price increases to a minimum, a business survey showed on Friday.
Strong new business reinforces Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's view that the economy will grow ""much better"" in 2015/16, while weaker inflation gives the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) more room to cut interest rates as expected this year.
The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 54.5 in December from 53.3, its highest since end-2012 and its 14th straight month above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.
The survey also showed input prices slumped to a near six-year low as oil prices tumbled.
In November, India's annual consumer price inflation fell to 4.38 percent, well below the 8 percent which the RBI had hoped to achieve by the end of the year and the lowest since the government started releasing the data in 2012.
""With the disinflationary trend gaining ground, the RBI is expected to find space for some rate cuts in 2015,"" said Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC.
A Reuters poll predicted the RBI would start cutting its key lending rate from 8 percent in the second quarter.
But despite surging factory production, driven by improved business conditions and strong domestic and foreign demand, factories cut headcount at the steepest rate for nearly three years.

(Reuters) - British retailers are optimistic about their prospects for 2015, with a large majority expecting increased sales and higher levels of employment and investment, an industry survey showed on Thursday.
The British Retail Consortium said 76 percent of retailers reported that they expected sales to improve this year, and 78 percent said they were likely to employ more staff.
Just over two-thirds responded that they expected to increase investment levels.
Weak consumer demand was the biggest cause of worry for retailers, followed by business rates tax, the survey showed.
""The retail industry will be doing its part to drive growth in 2015 -- by investing and creating jobs -- but these efforts will be hampered if serious solutions to the burden of business rates are not found,"" said Helen Dickinson, the BRC's director general.
Britons' spending power has been boosted by weaker inflation, which fell to its lowest level in more than 12 years in November. Consumer confidence has eased since then, however, and data last week showed Britain's economic recovery was not as strong during 2014 as previously thought.
The BRC's survey was conducted in November and accounted for around 18 percent of the retail industry by value."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose more than expected last week, but the trend remained consistent with sustained strength in the labor market.
Initial claims for state unemployment aid increased by 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 298,000 for the week ended Dec. 27, the Labor Department said on Wednesday, after four straight weeks of declines.
""The claims data still point to relatively upbeat conditions in the labor market through some of the ups and downs in the weekly figures,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
While last week's increase was above Wall Street's expectations for a rise to 290,000, the claims numbers are very volatile around the Christmas holiday period.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose only 250 to 290,750 last week. It has remained below the 300,000 mark for 16 straight weeks.
""Companies are not laying off workers for weak demand recession conditions,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. ""This means that unemployment will continue to fall at a fast rate.""
U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were slightly up.
A survey of consumers released on Tuesday by the Conference Board showed households in December were more upbeat than they had been in several years about prospects of getting a job.
The government is expected to report next week that nonfarm payrolls rose 240,000 in December after surging 321,000 in November, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
That would mark the 11th consecutive month of job gains above 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994. The unemployment rate is forecast to dip one-tenth of a percentage point to 5.7 percent, which would be the lowest since June 2008.
Other data on Wednesday showed factory activity in the Midwest cooled in December and a slight rebound in contracts to buy previously owned homes in November, but that did little to change perceptions the economy ended 2014 on solid footing.
The economy grew at its fastest pace in 11 years in the third quarter.
The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Business Barometer fell to 58.3 in December from November's reading of 60.8. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the region's factories.
""While momentum moderated somewhat heading into year-end, the handoff to 2015 growth is likely to be quite positive,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.

Separately, the National Association of Realtors' pending home sales index, based on contracts signed in November, rose 0.8 percent.

(Reuters) - Activity in China's factory sector shrank for the first time in seven months in December, a private survey showed on Wednesday, highlighting the urgency behind a series of surprise easing moves by Beijing in the past two months.
The weak performance will add to the debate over whether Beijing needs to roll out more support measures to avert a sharper economic slowdown or fast-track market reforms to stimulate demand - or both.
The report puts a final sluggish stamp on what has been a surprisingly grim fourth quarter for the world's second-largest economy, which is expected to grow at its slowest pace this year in nearly a quarter of a century.
""Domestic demand led the slowdown as new orders contracted for the first time since April 2014. Price contraction deepened,"" said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC.
""We believe that weaker economic activity and stronger disinflationary pressures warrant further monetary easing.""
The final HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December came in at 49.6, just below the 50.0 level that separates growth from contraction. The number was slightly higher than a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 49.5 but down from the final 50.0 in November.
Total new orders contracted for the first time since April, albeit slightly, although new export orders increased.
Highlighting soft demand, output prices declined for the fifth consecutive month, with many companies surveyed saying they were cutting prices due to increased competition.
This in turn prompted firms to reduce output for the second consecutive month, although the rate of contraction was tiny.
Employment weakened for the 14th straight month, although the pace of job shedding slowed.
Hurt by a sagging property market, unsteady exports and cooling domestic demand and investment, China's economic growth is expected to slow to a 24-year low of 7.4 percent this year, although surprisingly weak fourth-quarter data has some analysts wondering whether that might be too optimistic.
Many market watchers expect Beijing to lower its annual growth target to 7 percent next year, from 7.5 percent in 2014.
Faltering factory output, rising deflationary pressures, sliding industrial profits and increasing non-performing loans highlight the policy challenges facing Beijing in 2015. Authorities need to not only encourage more lending by banks, but also find a way to stimulate genuine demand.
The central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates in late November for the first time in more than two years in bid to keep down borrowing costs and support growth. It has also loosened some lending restrictions."

U.S. single-family home prices slowed in October, following the stronger-than-expected rise seen in prices the previous month. Eight cities, however, did see prices rise faster than anticipated.
The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, which covers all nine U.S. census divisions, recorded a 4.6 percent annual gain in October vs. 4.8 percent in September, signaling annual growth hit the slowest pace in nearly two years. Meanwhile, both the 10-city and 20-city composites saw year-over-year declines in October compared with September.
The 10-city composite gained 4.4 percent year over year, down from 4.7 percent in September. The 20-city composite gained at a 4.5 percent annual rate compared with a 4.8 percent annual rate in September.
Although the index showed that the pace of home prices across the country continued to decelerate in October, the rate of growth slowed less than Wall Street had expected. Analysts had forecast U.S. residential real estate prices to rise 4.40 percent in October, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. In the previous report, home prices rose month-over-month in September for the first time since April.
Las Vegas led the declining annual returns with a decrease of 1.2 percent. Eight cities did see prices rise, however, including San Francisco, Denver and Tampa, which saw prices rise faster in October than a month earlier. Miami and San Francisco saw prices rise 9.5 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively, over the past 12 months.
The report comes on the heels of a series of data recently that revealed a possible slowdown in housing growth, after price growth jumped to double-digit increases last year. Housing starts last month pulled back 1.6 percent, while existing-home sales fell 6.1 percent, to 4.93 million, and new home sales fell 1.6 percent, to 438,000.
But separate statistics, other than those connected to housing, were positive in November and early December, as third-quarter gross domestic product was revised to a 5 percent annual rate, while U.S. unemployment declined to 5.8 percent as payrolls added over 300,000 jobs in November. “After a long period when home prices rose, but at a slower pace with each passing month, we are seeing hints that prices could end 2014 on a strong note and accelerate into 2015,” David M. Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in the report. ""Seasonally adjusted, all 20 cities had higher prices than a month ago."""

The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 92.6 from an upwardly revised 91.0 the month before. Economists expected a reading of 93.0 for December, according to a Reuters poll.
November was originally reported as 88.7.
""Consumer confidence rebounded modestly in December, propelled by a considerably more favorable assessment of current economic and labor market conditions,"" Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. ""... They are more confident at year-end than they were at the beginning of the year.""
The expectations index in December was 88.5 versus November's revised 89.3, and the present situation index rose to 98.6 from a revised 93.7 in November. The present situation index is now at its highest level since February 2008.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's economy shrank sharply in November and the rouble resumed its slide on Monday as Western sanctions and a slump in oil prices combined to inflict the first contraction in GDP since the global financial crisis. 
The Economy Ministry said gross domestic product shrank 0.5 percent last month, the first drop since October 2009. With oil exports forming the backbone of the economy, analysts said the contraction is likely to worsen. 
The slide on the oil market accelerated this month after the exporters' group OPEC refused to cut output, and prices are down almost 50 percent from a peak in June. On top of this, the sanctions imposed over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis have deterred foreign investment and led to over $100 billion flooding out of the Russian economy this year. 
""With the current oil price we expect things to get worse. There is no cause for optimism,"" said Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist for Russia and CIS at ING Bank in Moscow. ""This is linked to sanctions first of all, oil and the panic we saw on the market in December. The damage to the banking system and consumer sentiment will take a long time to repair."" 
The sanctions have severely reduced the ability of Russian companies to borrow abroad, triggering the worst currency crisis since Russia defaulted on its debt in 1998. 
The rouble, which had strengthened on Friday, slumped over 6 percent against the dollar in early trade on Monday in thin trade, although it later regained some of the losses. 
Overall the ruble's weakness will inevitably lead to higher inflation next year by pushing up the cost of imports, threatening President Vladimir Putin's reputation for ensuring Russia's prosperity. 
Government ministries forecast the slump in oil prices will lead to a 4 percent contraction of the economy next year and that inflation could exceed 10 percent. 
FALLING ROUBLE 
The rouble had lost more than half of its value at one stage in December, although it has recovered since then after the government introduced informal capital controls and raised interest rates steeply. 
The government issued orders to large state-controlled oil and gas exporters Gazprom (MM:GAZP) and Rosneft (MM:ROSN) to sell some of their dollar revenues to shore up the rouble. 
Russians have kept a wary eye on the exchange rate since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Hyper-inflation wiped out their savings over several years in the early 1990s and the rouble collapsed again in 1998. 
At 9.00 a.m., the rouble had lost over 3 percent against the dollar and was trading at 56.00 , hurt by exporters scaling back foreign-currency sales after meeting their end-of-month tax payments. 
The Russian currency is much weaker than the 30-35 seen in the first half of the year but well up from an all-time low of around 80 per dollar in mid-December. 
The ruble's slide has prompted huge buying of foreign currency in Russia and heavy withdrawals of bank deposits, heaping pressure on a vulnerable banking sector whose access to Western capital markets is restricted by the sanctions. 

On Friday, Russian authorities also significantly scaled up rescue funds for Trust Bank, saying they would provide up to $2.4 billion in loans to bail out the mid-sized lender, the first bank to fall victim to the crisis.

The initial version of the report published on the website on Saturday, which quoted Minister of Commerce Gao Hucheng, was replaced with a new version that had identical wording but with all the numbers and percentages removed. 
The Commerce Ministry did not answer calls requesting comment on the reason for the change. 
China's trade figures have repeatedly fallen short of expectations in the second half of this year, providing more evidence that China's economy may be facing a sharper slowdown. 
Foreign direct investment will amount to $120 billion for the year, the earlier version of Ministry of Commerce report said, in line with official forecasts. The earlier version of the report also said outward non-financial investment from China could also come in around the same level. 
 That would mark the first time outward flows have pulled even with inward investment flows in China, and would imply a major surge in outward investment in December given that the current accumulated level stands slightly below $90 billion. 
 The earlier version of the report also predicted that retail sales growth would come in at 12 percent for 2014, in line with the current average growth rate. 

In a separate report, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences predicted that real estate prices in Chinese cities would continue to slide in 2015, with third- and fourth-tier cities hit hardest. But it said the market would have a soft landing as local governments take action to provide further policy support to the market.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2014 07:10AM ET</span>",China's November industrial profits suffer sharpest fall in 27 months,"By Pete Sweeney 
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese industrial profits dropped 4.2 percent in November to 676.12 billion yuan ($108.85 billion), official data showed on Saturday, the biggest annual decline since August 2012 as the economy hit major unexpected headwinds in the second half. 
Despite last month's drop, profits for January-November were 5.3 percent higher than in the first 11 months of 2013, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data. 
The NBS attributed November's profit drop to declining sales and a long-running slide in producer pricing power. 
""Increasing price falls shrank the space for profit,"" the agency said. 
It said the impact of prices for coal, oil and basic materials falling to their lowest levels in years ""was extremely clear"". 
As the NBS analysis suggested, the net slide in industrial profits was driven primarily by weakness in coal mining, and oil and gas industries, where November profits tumbled from a year earlier by 44.4 percent and 13.2 percent respectively. 
UPSIDE FOR TECH BUSINESSES 
Oil, coking coal and nuclear fuel processing industries saw their profits slide by 34.2 percent, according to the data. 
On the upside, Chinese technology industries saw profits grow sharply last month. Telecommunications firms saw a 20.7 percent increase, electronics and machinery grew 15.1 percent and automobile manufacturers enjoyed a 16.7 percent gain. 
""This suggests that on the one hand, in the context of weak investment demand, stable consumption demand provided a certain degree of support; on the other hand, promoting industry restructuring is having a positive effect on efficiency,"" the NBS analysis said. 
However, the unbalanced nature of the performance highlights a quandary regulators face. They want to restructure the Chinese economy away from credit- and energy-intensive heavy industries toward lightweight technology products and services, yet they must also avoid causing a crisis in the financial system. 
If Beijing allows mass closures among its sagging erstwhile industrial champions in the name of economic transformation, it also risks forcing a wave of bad loans onto bank balance sheets. That would make banks even more reluctant to lend to the next-generation companies which authorities want them to support. 

Economists are debating whether the monetary easing steps taken in recent months - including late November's surprise interest rate cut - can prove effective in a context where many companies are seeking fresh capital primarily to roll over existing debt amid weak customer demand, while China's most successful firms remain reluctant to borrow.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese annual core consumer inflation slowed for a fourth straight month in November due largely to sliding oil prices, highlighting the challenges the central bank faces in achieving its 2 percent inflation target.
Factory output unexpectedly fell and household spending remained weak, separate data showed, suggesting that any rebound in the economy from recession will be mild and fragile.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes oil products, rose 2.7 percent in November from a year earlier, matching a median market forecast, government data showed on Friday.
Stripping out the effects of a sales tax hike in April, core consumer inflation was 0.7 percent, slowing from 0.9 percent in October and far below the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target.
Sharp falls in fuel and gasoline prices were largely behind the slowdown in inflation, the data showed.
Separate data showed industrial output unexpectedly fell 0.6 percent in November, down for the first time in three months and compared with a median estimate of a 0.8 percent gain.
In a glimmer of hope, however, manufacturers surveyed by the government expect output to rise 3.2 percent in December and increase 5.7 percent in January, the data showed.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stressed last week that Japan was on track to hit the price goal, shrugging off speculation that a recent plunge in oil prices would weigh on consumer prices and force him to ease policy again early next year.

But many analysts remain doubtful that the BOJ can meet its pledge of accelerating inflation to 2 percent in the next fiscal year beginning in April 2015.
The job market continued to tighten, reflecting the recovery.The jobless rate stood at 3.5 percent in November, flat from October, and job availability hit a 22-year high. The number of part-time workers exceeded 20 million for the first time since relevant data became available in 1984, suggesting that companies will have to raise wages to lure employees.
Consumers have yet to loosen their purse strings given slow wage growth. Household spending fell 2.5 percent in the year to November, against a market forecast for a 3.8 percent drop."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, underscoring the economy's sustained strength. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 280,000 for the week ended Dec. 20, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. It was the lowest reading since Nov. 1 and marked the fourth straight week of declines. 
""The labor market is tightening up. Any job losses are just normal frictional unemployment in a healthy growing economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
The report came a day after the government reported the economy expanded at its fastest pace in 11 years in the third quarter and consumer spending increased solidly in November. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims ticking up to 290,000 last week. The prior week's data was unrevised. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher on the report, adding to a five-day winning streak that had pushed the Dow Jones Industrials (DJI) and S&P 500 (SPX) to closing records. 
Yields on U.S. Treasury debt rose to two-week highs. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies after scoring its highest level in nearly nine years earlier this week. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 8,500 to 290,250 last week. 
""What we have seen in the data over the past few months looks favorable for the labor market,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. 
The Federal Reserve last week gave the economy a vote of confidence, lowering its unemployment rate forecast and signaling it could start raising interest rates in mid-2015. 
The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. 
Broadening job gains are starting to spur faster wage growth, which together with lower gasoline prices should boost consumer spending and help the economy weather slowing global demand. 
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 25,000 to 2.40 million in the week ended Dec. 13. 
The so-called continuing claims data covered the week during which the government surveys households to compile the unemployment rate for December. 
Continuing claims rose by 80,000 between the November and December survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate probably held at a six-year low of 5.8 percent.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 280,000 for the week ended Dec. 20, the Labor Department reported Wednesday. It was the fourth straight week of declines in claims.
The report came a day after the government reported the economy expanded at its fastest pace in 11 years in the third quarter and consumer spending increased solidly in November.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims ticking up to 290,000 last week. The prior week's data was unrevised.
U.S. financial markets were little moved on the data ahead of an early close for the Christmas Day holiday.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 8,500 to 290,250 last week.
The Federal Reserve last week gave the economy a vote of confidence, lowering its unemployment rate forecast and signaling it could start raising interest rates in mid-2015.
Broadening job gains are starting to spur faster wage growth, which together with lower gasoline prices should boost consumer spending and help the economy weather slowing global demand.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data.
The report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 25,000 to 2.40 million in the week ended Dec. 13.
The so-called continuing claims data covered the week during which the government surveys households to compile the unemployment rate for December.
Continuing claims rose by 80,000 between the November and December survey periods, suggesting the jobless rate probably held at a six-year low of 5.8 percent."

The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, rose 0.9 percent in the week ended December 19.
The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications rose 1.1 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases, a leading indicator of home sales, rose 1.3 percent.
Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.02 percent in the week, down 4 basis points from 4.06 percent the week before. The 4.02-percent rate is the lowest since May 2013, MBA said.

The survey covers over 75 percent of U.S. retail residential mortgage applications, according to MBA.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2014 02:00PM ET</span>",Third-quarter U.S. economic growth strongest in 11 years,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a 5.0 percent clip in the third quarter, its quickest pace in 11 years and the strongest sign yet that growth has decisively shifted into higher gear. 
Some of the strength appears to have been sustained, with other data on Tuesday showing consumer spending rising solidly in November, offsetting surprisingly weak durable goods orders. 
The reports further set the U.S. economy apart from the rest of the world, where growth is sputtering or activity shrinking. 
""Our economy is firing on most cylinders, whereas the global economy is essentially in dire need of a spark,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. 
In revising up its third-quarter gross domestic product estimate, the Commerce Department cited stronger consumer and business spending than previously assumed. It was the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2003. 
Previously, the economy was reported to have expanded at a 3.9 percent annual rate. Growth has now been revised up by a total of 1.5 percentage points since an initial estimate in October. 
Coupled with a hearty 4.6 percent advance in the prior three months, the economy has now experienced the two strongest back-to-back quarters of growth since 2003. Underscoring the firming fundamentals, growth in domestic demand was revised up to a 4.1 percent pace, the fastest in nearly four years. 
Wall Street had expected growth would be raised to only a 4.3 percent rate. 
U.S. and European shares rose as the data reassured investors that the U.S. economic expansion could buoy the global economy and that recent declines in oil prices to 5-1/2-year lows were a boon for consumers. 
The Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) broke through 18,000 points for the first time and the S&P 500 (SPX) set a new intraday high. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell, while the dollar reached a fresh eight-year high against a basket of currencies and oil prices gained. 
WEAK ORDERS 
In a second report, the Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, were unchanged in November after a decline of 1.9 percent in October. 
Economists, who had expected a strong rebound, largely shrugged off the data, which was at odds with sturdy readings on industrial production and fairly upbeat factory surveys. 
""We think this report paints an unrealistically bad picture of the current orders environment and payback is likely,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
In a third report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6 percent in November after gaining 0.3 percent in October. 
Economists raised their fourth-quarter consumer spending estimates by as much as four-tenths of a percentage point, but mostly left their GDP growth forecast unchanged between a 2.2 percent and 2.8 percent rate, given the apparent weakness in business investment. 
A rapidly strengthening labor market and lower gasoline prices are boosting consumer outlays, which should help to cushion the economy from slowing growth in China and the euro zone, and a recession in Japan. It should also ensure sufficient momentum to keep the Federal Reserve on course to start raising interest rates by mid-2015. 
Consumer spending grew at a 3.2 percent pace in the third quarter, a sharp upward revision from the previously reported 2.2 percent rate, partly due to stronger healthcare spending. 
Growth in business investment was raised by 1.8 percentage points to an 8.9 percent rate. 

Inventories were also revised higher, with restocking now being neutral to growth instead of being a mild drag. But that means inventories could undercut output in the fourth quarter.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2014 10:49AM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales fall for second straight month in November,"WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell for a second straight month in November, a sign that the housing market recovery remains fragile. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that sales declined 1.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 438,000 units. October's sales pace was revised down to 445,000 units from 458,000 units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales rising to a 460,000-unit pace last month. 
New home sales, which account for about 8 percent of the housing market, tend to be volatile month to month. Compared to November last year, sales were down 1.6 percent. 
A report on Monday showed home resales tumbled to a six-month low in November. 
The housing market is being hobbled by a slow pace of household formation, a result of sluggish wage growth. An acceleration is expected next year as a strengthening labor market fosters a faster pace of wage growth. 
Last month, new home sales fell in the Northeast, the Midwest and the South. They rose 14.8 percent in the West. 
The stock of new houses available on the market rose 1.4 percent last month to 213,000, the highest since May 2010. 

At November's sales pace it would take 5.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.7 months in October. The median new home price rose 1.4 percent from a year ago to $280,900.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final December reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 93.6, its best showing on a final basis since January 2007 and the latest in a string of increases since August.
The reading was up from 88.8 the month before but under the preliminary reading of 93.8. It was above the median forecast of 93.5 among economists polled by Reuters.
""Consumers held the most favorable long-term prospects for the national economy in the past decade,"" said Richard Curtin, the survey's director. ""Importantly, the 2014 gains in jobs and wages were widespread across all population subgroups and regions.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 104.8 from 102.7 in November, versus a forecast of 105.1.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations also climbed to 86.4 from 79.9 in November and was above the expected 85.0.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation was unchanged from November at 2.8 percent but down from 3.0 percent a year earlier, Curtin said in a commentary.

1258,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 23, 2014 10:01AM ET</span>",US Economic Growth Strongest In 11 Years,"By Jessica Menton -

U.S. gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in 11 years, according to the Commerce Department’s third and final estimate Tuesday. The final revision surpassed economists expectations for the economy to grow at a 4.3 percent annual pace, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
The upward revision compared with a first estimate of 3.5 percent in October and a second estimate of 3.9 percent last month. GDP increased 4.6 percent in the second quarter, after decreasing 2.1 percent in the first.
""The revision was mainly due to faster consumption growth (3.2 percent versus 2.2 percent),"" Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics, said in a note Tuesday. Real personal consumption expenditures increased 3.2 percent in the third quarter, compared with an increase of 2.5 percent in the second.
However, Dales warned economic growth won’t be quite as strong in the fourth quarter as it was last quarter. ""November’s durable goods orders figures suggest that business investment has slowed significantly, from 11 percent in the third quarter,"" Dales said. ""We still expect fourth quarter GDP growth to be around 3.0 percent, largely due to another decent rise in consumption.""
Following the report, the Dow Jones Industrial Average Futures jumped 52 points, or 0.429 percent, at 17,953.00; the S&P 500 Index Futures gained 5.25 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,077.75. The Nasdaq Composite Futures added 9 points, or 0.21 percent, to 4,300.75.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, was unchanged after a downwardly revised 1.9 percent drop in October. 
The weakness in the so-called core capital goods orders is at odds with retail sales, industrial production and employment data that have indicated a strong undertone in the economy. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 1.5 percent last month after a previously reported 1.6 percent decline in October. 
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, rose 0.2 percent last month after slipping 0.9 percent in October. 
Overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - unexpectedly fell 0.7 percent, even as Boeing (N:BA) reported a surge in aircraft orders last month. 
Durable goods orders have been volatile in recent months because of big swings in aircraft orders. They rose 0.3 percent in October. Orders for transportation equipment fell 1.2 percent last month after increasing 3.3 percent in October. 
Boeing received 224 aircraft orders in November, sharply up from only 46 in October, according to information posted on the planemaker's website. 

Automobile orders rose only 0.2 percent last month. There were declines in orders for primary metals and computers and electronic products. Orders for machinery rose, while those for electrical equipment, appliances and components were flat.

1271,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 23, 2014 06:15AM ET</span>",UK Growth Slows Slightly In Third Quarter,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - Spending by households drove Britain's economic recovery once again in the third quarter despite a slight fall in disposable incomes and weaker business investment growth than previously reported, official data showed on Tuesday.
The economy grew by 0.7 percent in the July-September period from the second quarter, in line with a previous estimate and slowing only a bit from a revised 0.8 percent between April and June.
In annual terms, growth was revised down to 2.6 percent from a previous reading of 3.0 percent, hurt by lower business and government investment and higher imports than thought in an earlier estimate. Household spending rose 0.9 percent from the April-June period, picking up speed from the second quarter, and was the main driver of growth.
The data showed consumers dug into their savings. Household disposable income, after tax and inflation, fell 0.1 percent on the quarter and was up only 1.0 percent on the year, reflecting weak pay growth that has raised questions about the durability of the economic recovery.
Weak earnings have also put the issue of living standards at the centre of campaigning for Britain’s national elections in May.
Business investment, which is considered crucial to ensure the economy continues to grow, fell 1.4 percent from the second quarter and was up 5.2 percent compared with a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said.
Both readings were weaker than the previous estimate for the third quarter. Britain's economy struggled to grow in the years after the financial crisis and, despite a strong recovery since early 2013, it remains only 2.9 percent larger than its pre-crisis peak.
The ONS had said previously that the economy was 3.4 percent bigger than its previous peak but adjusted the figure to reflect revisions to economic growth. The ONS also released third-quarter current account data, which showed that Britain's deficit with the rest of the world rose to 27.0 billion pounds, equivalent to 6.0 percent of GDP, matching the biggest deficit on record."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales tumbled to a six-month low in November after two straight months of strong increases, underscoring the uneven nature of the housing market recovery. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales dropped 6.1 percent to an annual rate of 4.93 million units, the lowest level since May. 
November's steep decline probably does not signal the start of a weakening trend and in part reflected stubbornly low inventories, which touched an eight-month low, giving buyers limited options. Sales were up 2.1 percent from a year ago. 
""The housing market may still be improving, but it is doing so with two steps forward and one back,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Housing has struggled to shift into higher gear after stagnating in the second half of 2013 in the wake of a jump in mortgage rates, which have since pulled back from their peaks, hitting an 18-month low in November. 
It has lagged an acceleration in economic activity as tepid wage growth, a shortage of properties available for sale and higher home prices sidelined first-time buyers. 
November's decline exceeded Wall Street's expectations for only a drop to a 5.20-million unit pace. 
That prompted economists to lower their fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates by at least one-tenth of a percentage point to around a 2.6 percent annual pace, citing reduced brokers' commissions. 
The U.S. housing index (HGX) was down 0.2 percent as shares in largest homebuilder DR Horton (N:DHI) slipped 0.4 percent. Lennar Corp (N:LEN) fell 0.43 percent, while Pulte Group (N:PHM) dipped 0.19 percent. 
TESTING THE WATERS 
But with job gains broadening and wage growth starting to accelerate, first-time buyers are wading back into the market. They accounted for 31 percent of transactions last month, the biggest share since October 2012. 
That was up from 29 percent in October. Economists and real estate agents say a share of 40 percent to 45 percent is required for a strong housing recovery. 
""A fundamental issue continues to be first-time home buyers, whose outlook is improving along with the economy,"" said Jeff Taylor, managing partner at loan processor Digital Risk in Maitland, Florida. Household formation, a key ingredient for a healthy housing market, is running at about 500,000 a year, well below the more than one million that is considered ideal. 
Investors, who had supported the market, continued to withdraw in November, accounting for 15 percent of transactions last month, down from 19 percent in November 2013. 
The inventory of unsold homes on the market fell 6.7 percent from a year ago to 2.09 million. Economists say insufficient equity and uncertainty about the economy's strength were forcing potential sellers to stay in their homes. 
At November's sales pace, it would take 5.1 months to clear houses from the market, unchanged from October. A six months' supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
The shrinking supply lifted the median home price 5.0 percent from a year ago. The pace, however, has slowed from the double-digit growth seen for much of 2013.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2014 12:34PM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims signal firmer labor market; other data mixed,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting the labor market continued to strengthen. 
While other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region braked sharply in December, that followed hefty gains in the prior month and analysts said manufacturing remained on solid ground. 
""The economy continues to run hard as it finishes out the year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined by 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 289,000 for the week ended Dec. 13, the Labor Department said, defying Wall Street's expectations for a rise to 295,000. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, slipped by 750 to 298,750. 
The data came a day after the Federal Reserve offered an upbeat assessment of the labor market and the broader economy, and signaled it could start raising interest rates next year. 
The U.S. central bank, which has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008, lowered its unemployment rate forecast on Wednesday. Many economists expect the first rate hike in mid-2015. 
In a second report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 24.5 this month from a reading of 40.8 in November. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing sector. 
Economists said November's jump in the index had grossly exaggerated the strength of manufacturing and December's sharp deceleration brought it in line with other factory indicators. 
NOISY DATA 
""We suspect that the slump was also mostly noise rather than any signal that, in this case, the global slowdown is suddenly undermining U.S. manufacturing,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
A survey earlier this week from the New York Fed showed a sharp cooling in factory activity in New York state this month. The sentiment surveys, however, are at odds with so-called hard data. Manufacturing output recorded its largest gain in nine months in November, according to Fed data this week.U.S. stocks were trading higher on the jobless claims data and also were supported by signs that oil prices were stabilizing. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. 
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for December's nonfarm payrolls. 
The four-week average of claims rose between the November and December survey periods, suggesting a step back in job growth after payrolls surged by 321,000 last month. Still, December payrolls are expected to come in above 200,000. 
Job gains have exceeded 200,000 for 10 straight months, the longest such stretch since 1994. 

In another report, financial data firm Markit said its ""flash"" services Purchasing Managers Index fell to a 10-month low in December. It is, however, not regarded as a reliable indicator of services sector activity given its short history.

The SNB introduced a negative exchange rate of -0.25% on sight deposit account balances.
The central bank reiterated its commitment to maintaining the minimum exchange rate of CHF 1.20 per euro, and said it will continue to enforce it with the “utmost determination.”
“It remains the key instrument to avoid an undesirable tightening of monetary conditions resulting from a Swiss franc appreciation,” the bank’s rate statement said.“Over the past few days, a number of factors have prompted increased demand for safe investments. The introduction of negative interest rates makes it less attractive to hold Swiss franc investments, and thereby supports the minimum exchange rate.”
Speaking at a press conference, SNB Chairman Thomas Jordan said negative interest rates will remain in place “for the foreseeable future” and added that further measures could be imposed if necessary.“If it becomes necessary, we can take further measures. Possible measures include a further reduction of interest rates or a reduction of the exemption threshold,” he said.""The worsening of the crisis in Russia was a major contributory factor in this development.”

The Swiss franc weakened sharply following the announcement, with EUR/CHF jumping to highs of 1.2094 from 1.2006 earlier. USD/CHF hits highs of 0.9846, the most since August 2012.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest drop in nearly six years in November as gasoline prices tumbled, but did little to change views the Federal Reserve would start raising interest rates in mid-2015.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell 0.3 percent, the largest decline since December 2008, after being flat in October. The CPI increased 1.3 percent in the 12 months through November, the smallest gain in nine months, after advancing 1.7 percent in October.
Fed officials shrugged off the disinflationary trend as transitory in a statement at the end of a two-day meeting. The U.S. central bank offered an upbeat assessment of the economy and signaled it was on track to raise borrowing costs in 2015.
""Conditions could be in place to raise rates during the first half of next year,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The Fed said it expected inflation to rise gradually toward its 2 percent target. It has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008.
Wall Street had expected the CPI to dip only 0.1 percent from October and increase 1.4 percent from a year earlier.
While inflation is trending lower, job growth has shifted into higher gear and the pace of slack absorption in the economy has accelerated in recent months. The Labor Department report also showed average weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, recorded their biggest gain in six years in November.
U.S. stocks rallied on the Fed's vote of confidence in the economy, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. The dollar jumped against a basket of currencies.
Plunging crude oil prices, which hit a new 5-1/2 year low this week on increased shale production in the United States and slowing global demand, are likely to keep overall inflation in check for while.
Underlying price pressures are also ebbing a bit after showing some signs of creeping up in October, but this could also be temporary as the cost of rental accommodation continues to push higher.
Stripping out food and energy prices, the so-called core CPI edged up 0.1 percent after rising 0.2 percent in October. In the 12 months through November, the core CPI rose 1.7 percent after increasing 1.8 percent in October.
""If (Fed policymakers) delay tightening due to low oil prices, it will be out of caution for the potential economic impact,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
""If the fall in energy prices continues, the loss of capital spending by energy companies could cause GDP to fall in the first half of the year.""
Gasoline prices have recorded their biggest drop since December 2008. They have now declined for five straight months. Within the core CPI, shelter costs increased 0.3 percent last month after rising 0.2 percent in October.
There were also increases in airline fares, medical care and alcohol prices. But new motor vehicle prices fell as did the cost of household furnishings, apparel and used cars and trucks.

1319,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 17, 2014 03:25PM ET</span>","Fed leaves rates unchanged, says it will be patient raising rates","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and added it will exercise patience when raising interest rates.
In past statements, the Fed said it would take ""considerable time"" to make sure recovery is underway before tightening policy.
In Wednesday's statement, the Fed left in the dovish phrase though the context of the language suggested that rate hikes are on the way but monetary authorities won't rush to act.
""Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. The Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored,"" the Fed said in its statement, referring to its monthly bond-buying stimulus programs it ended in October.
""However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.""

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the current account gap, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 1.9 percent to $100.3 billion from a revised $98.4 billion deficit in the second quarter. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the deficit narrowing to $97.5 billion from a previously reported $98.5 billion shortfall in the April-June quarter. 
The current account deficit represented 2.3 percent of gross domestic product, unchanged from the second quarter. 
The deficit had declined in recent quarters as the U.S. ramped up domestic energy production, which has reduced its petroleum import bill. 
With crude oil prices at 5-1/2 year lows, the current account gap is expected to narrow in the coming quarters. 
Goods and services exports increased 0.9 percent to $592.0 billion in the third quarter, while imports slipped 0.2 percent to $716.3 billion. 
The surplus on primary income rose to $59.0 billion in the third quarter from $54.8 billion in the prior quarter. 

The deficit on secondary income increased to $34.9 billion from $22.0 billion in the second quarter. Secondary income receipts fell to $27.8 billion from $40.1 billion. Secondary income receipts had been boosted by fines and penalties paid to the U.S. government by foreign entities.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2014 10:13PM ET</span>",Asian business sentiment rebounds in fourth-quarter with India most optimistic,"By Tommy Wilkes
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Business sentiment among Asia's top companies rebounded in the fourth quarter to the second-highest level in almost three years, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed, helped by a stronger U.S. economy and a plunge in oil prices.
The Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index increased to 72 in the fourth quarter from 66 in the previous three months. The result was only slightly below the 74 reading of the second quarter which was the highest since early 2012. A reading above 50 indicates an overall positive outlook.
Indian businesses provided the biggest boost to the index, with companies reporting a maximum score of 100 for the third consecutive quarter as they look to new Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speed up economic recovery.
Corporations in China, where worries about a slowdown in economic growth persist, were among the least positive with a reading of 50, coming in below Japan, which is stuck in recession, at 56.
U.S. unemployment fell to a six-year low in November, a signal that the world's biggest economy and a key export destination for Asian companies is healthier and its consumers are growing in confidence.
""The U.S.'s economic leadership is influencing expectations across the world, and the U.S. is really becoming stronger,"" said Antonio Fatas, a Singapore-based economics professor at INSEAD.
""Asia is a region where there is not massive uncertainty related to political risk. This is a region that grows with the world.""
The rosier picture in the United States coincided with oil prices falling to five-year lows, boosting Asian economies dependent on imports of crude.
Fatas cautioned that uncertainty remained, not least in China where investors and companies are ""sitting and waiting for data"" to indicate how dramatically growth in Asia's largest economy is slowing.
Global economic uncertainty remained the biggest concern for Asian businesses during the quarter, the survey showed, as well as rising costs and other risks such as regulatory change.
""I am surprised that the U.S. and oil prices seem to have outweighed concerns about China and Europe. The downside risks to China's growth are significant, especially related to real estate and shadow banking,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist at Credit Agricole.
Companies participating in the survey included Japanese drugs maker Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd (T:4568), South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries Co Ltd (KS:009540) and Indian real estate developer DLF Ltd (NS:DLF).
The poll, by Thomson Reuters in association with INSEAD, a global management and business school, was conducted from Dec. 1-13.
Of the 116 companies that responded, 51 percent gave a positive outlook, while 42 percent reported a neutral outlook and 7 percent were negative.
AUSTRALIA, TAIWAN UP, JAPAN STAYS WEAK
Oil prices plunged during the quarter as supplies flooded the market while economic growth and energy demand were limited.
Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC, said the fall was a ""big relief for many Asian manufacturing exporters"" and probably helped outweigh continued worries about the global economy.
""There are still lingering risks but the risks are probably manageable. Even though global growth is disappointing, businesses are more optimistic because they see moves toward structural reforms,"" he said, referring to policy changes in India, Indonesia and China.
In Australia - this year's chair of the Group of 20 major economies - companies were more positive. The country scored 85, up from 75 in the last quarter, while sentiment in Taiwan turned positive, jumping to 71 from 33.
The Philippines suffered the steepest decline in optimism, with a drop to 67 from 83, while Japanese sentiment remained poor as respondents worried about the domestic economy.
Positive sentiment among building firms was highest, doubling from last quarter to a one-year high of 100. This was followed by property developers with a score of 87 versus 63, and retail, which jumped to 84 from 63 to its best level since the survey began in 2009.
Shipping and financial companies were the least positive.
INSEAD's Fatas said the oil price fall was likely still being digested by individual Asian companies and would filter through to more positive outlooks across sectors in coming months.

""My expectation is that the next quarter will be better than this one.""

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2014 08:21PM ET</span>","Japan export growth slows, may add to concerns over recession-hit economy","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports grew for a third straight month in November from a year earlier, but much more slowly than expected and despite a sharp fall in the yen as slowing demand in Asia and Europe dampened trade.
The 4.9 percent rise in exports was much weaker than a 7.0 percent gain seen by economists in a Reuters poll, slowing from a 9.6 percent gain in October, Ministry of Finance data showed.
Weakness in exports could compound April's sales tax rise which pushed the economy into a recessionary second quarter of contraction through September.
""Exports to Asia and Europe were weak. Europe's slump caused by Russia warrants attention, but the slowdown in Asia-bound exports was probably a temporary reaction to October's big jump boosted by one-off factors such as exports of ships to Singapore,"" said Hiroshi Watanabe, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""I still expect shipments to remain firm as the U.S. economy continues to help spur output in Asia and Japan. That will be welcome to Japanese policymakers.""
The data followed the Bank of Japan's key tankan survey, which showed business confidence barely improved in the fourth quarter, suggesting a slow climb out of recession despite gains in share prices and a steep fall in the yen.
The yen <USD/JPY> stood at around 117 yen to the dollar on Wednesday, after it hit a 7-year low of more than 120 earlier this month, down about 10 percent since the BOJ's shock expansion of monetary stimulus on Oct. 31. The BOJ is expected to stand pat at a monetary policy meeting on Friday.
Exports to the United States rose 6.8 percent in the year to November, while shipments to China rose just 0.9 percent, slowing sharply from an annual 7.2 percent gain in October.
Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese shipments, grew 5.8 percent in the year to November, slowing from a 10.5 percent jump in the previous month. EU-bound exports fell 1.3 percent, the first fall in 18 months.
Overall imports fell 1.7 percent in the year to November, versus economists' median estimate for a 1.7 percent gain, but still created a trade gap of 891.9 billion yen ($7.64 billion) to mark the 29th consecutive month of deficit.
Export volume fell 1.7 percent in the year to November, the first annual drop in three months. Japanese shipments have struggled to pick up because companies haved moved much of their production overseas, limiting gains from a weak currency.

Yields for U.S. Treasuries held at lower levels, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a lower open also as crude oil prices continued to drift lower. Housing continues to be stymied by tepid wage growth, which has been far outpaced by home price increases. Higher mortgage rates are also a constraint, although they have declined from a peak reached in September 2013. 
The housing recovery also is being challenged by a very slow pace of household formation, as high unemployment among young adults is forcing many to either continue living at home with their parents or share quarters with friends or relatives. 
Household formation is currently running at about 500,000 a year, far below the more than 1 million that would signal a strong housing market recovery. 
But with job growth accelerating, wages are expected to pick up next year and pull in first-time buyers, especially young people, into the housing market, providing a tailwind for the economy. Housing has been a mild boost to gross domestic product so far this year. 
""With labor market conditions continuing to be favorable ... we believe that it will be only a matter of time before the housing recovery shifts up a gear or two and provides a crucial second wind to the economic recovery,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Last month's drop in groundbreaking was concentrated in the single-family homes segment, the largest part of the market, which fell 5.4 percent to a 677,000-unit rate. Single-family starts had posted two straight months of hefty gains. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family homes segment increased 6.7 percent to a 351,000-unit pace. The increase unwound some of October's 9.9 percent drop. 
Multi-family starts continue to be driven by demand for rental units as many financially-strapped Americans shun home ownership. 
Last month, permits dropped 5.2 percent to a pace of 1.035 million units after two straight months of gains. That was the biggest drop since January. 
Permits, which lead starts by three to four months, have been above a pace of 1 million units since July. 

Permits for single-family homes fell 1.2 percent to a 639,000-unit pace in November. Permits for multi-family housing tumbled 11 percent to a 396,000-unit pace. That followed two months of big increases.

The ZEW Centre for Economic Research said that its index of German economic sentiment jumped to 34.9 from 11.5 in November. It was the highest reading since May 2014 and easily outstripped forecasts of 20.8.
The current conditions index rose to 10.0 from 3.3 in November, compared to expectations of 5.7.
“Confidence in the German economy seems to be slowly returning among the financial market experts surveyed by ZEW. This increase is related to favourable economic conditions such as the weak euro and the low crude oil price,” ZEW President Professor Clemens Fuest said.
Separately, the ZEW index of euro zone economic sentiment rose to 31.8 this month, from 11.0 in November, outstripping expectations for a reading of 20.1.
On the index, a level above 0.0 indicates optimism, a level below 0.0 indicates pessimism.

1355,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 16, 2014 03:45AM ET</span>","China Factory Activity Contracts For First Time In 7 Months, Stimulus Expected","By Reuters - 

(Reuters) - Activity in China's factory sector contracted in December for the first time in seven months as new orders declined, a preliminary private survey showed on Tuesday, fueling expectations that more stimulus will be needed to avert a sharper economic slowdown.
The flash HSBC/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 49.5 in December from November's final reading of 50.0 and below the 50.0 reading forecast by analysts.
A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while one above 50 points to expansion on a monthly basis.
The gloomy report will reinforce investors' fears that the world's second-largest economy is losing momentum, and add to bets that more strong stimulus measures are on the cards after the central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates last month.
""The manufacturing slowdown continues in December and points to a weak ending for 2014,"" said Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC.
""The rising disinflationary pressures, which fundamentally reflect weak demand, warrant further monetary easing in the coming months.""
Underscoring the pressures facing China's economy, the new orders sub-index fell to 49.6, the first contraction since April.
The level of output in factories also stayed below the 50 line for the second consecutive month in December, though it shrank at a slower rate compared to November's reading.
The PMI report followed data last week that showed further signs of economic fatigue, with factory growth and investment expansion slowing in November.
China's top leaders said last week that they will try to sustain reasonable growth in 2015 even though the economy faces ""relatively big downward pressure.""
The economy is expected to grow 7.4 percent this year, its slowest pace in nearly a quarter of a century, and cool further to 7.1 percent in 2015, according to a Reuters poll.
To re-energise activity and keep growth from slumping too sharply, the government has unveiled a series of stimulus measures since April, with mixed results.
The ailing property market, for example, is showing some tentative signs of possibly bottoming out, though it is expected to remain weak well into 2015, dragging on broader economic activity."

Research group Markit said its preliminary German manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose to a two month high of 51.2 this month from a final reading of 49.5 in November. Analysts had expected the index to tick up to 50.4.
The preliminary reading of the German services PMI slid to a 17-month low of 51.4 from a final reading of 52.1 last month, compared to expectations for an increase to 52.6.
The composite output index, which measures the combined output of both the manufacturing and service sectors, fell to an 18-month low of 51.4 from 51.7 in November.
A reading above 50.0 on the index indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
“Overall, the data are consistent with only marginal GDP growth in the fourth quarter at best, with the average PMI reading in the latest three months the weakest since the second quarter of 2013”, Oliver Kolodseike, economist at Markit said.
“The possibility of a renewed downturn at the start of next year is clearly becoming more and more likely, especially if the survey data continue to disappoint.”
EUR/USD was at 1.2474 from 1.2464 ahead of the release of the data.
European stock markets turned lower, giving up earlier small gains. France’s CAC 40 fell 0.70%, the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 was down 0.91%, Germany's DAX fell 0.78%, while London’s FTSE 100 slid 0.31%.

The flash HSBC/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index(PMI) fell to 49.5 in December from November's final reading of 50.0 and below the 50.0 forecast by analysts.

""The rising disinflationary pressures, which fundamentally reflect weak demand, warrant further monetary easing in the coming months."" 
However, while economists have continued to call for more easing, others question whether another round of easy credit is what China needs, given the country is still struggling to work off a mountain of bad debt and manufacturing overcapacity engendered by the last round of policy easing in 2009. 
""We expect policymakers to respond to the continued weakness with further rate cuts and liquidity injections,"" wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics in Singapore. 
""That said, we think that those expecting a policy-driven rebound in growth next year will be disappointed."" 
Economists have noted that a surprise interest rate cut by the central bank on Nov. 21 has yet to result in lower financing costs, although the cut, combined with a quiet relaxation of loan restrictions beginning in October, did appear to have translated into a surge in loans in November. 
TWO-SPEED ECONOMY? 
While manufacturing has been weak, weighed down by a cooling property market, tight credit conditions and erratic exports, China's services sector has proved more resilient. 
Other data released on Tuesday showed cumulative foreign direct investment posted a mild recovery in November after four straight months of decline, with investment in services growing even as investment in manufacturing declined. 
The transition to services is a key policy goal, which would help restructure China's economy toward a more labor-intensive and less investment-intensive model that is seen as more sustainable and more in line with other advanced economies. 
But for the same reason, service industries are less responsive to credit easing than manufacturers; firms don't hire more lawyers or programmers just because interest rates are low. 
Thus some economists question whether the China's deepening economic malaise, in which weak customer demand is seen as playing a major role, will respond to a liquidity injection, or whether the cash will simply flow into low-yielding infrastructure projects, speculative ventures in real estate or into a stock market that has rallied heavily on borrowed money. 
REVISING TARGETS 
China's top leaders said last week that they will try to sustain reasonable growth in 2015 even though the economy faces ""relatively big downward pressure"". 
They are preparing to revise their estimate of 2013 gross domestic product (GDP) growth after adjusting the way the figure is measured. 
The head of the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday that the new methodology would revise up the size of the economy in 2013 by around 3 percent, without giving details. The new number will be published on Dec. 19. 
However, the rise in historical measurement is not seen as providing a basis for more optimism about present conditions. 
""I don't think they will change the main assessment of the current economic situation,"" said Zhu Haibin, chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong. ""If they revise up, that means growth in the past several years will also be higher and the slowdown trend is still there."" 

The economy is expected to grow 7.4 percent this year, its slowest pace in nearly a quarter of a century, and cool further to 7.1 percent in 2015, according to a Reuters poll.

1361,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 16, 2014 01:31AM ET</span>","Russia Takes Big Step To Prop Up Ruble, Economy","By Kukil Bora -

The Central Bank of the Russian Federation, also known as the Bank of Russia, has announced that it will increase its key interest rate to 17 percent, up from 10.5 percent, with effect from Tuesday. The bank said that the move was an effort to boost the ruble and rescue the country’s sanctions-hit economy.
The ruble has dropped about 50 percent since January, hampered by falling oil prices and Western sanctions imposed on the country over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. The increase in the key interest rate is considered to be a desperate move by the central bank to defend the falling ruble, which threatens to raise Russia’s inflation to levels that could paralyze the country’s economy, The Associated Press (AP) reported.
“From 16 December 2014 the Bank of Russia Board of Directors decided to raise the Bank of Russia key rate to 17.00 percent per annum. This decision is aimed at limiting substantially increased ruble depreciation risks and inflation risks,” Bank of Russia said in a statement on Tuesday.
Although the decision triggered an immediate gain in the ruble, with one-month ruble forwards up 1.6 percent in Asian trading, some analysts said that the struggling Russian economy is unlikely to manage such high rates for long, Bloomberg reported, adding that the move by the country’s central bank is the biggest rate hike since 1998.
“This move symbolizes the surrender of economic growth for the sake of preserving the financial system,” Ian Hague, co-founder of New York-based Firebird Management LLC, told Bloomberg. “It’s the right move to make, and it wasn’t easy to make it.”
Russia has reportedly spent $80 billion in an unsuccessful move to stabilize the currency, which is now trading at about 65.60 to the dollar. It breached the 64.00 level for the first time on Monday.
According to Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, the Russian central bank has raised the key interest rate to attract investors, but the move will not solve the underlying issues affecting the Russian economy, he added, according to AP. Eichengreen also noted that Russia relies heavily on petroleum revenues, leaving the country’s economy at the mercy of global financial markets, where oil is priced in dollars.
The price for a barrel of Brent crude oil was down 65 cents to $61.20 on Monday. Earlier in the session, it had fallen to a session low of $60.28, the lowest price since July 2009, Reuters reported.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, oil and natural gas sales accounted for 68 percent of Russia's total export revenues in 2013. Earlier on Monday, the Russian central bank had said that it expected the country’s economy to shrink 4.5 percent to 4.7 percent in 2015 -- the most since 2009 -- if oil prices averaged $60 a barrel in 2014.
“If today’s measures fail to stem the ruble rout, there is a high probability that policy will veer in a more unorthodox direction,” Alexander Kliment, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, said in a research note obtained by The New York Times. “Some top advisers to Putin are openly hostile to rate hikes.”"
1362,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 15, 2014 11:45PM ET</span>",India's Trade Deficit Widens Amid Recovery Hopes,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - India's trade deficit widened to an 18-month high in November as demand for machinery and transport equipment soared, bolstering hopes of a sustained recovery in Asia's third-largest economy.
Higher gold imports during the month also helped swell the trade shortfall to $16.86 billion last month, its highest level since May 2013. Gold imports jumped 34 percent from October to $5.61 billion.
Imports of machinery and transport equipment grew about 40 percent month-on-month. That augurs well for an economy which is trying to break out of the slowest phase of growth since the 1980s amid a dearth of investment and slack consumer demand.
It will also be welcome news for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who swept to power six months ago on election promises to oversee an economic revival.
Growth slowed to 5.3 percent in the July-September quarter from a 2-1/2-year high of 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, both well short of the 8 percent level needed to create enough jobs to employ a rapidly expanding workforce.
Also boosting the economic outlook, merchandise exports recovered to post a 7.27 percent annual growth in November. India's exports contribute about 25 percent to its gross domestic product."

Commodity prices, notably those for iron ore and oil, had continued to decline. Members noted that these price developments could be largely explained by increases in supply, although easing demand was also a factor. The fall in oil prices was expected to contribute to lower headline consumer price inflation in many of Australia's trading partners and, other things being equal, lower oil prices were likely to spur higher growth in many economies. Very accommodative financial conditions in the major economies continued to support global growth.GDP growth in China in the September quarter was consistent with the authorities' objectives. Members observed that housing prices in China had fallen again in October but by less than in previous months. The ongoing weakness in housing markets had been reflected in a further easing in growth in investment and industrial production; lower growth in steel production had contributed to lower iron ore prices in recent months. Policymakers in China had responded to weakness in some sectors of the economy and this was expected to support growth in the near term. There were tentative signs that conditions in the housing market were stabilising.In Japan, GDP fell in the September quarter against expectations of a small rise. Members noted that the weakness was spread across most components of expenditure. In contrast, recent indicators suggested that conditions in the labour market had remained tight. Output growth for the September quarter in the rest of east Asia had been around its average of recent years.The US economy had grown at an above-trend pace in the September quarter and the unemployment rate had declined further. Core inflation had increased relative to a year earlier, but remained about ½ percentage point below the Federal Open Market Committee's goal of 2 per cent.Members noted that the recovery in the euro area remained fragile. The unemployment rate had declined a little during 2014 but remained high, and inflation was well below the European Central Bank's target of close to, but below, 2 per cent. Members also observed that differences in growth across euro area countries could partly be explained by the different levels of national competitiveness.Domestic Economic ConditionsMembers noted that the data available at the time of the meeting had indicated that GDP growth was likely to be a bit below average in the September quarter. Resource exports had continued to grow strongly in the September quarter and further expansions in iron ore production were expected to continue supporting resource exports in the near term. Production of liquefied natural gas was also likely to start increasing gradually over the course of the next year. Mining investment looked to have declined in the September quarter and further substantial declines were expected. Fiscal consolidation at all levels of government in Australia was also expected to weigh on GDP growth for a time.The available data suggested that dwelling investment was likely to subtract a little from growth in the September quarter. However, building approvals and other forward-looking indicators of residential building activity continued to suggest that dwelling investment would contribute to growth in coming quarters. Aggregate housing price growth had slowed a little and continued to display considerable regional variation, with housing price growth strongest in Sydney. Members noted that credit to owner-occupiers was growing at a pace only a little above that of income, but that growth in credit to investors was considerably higher.Members noted that the strength in the housing market and data on retail sales, for example, indicated that household consumption growth was likely to have picked up a little from the pace recorded in recent quarters. However, they recognised that the labour market had remained subdued and that this was restraining growth in labour income. The unemployment rate had risen over the past six months, employment growth had been somewhat below the pace of population growth and wage growth had remained low in the September quarter. Forward-looking indicators also remained consistent with expected relatively moderate growth in employment over coming months.Data from the ABS capital expenditure survey was consistent with expectations that non-mining investment would grow modestly in the current financial year. Members noted that a number of more timely indicators of activity in the non-mining business sector, such as the measure of business conditions from the NAB survey, recent data on business credit and growth in profits of the corporate non-mining sector, were consistent with this assessment.Financial MarketsThe Board discussed how financial markets over the past month had responded to the increasingly divergent outlooks for monetary policy in the major economies. In particular, members discussed the effects of recent policy announcements in Japan.Members had been advised at the November meeting that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) had unexpectedly announced an expansion of its monetary easing program at its late October meeting, by increasing its rate of purchases of Japanese government bonds. These purchases were expected to result in a substantial increase in measures of ‘base money’. In gross terms, the BoJ's purchases would also account for around two-thirds of all new issuance of government bonds over the coming year, with purchases exceeding new issuance for bonds with a maturity of 5−10 years.The Board assessed the prospect of an increase in the rate of purchases of offshore assets by Japanese residents following the recent easing in the monetary policy of the BoJ and the announcement by Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) that it would reallocate its portfolio more towards domestic equities and foreign assets and less towards domestic bonds. Members noted that the effect of these actions was expected to result in further sizeable capital outflows from Japan in the period ahead. While the bulk of these were likely to be to the United States, Australia would probably see some significant flows as well, with consequent effects on exchange rates.Members noted that the European Central Bank (ECB) had also reiterated its intention to expand its balance sheet by around €1 trillion back towards its previous peak in 2012 and had indicated a willingness to adjust the size and composition of its asset purchases further to achieve that objective.Overall, members noted that the actions of the BoJ and ECB would result in total liquidity provided by major central banks increasing at a similar pace to that observed over recent years, notwithstanding the Federal Reserve's large asset purchase program having ended in October. Such an expansion could, however, occur against a backdrop of rising US interest rates.Among other central banks, the People's Bank of China (PBC) announced the first reduction in its benchmark interest rates since mid 2012. In part, this was a further step on the path of financial liberalisation, but it also appeared to reflect a deliberate easing in monetary conditions. At the same time, members noted that the PBC continued to restrict credit provision in the shadow banking sector.Turning to foreign exchange markets, members noted the 7 per cent depreciation of the yen against the US dollar, and on a trade-weighted basis, following the announcements by the BoJ and the GPIF. In addition to its marked appreciation against the yen, the US dollar had appreciated a little against most other currencies over November, to be 6 per cent higher on a trade-weighted basis since the middle of the year. Members noted that the Korean authorities had recently expressed concern about the depreciation of the yen, although the won had still depreciated significantly against the US dollar over November and also on a trade-weighted basis. The euro was little changed over the month and remained 5 per cent below its May 2014 peak on a trade-weighted basis. The Swiss franc had appreciated further against the euro over the month to be only marginally below the Swiss National Bank's ceiling. The Russian rouble declined sharply over the previous month to be around 20 per cent lower against the US dollar.In part reflecting these exchange rate movements, over the past month the Australian dollar had appreciated by 5 per cent against the yen and 3 per cent against the won, but had depreciated to a four-year low against the US dollar. The Australian dollar had also depreciated against the renminbi (which continued to track recent movements in the US dollar) to be only slightly lower on a trade-weighted basis than at the beginning of the year, although members noted that the terms of trade and key commodity prices had fallen significantly further since that time.Members noted that sovereign bond yields in the United States and Europe had generally declined over the course of November, with German yields reaching new lows. Australian government bond yields had also declined, with the yield on 10-year bonds falling below 3 per cent and the spread to US treasuries narrowing to its lowest level in eight years.Equity prices in the advanced economies had increased over the past month, with the US and Japanese markets more than fully retracing the falls experienced over recent months to reach multi-year highs. Japanese equity prices had increased strongly following the announcements by the BoJ and the GPIF, while Australian equity prices declined over the month and were little changed over the year to date. The underperformance of the Australian market reflected the poor performance of equity prices of mining and energy companies, which were around 20 per cent lower in response to falls in iron ore, coal and oil prices.Bond issuance by Australian banks in 2014 to date had been solid in both gross and net terms, although the overall funding mix of the banks was little changed. Members noted that conditions in the Australian residential mortgage-backed securities market were strong at present, with high levels of issuance and relatively tight pricing. Competition in the deposit market had continued to ease and interest rates on certain savings accounts had declined noticeably over the past year or so. Lending rates on the stock of outstanding housing and business loans remained at historically low levels.Financial market pricing indicated that the Board was expected to leave the cash rate unchanged at the December meeting, with some chance of an easing in 2015.Considerations for Monetary PolicyIn assessing the stance of monetary policy in Australia, members noted that the outlook for the global economy was little changed over the past month, with growth of Australia's major trading partners forecast to be a little above average in 2014 and 2015. Commodity prices, particularly those for iron ore and oil, had declined over the year to date. Demand-side factors, such as the weakness in Chinese property markets, had played a role over recent months, though expansions in global supply appeared to have played a larger role earlier in the year. Global financial market conditions had remained very accommodative.Domestically, the data that had become available over the month suggested that the forces underpinning the outlook for domestic activity were much as they had been for some time. GDP growth was still expected to be below trend over 2014/15 before gradually picking up to an above-trend pace towards the end of 2016. Mining investment was expected to decline sharply and resource exports were expected to grow strongly as the transition from the investment to the production phase of the mining boom continued. Very low interest rates had supported activity in the housing market, which in turn was expected to support consumption. However, members noted that subdued labour market conditions were likely to weigh on consumption growth and consumer confidence more generally. With spare capacity in labour and product markets likely to weigh on domestic inflationary pressures for some time, the inflation outlook remained consistent with the target of 2 to 3 per cent, notwithstanding some temporary upward pressure from the recent depreciation of the exchange rate.Members noted that the current accommodative setting of monetary policy was expected to support demand and help growth strengthen at the same time as delivering inflation outcomes consistent with the target over the next two years. Despite the depreciation of the exchange rate, the Australian dollar remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices over recent months. Members agreed that further exchange rate depreciation was likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy. They noted that market expectations implied some chance of an easing of policy during 2015 and discussed the factors that might be producing such an expectation.On the information available, the Board judged that the current stance of monetary policy continued to be appropriate for fostering sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. Members considered that the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.The DecisionThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2014 01:14PM ET</span>",U.S. factory production accelerates in sign of economy's strength,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output recorded its largest increase in nine months in November as production expanded across the board, pointing to underlying strength in the economy. 
Factory production rose 1.1 percent after advancing 0.4 percent in October, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. 
""There is little evidence here that weaker global growth or a stronger dollar has hurt U.S. manufacturing,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The upbeat factory data joined bullish employment and retail sales reports in suggesting strength in the economy, even as growth in the fourth quarter is expected to moderate sharply after two back-to-back quarters of robust expansion. 
Wall Street had expected manufacturing output to rise only 0.5 percent in November. The U.S. remains a bright spot in a troubled global economy, where growth has slowed in China and the euro zone. Japan has slipped back into recession. 
But optimism over U.S. manufacturing was tempered somewhat by a New York Federal Reserve report showing its Empire State general business conditions index contracted in December for the first time since January 2013. 
Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the weak report, noting the survey was volatile because of limited factory activity in New York state. 
""With all the discussion about the impact of lower oil prices, it may feel like this miss is a warning that the factory sector is retrenching,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""We are not convinced is what the numbers are telling us."" 
A third report showed homebuilder sentiment ebbed in December, though builders remained more optimistic than in the first half of the year. 
BROAD GAINS 
The reports came a day before Federal Reserve officials gather for a two-day meeting to assess the economy's health and deliberate on monetary policy. 
Economists expect the U.S. central bank to open the door a bit wider to interest rate hikes next year after the recent run of bullish data. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the mixed data as investors kept a wary eye on oil prices, which hit fresh 5-1/2 year lows. 
Manufacturing output in November was led by a 5.1 percent jump in automobile production after three straight months of decline. There were also solid gains in machinery, apparel and leather, and petroleum and coal products. 
Mining output slipped 0.1 percent. Utilities production jumped 5.1 percent as a cold snap boosted demand for utilities, prompting forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers to raise its fourth-quarter growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.6 percent annual rate. 
Strong manufacturing and utilities output combined to lift overall industrial production by 1.3 percent in November, the largest increase since May 2010. 
The amount of manufacturing capacity in use last month rose to its highest since December 2007. Overall industrial capacity use hit its highest level in more than 6-1/2 years. 
""This could be seen as an indication of accelerating resource slack absorption in the U.S. economy,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to run before it becomes inflationary.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2014 08:06PM ET</span>","BOJ survey shows Japan business mood fragile, makes Abe's task harder","By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence among Japanese manufacturers worsened slightly in the fourth quarter and firms expect conditions to deteriorate more, highlighting the challenges premier Shinzo Abe faces in reviving the economy a day after his big win in Sunday's snap election.
The headline index measuring big manufacturers' sentiment stood at plus 12, down 1 point from three months ago and worse than a median market forecast of plus 13, the Bank of Japan's closely-watched ""tankan"" survey showed on Monday.
Big manufacturers expect their sentiment index to fall to plus 9 in March, partly showing companies are concerned that Abe and the BOJ's efforts to weaken the yen are pushing up import costs too much.
The sentiment among big service-sector firms improved, the survey showed, suggesting consumer spending is gradually recovering from a sales tax hike in April.
However, underlining the patchy economic recovery after Japan's slip into recesssion in the third quarter, non-manufacturers expect business conditions to worsen slightly three months ahead.
""The decline in sentiment at manufacturers shows some companies are worried about the yen weak pushing up input costs,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
""Capital expenditure plans are healthy and sentiment at non-manufacturers is improving, which suggests the economy can continue to recover gradually.""
Abe's election win gives him a fresh mandate to pursue policies aimed at ending 15 years of deflation and sparking durable growth.
That task became even more stiff after the economy unexpectedly slipped into recession in the third quarter due partly to the hit from the April tax hike.
Inflation is currently running at 0.9 percent, lagging the BOJ's 2 percent goal which it wants to hit in the fiscal year starting April 2015.
But Japan has little room to deploy massive fiscal stimulus given its huge public debt, while the central bank is already aggressively printing money under its quantitative easing program launched in April last year and expanded in October.
Policymakers hope that big manufacturers, which saw profits boom thanks to the weak yen and sliding oil prices, will spend more on wages and capital expenditure, helping to broaden the economic recovery.

The tankan showed big companies plan to increase capital expenditure by 8.9 percent in the fiscal year ending in March 2015, compared with a median forecast of a 8.0 percent rise.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2014 09:04AM ET</span>","U.S. producer prices fall, signal weak inflation pressures","By Jason Lange
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices fell in November and were muted even outside of energy, a sign of weak inflationary pressure that could point to persistent slack in the economy.
The Labor Department said on Friday its producer price index for final demand dropped 0.2 percent, a sharper fall than expected.
A plunge in gasoline prices drove the decline.
But a core measure of producer inflation, which excludes food, energy and trade services, was flat. That could be worrisome for Federal Reserve policymakers who are expected to debate next week whether to keep a pledge that borrowing costs will stay at rock bottom for a ""considerable time.""
When compared to a year earlier, that core index was up just 1.5 percent, and the annual reading has been dropping a tenth of a point each month since September.
Another core reading that only strips out food and energy was also flat on the month and up 1.8 percent from November 2013.
Fed officials largely view the current low inflation environment as transitory and believe the likelihood of inflation running persistently below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target has diminished somewhat since early this year.
The drop in gasoline prices, for example, could prove temporary. Moreover, cheaper gas helps the economy by letting families spend more on other things and early data on retail spending in November has pointed to strengthening consumer demand.
The data did not appear to have much impact on Wall Street trading. Yields on government debt held to lower levels, and stock index futures pointed to a lower open after data indicated a softening in China's economy.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2014 04:38AM ET</span>","China's factory and investment growth flagging, more stimulus seen","By Xiaoyi Shao and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy showed further signs of fatigue in November, with factory output growth slowing more than expected and growth in investment near a 13-year low, putting pressure on policymakers to unveil fresh stimulus measures.
In a sign that banks were already responding to Beijing's instructions to reflate the economy, however, new lending jumped 56 percent in the month.
Weighed down by a sagging housing market, China's economic growth had already weakened to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, so November's soft factory and investment figures suggest full-year growth will miss Beijing's 7.5 percent target and mark the weakest expansion in 24 years.
""The data bodes ill for GDP growth in the fourth quarter, which is bound to slow further,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
Growth in real estate investment also slipped for the first 11 months of 2014, though property sales registered their best month this year, buoyed by Beijing's efforts to revive a sector on which so much of the economy depends.
After September's move to cut mortgage rates and downpayments for some home buyers, the People's Bank of China cut interest rates on Nov. 21 for the first time in two years.
The surprise rate cut signaled policymakers' growing concern that a sharper slowdown in the economy would raise the risk of job losses and loan defaults.
Factory output rose 7.2 percent in November from a year earlier, down from October's 7.7 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday, and missing analysts' forecasts of 7.5 percent.
Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of growth, grew 15.8 percent in the first 11 months from the same period last year, slipping from 15.9 percent in the first 10 months.
FREER LENDING
The rise in new loans comes after sources told Reuters on Thursday that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) had instructed banks to lend more and had quietly relaxed the enforcement of loan-to-deposit ratios to further that end.
""The lending numbers give hope that investment will pick up now that there is more funds available to pay for capital spending projects,"" said Kowalczyk.
Not all the new lending is being put to productive use, however, as some will just replace existing debt, and there is evidence that speculators are ploughing some of it into a wild stock market rally of recent weeks.
Other data this week showed China's export growth slowed sharply in November, while imports unexpectedly shrank.
And despite the resulting expansion in the money supply, consumer inflation hit a five-year low, stoking expectations that Beijing may move more aggressively to stave off deflation, including a cut to banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR), which would allow them to lend still more.
""We're ready for an RRR cut at any point. We think there will be 100 basis points of cuts over the next couple of quarters,"" said Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING in Singapore.
The closure of many factories in northern China early in November to reduce air pollution as Asia-Pacific leaders met in Beijing likely curbed industrial output, but demand for products such as concrete and steel was also hit by slackening growth in export orders and the cooling housing market.
A bright spot in November was retail sales, where growth ticked up to 11.7 percent from 11.5 percent in October, which was the slowest pace since early 2006.
Analysts expect further interventions by Beijing in 2015 after top leaders at the annual Central Economic Work Conference on Thursday pledged to make fiscal policy ""more forceful"" while keeping monetary policy ""not too tight or too loose"".

Economists who advise the government have recommended that China lower its economic growth target to around 7 percent in 2015.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy showed further signs of fatigue in November, with factory growth slowing more than expected and investment expansion hovering near a 13-year low, putting pressure on policymakers to unveil stronger stimulus measures. 
A deluge of weak data this week has reinforced the view that annual economic growth may weaken further from 7.3 percent in the third quarter - already the lowest since the great financial crisis and further straining the fragile global economy. 
A surprise interest rate cut by China's central bank last month signaled policymakers' growing concern that the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharper slowdown that could fuel job losses and debt defaults. 
""The data bodes ill for GDP growth in the fourth quarter, which is bound to slow further,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong. 
""It will put pressure on policymakers to ease monetary stance again and we expect an RRR cut still in December,"" he said, referring to a reduction in banks' required reserve ratios (RRR) which would, in theory, encourage more lending. 
Factory output rose 7.2 percent in November from a year earlier, slowing from October's 7.7 percent, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday. 
The reading missed analysts' forecasts of 7.5 percent and marked the second lowest expansion since the depths of the global crisis in December 2008. 
The closure of many factories in northern China early in November to reduce air pollution as Asia-Pacific leaders met in Beijing was no doubt partly to blame for the weaker-than-expected output. But recent surveys have also shown slackening growth in export orders while a cooling housing market is weighing on domestic demand for products from concrete to steel. 
Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of growth, grew 15.8 percent in the first 11 months from the same year-ago period, in line with market expectations but slowing from a 15.9 percent rise in the first 10 months and hovering near a 13-year low. 
Other data showed growth in real estate investment slowed to 11.9 percent in the first 11 months of 2014 from 12.4 percent in the January-October period. 
Highlighting overall economic sluggishness, power generation rose a scant 0.6 percent from a year earlier, the third straight month of deceleration. 
Consumption was the only bright spot, with retail sales growth quickening slightly to 11.7 percent from 11.5 percent in October, which was the slowest pace since early 2006. 
The authorities will try to sustain a reasonable pace of growth in 2015 even though the economy faces relatively big downward pressure, top leaders said after the annual Central Economic Work Conference on Thursday. 
The property downturn is expected to last well into next year due to a massive inventory of unsold homes, though further price declines could ease if authorities can persuade risk-averse banks to lower mortgage rates. 
Data earlier this week China's trade performance faltered in November while consumer inflation hit a five-year low, stoking expectations that Beijing may move more aggressively to head off the risk of deflation. 
Analysts expect the central bank to cut interest rates further and lower banks' reserve requirement ratios. The government also could accept a wider 2015 budget deficit to spur spending. 
""We're ready for an RRR cut at any point. We think there will be 100 basis points of cuts over the next couple of quarters,"" said Tim Condon, head of research Asia at ING in Singapore, though he sees no further interest rate cuts. 
Full-year growth is on track to undershoot the government's 7.5 percent target and mark the weakest expansion in 24 years.

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 01:07PM ET</span>",Solid U.S. retail sales point to firming economic recovery,"By Michael Flaherty
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jack Reed can see the recovery taking hold at his family's 109-year-old clothing store in Tupelo, Mississippi, with sales buoyed in part by the paychecks tied to a Toyota plant up the road and rising confidence that the jobs are here to stay.
As retailers nationwide reported a brisk jump in November sales and optimism about the holiday season, Reed said on Thursday that the gears of the U.S. economy seemed to have finally meshed.
""There is just less fear from people who feel like they might lose their jobs ... Our shoppers seem more confident than they did a year ago,"" said Reed, 63, whose chain of four stores clocked a roughly 10 percent jump in sales from Thanksgiving to this week, compared to the year before.
In a rural area that counts Elvis Presley among its native sons, the drop in gasoline prices also was leaving more money in people's pockets.
November's retail advance showed the holiday shopping season was off to a strong start, and dispelled the gloom from a drop in Black Friday weekend commerce. Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, has traditionally been seen as the kickoff for holiday sales, but analysts say consumers have shifted spending through the month and are doing more shopping online.
Coupled with strong job reports and signals of upcoming wage growth, the sales data could boost confidence in the durability of the recovery as the Federal Reserve debates when and how fast to raise U.S. interest rates.
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, increased 0.6 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in October, the Commerce Department reported. The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. November's increase exceeded Wall Street's expectations for a 0.4 percent gain.
It also suggested that consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was accelerating in the fourth quarter after slowing in the July-September period.
Core November sales were up 4.4 percent from a year earlier, the largest year-over-year increase since early 2012. Over the past 20 years, the average change in December sales is close to the average change in November, and analysts said they expected last month's momentum to continue.
The National Retail Federation said the November result supported its expectation for an overall 4.1 percent jump in holiday season sales - confirming its conclusion that the poor Black Friday showing was a result of a shift in shopping patterns rather than a sign of weakness.
Economists at Macroeconomic Advisers boosted their forecast for fourth-quarter economic growth by three-tenths of a percentage point to an annualized rate of 2.4 percent, on the ""unexpected strength"" in consumer spending. Initial estimates of prior months' consumer spending were also revised upward.
The gains were broad-based. Sales for clothing stores like Reed's grew a particularly strong 1.2 percentage points over the prior month, while electronics and appliance outlets saw a sizable 0.9 percent gain.
Even gasoline stations recorded a better-than-expected result, declining a less-than-anticipated 0.8 percent. Gasoline prices have dropped an average of 67 cents per gallon since the start of the year, saving consumers tens of billions of dollars at the pump.
""Perhaps there was an offsetting volume effect, or gas station visitors just spent the extra money on corn nuts, beef jerky and hood ornaments,"" RBS Securities economist Guy Berger said.

1405,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",Declining Gas Prices Help Consumers Pick Up Retail Spending ,"By Jessica Menton -

Following mixed reviews of initial Black Friday and Thanksgiving weekend sales, data on Thursday revealed that consumers picked up spending last month, boosted by a drop in gasoline prices. Retail sales jumped 0.7 percent, to $449.3 billion, from October, and 4.9 percent above the same period a year ago, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
Auto and other motor vehicle dealers increased 9.5 percent from November 2013, and nonstore retailers climbed 8.7 percent from last year. Retail sales, excluding automobiles and gasoline, which are considered to be volatile, rose 0.6 percent last month after an unrevised 0.5 percent rise in October.
Economists view retail sales as a key economic indicator since consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Initial retail sales over Thanksgiving weekend painted a mixed picture for the U.S. economy after overall shopper traffic from Thanksgiving Day through Sunday, Nov. 30 dropped 5.2 percent from 2013, according to the National Retail Federation’s Thanksgiving Weekend Spending Survey.
But global oil prices have declined by more than 40 percent over the past six months, peeking at $115 a barrel in June and down to $64 in December. The recent drop has also sent the price of U.S. crude oil down to $60 a barrel in December, a five-year low, which has helped send the average price of gasoline down to $2.63 per gallon across America, according to Gasbuddy.com.
“The 0.7 percent month-over-month rise in U.S. retail sales in November is even better than we expected and shows we were right to dismiss all those reports about how weak holiday sales were. The truth is that the rises in employment and real incomes have allowed households to spend freely at the start of the holiday shopping season,” Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.
Total sales for the September-through-November 2014 period were up 4.7 percent from the same period a year ago. The September-to-October 2014 percentage change was revised from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent. Economists had expected retail sales to increase 0.3 percent last month, and excluding motor vehicle and gas, Wall Street had forecast sales to decline 0.2 percent last month, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
""Overall, the clear strengthening in underlying retail sales shows that retailers and the wider economy are starting to benefit from the rapid rises in employment and the boost to real incomes from lower gasoline prices,"" Dales said."
1406,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2014 08:40AM ET</span>",Solid U.S. retail sales point to brisk consumer spending,"WASHINGTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending advanced at a brisk clip in November as lower gasoline prices gave the holiday shopping season a boost, offering the latest sign of underlying momentum in the economy.
The Commerce Department said on Thursday retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services increased 0.6 percent last month after an unrevised 0.5 percent rise in October.
The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected core retail sales to rise 0.4 percent last month.
Last month's increase suggested consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was accelerating in the fourth quarter after slowing a bit in the July-September period.
It added to November's bullish employment report in painting a fairly upbeat picture of the economy, despite a recession in Japan and faltering growth in the euro zone, China and major emerging markets.
Core sales last month were lifted by a 1.2 percent jump in receipts at clothing stores, an indication that the holiday shopping season got off to a solid start, with retailers offering discounts to attract shoppers.
Receipts at online stores increased 1.0 percent. Sales at electronic and appliance stores advanced 0.9 percent, while receipts at furniture stores rose 0.5 percent. Sales at sporting goods stores rose as did receipts at health and personal care stores.
While declining gasoline prices are stimulating consumer spending, they weighed on service station sales, with receipts falling 0.8 percent.
That decline was, however, offset by a 1.7 percent surge in automobile sales, which helped to lift overall retail sales by 0.7 percent in November. That was the largest gain since March and followed an upwardly revised 0.5 percent increase in October.
Economists had expected retail sales to rise 0.4 percent in November.

(Reuters) - British house prices grew at their slowest rate in a year and a half during the past three months, a property industry body said on Thursday, but a planned cut to property taxes is likely to temper the lull in sales.
The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors said its monthly house price index sank to +13 in November, down from +20 in October and its lowest level since May 2013, when Britain's housing market started to pick up strongly.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index, which measures surveyors' view of price trends over the preceding three months, to drop less sharply to +17.
Britain's housing market has been slowing since the middle of this year, due to tighter mortgage regulation and annual price rises of more than 10 percent that have far outstripped meager wage growth.
But RICS saw the potential for a boost from tax changes announced last week by finance minister George Osborne which, he said, will result in lower payments of the stamp duty tax for more than 90 percent of home buyers.
""The stamp duty reform could reverse the softer trend in buyer enquiries that has been visible in recent months,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS.
Surveyors on average expected the change to increase transactions by between 2 and 5 percent next year and raise the supply of homes for sale, RICS said.

Inflation remains below target in most of the advanced economies due to spare capacity and declining commodity prices. Monetary policy is expected to remain very supportive for some time.New Zealand’s economic growth is running at an annual rate of around 3½ percent. While dairy prices have declined sharply, domestic demand has retained momentum, supported by the ongoing growth in consumption and construction activity. Interest rates are low by historical standards and continue to support domestic demand. The exchange rate does not reflect the decline in export prices this year and remains unjustifiably and unsustainably high. We expect to see a further significant depreciation.CPI inflation remains modest, at 1 percent in the year to September. Weak global inflation, falls in international oil prices and the high exchange rate are the main influences. Inflation in the non-tradeables sector remains subdued with capacity pressures having less impact than usual.Growth is expected to remain at or above trend through 2016, with unemployment continuing to decline. Modest inflation pressures suggest the expansion can be sustained for longer than previously expected with a more gradual increase in interest rates. Underpinning this, the economy’s productive capacity is being boosted by high labour force participation, strong net immigration and continued investment growth.Risks to the growth outlook include dairy prices, which are expected to recover in 2015, the overvalued exchange rate, and the strength of construction activity. Inflation risks include the impact of rising capacity pressures on domestic inflation, the response of house prices to the strong migration inflows, and the impact of lower oil prices.With output projected to grow at or above capacity, CPI inflation is expected to approach the 2 percent midpoint of the Reserve Bank’s target range in the latter part of the forecast period. Some further increase in the OCR is expected to be required at a later stage. Further policy adjustments will depend on data emerging over the assessment period.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2014 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. third-quarter growth likely to be revised higher on services data,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth was likely stronger in the third quarter than previously reported, according to data on Wednesday that showed spending on services expanding at a brisk clip. 
The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, showed services outlays increased much more vigorously than the government had assumed in its second estimate of gross domestic product published in November. 
""This increased services spending suggests there is greater traction in the economy than was previously assumed and that despite global growth concerns, domestic demand is exhibiting solid forward momentum,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Economists said the data suggested third-quarter consumer spending could be raised by at least two-tenths of a percentage point from a 2.2 percent annual rate when the government publishes its third estimate later this month. 
That combined with data on wholesale inventories and construction spending could see third-quarter GDP revised up to at least a 4.6 percent annual pace from the 3.9 percent rate reported last month. 
""This upward revision implies slightly stronger momentum for services consumption heading into the fourth quarter, but is of little significance to our forecast for fourth-quarter GDP growth,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. 
Fourth-quarter growth estimates are currently converging around a 2.5 percent pace. 
The QSS, which provides a comprehensive count of service sector revenues, is frequently a source of GDP revisions. It showed broad-based increases in services spending during the third quarter, with big gains in healthcare, legal and software. 
According to economists, the QSS data showed the government had underestimated healthcare spending by about $3.8 billion. 
With the introduction of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare restructuring law at the start of this year, healthcare spending has been particularly tough to estimate. 

Growth estimates could shift again on Thursday, with the release of business inventory data for October, especially if September's figures are revised.

Employers outside of the farming sector had 4.83 million jobs waiting to be filled during the month, up from 4.69 million in September, the Labor Department said on Tuesday. 
Job openings across the U.S. economy have increased sharply since April, and the number of open slots in October was just shy of the 4.85 million jobs available in August, which was the highest reading since 2001. 
While employers haven't been as quick to actually fill those openings, the increase in postings in recent months has coincided with other positive economic news that has made analysts more confident the economy is accelerating. 

The number of available jobs could be making workers more confident to leave their current workplaces. The share of total employees opting to quit their jobs was 1.9 percent in October. That's a tenth of a point lower than in September, but this rate has also increased in recent months and now is at roughly the same level it was just before the 2007-09 recession.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2014 12:02PM ET</span>",Solid U.S. wholesale inventories data seen boosting growth,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories rose more than expected in October, prompting some economists to raise their growth forecasts for the fourth quarter. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories increased 0.4 percent, despite an energy price-related decline in the value of petroleum stocks. September's wholesale stocks were revised up to show a 0.4 percent gain. 
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component that goes into the calculation of GDP -wholesale stocks excluding autos - increased 0.6 percent. 
Barclays raised its fourth-quarter growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to an annual pace of 2.5 percent. The economy grew at a 3.9 percent pace in the third quarter, with inventories acting as a mild drag. 
However, the upward revision to overall wholesale stocks in September suggested third-quarter GDP growth would be raised by at least 0.1 percentage point when the government publishes its second revision of the data later this month, economists said. 
JPMorgan cautioned that the apparent strong inventory accumulation in the third quarter posed a downside risk to GDP growth estimates in the final three months of the year. 
Wall Street had expected wholesale inventories to rise only 0.2 percent in October following a previously reported 0.3 percent increase in September. 
Stocks at wholesalers in October were lifted by increases in inventories of electrical goods, machinery, apparel, metals and other products. Auto inventories fell 1.4 percent, the largest decline in a year. 
That reflected strong auto sales at dealerships in October and followed September's 0.7 percent rise. 
Sales at wholesalers gained 0.2 percent in October after being flat the prior month. At October's sales pace it would take 1.19 months to clear shelves, unchanged from September.

1448,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 08, 2014 04:15PM ET</span>",Stagnant Wage Growth Hampers Auto Sales Rebound,"By Angelo Young -

The U.S. auto industry is in the midst of a rebound as annual sales of new cars and trucks approach prerecession levels this month. But it’s taken six years for annual new-auto sales to recover from a 30-year low in the midst of the Great Recession, and stagnant wage growth for U.S. workers could keep the industry from reaching its prerecession heights.
Hidden in 2014’s stellar sales numbers is a rarely acknowledge fact: Automakers are increasingly offering longer-term financing deals to lure reluctant buyers. The efforts boost sales in the short term, but borrow from future sales because buyers in longer-term loans buy new cars less often. The phenomenon is likely to hamper future sales.
""If wages were growing, we'd be in a market over 17 million already,"" Steven Szakaly, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), told Automotive News. By most estimates, new-auto sales are expected to hit 16.4 million in 2014. The last time sales topped 17 million was in 2001, a year after sales hit an all-time high of 17.4 million. The NADA expects new-car sales to remain below the historic high for years to come. ""I think these wage and income challenges are with us for the next several years,” Szakaly added.
Hourly wages in the U.S. aren’t keeping pace with inflation. Wages have grown an average of 2 percent a year since the recession ended in 2009, but adjusted for inflation hourly wage growth stands at a tepid 0.5 percent since 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In past postrecession recoveries real wage growth could top 9 percent a year as the prosperity of employers and shareholders would trickle down to their workers. But not anymore.

In order to deal with less cash in the pockets of working Americans, automakers have been extending loan terms to record lengths. Chrysler Group in October began offering a staggering 84-month financing program through its Chrysler Capital affiliate for a range of new Chrysler cars, including the all-new Chryser 200 sedan. This is the first time 84-month loans have been used since before 2008 when some automakers tested long-term financing on select vehicles.
The industrywide average loan term has been marching upward as consumers sacrifice overall savings on interest in return for lower monthly payments. As of this year's third quarter, the average loan term for a new car stood at 66 months, 5 percent longer than it was in the same period of 2008 during the midst of the Great Recession."

1460,By International Business Times,"<span>Dec 08, 2014 12:15AM ET</span>",UK Consumer Spending Rises As 'Black Friday' Crosses Atlantic,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - British consumer spending grew strongly in November after many big retailers adopted U.S.-style ""Black Friday"" promotions, payments company Visa Europe said on Monday, suggesting spending for 2014 as a whole may rise at its fastest rate since 2010.
Echoing other data which have pointed to the robustness of Britain's economic recovery, Visa's UK expenditure index showed household spending rose at its fastest annual rate since August, up 2.0 percent after inflation versus 1.4 percent in October.
Spending rose by 1.6 percent month-on-month in November, picking up from October's 0.5 percent monthly growth rate.
Last week the Bank of England said consumers increased borrowing at the most rapid pace since 2006 in October, while earlier official data showed household spending in the three months to September rising at its fastest in four years.
""With Christmas just around the corner, consumer appetite remains positive, suggesting overall spending (growth) this year looks set to reach levels not seen since 2010,"" said Kevin Jenkins, a senior Visa Europe executive.
Results for the high street, where spending grew at the second-fastest annual rate since July 2010, were especially impressive, with shops benefiting from Black Friday sales which kick-started trading in the Christmas period.
This year several British retailers fully embraced the U.S.-born shopping frenzy for the first time, leading to surging crowds, fights and record sales for some, such as Britain's largest department store group John Lewis.
By contrast, online spending last month was lower than a year earlier, though the decline was less than in October.
The fastest spending growth was seen in hotels, restaurants and bars, where sales are more than 10 percent higher than a year ago, while the biggest falls came at businesses such as hairdressers and jewelers.
The Visa data is based on credit and debit card transactions that account for around a third of all spending in Britain. The figures are adjusted for inflation and to be representative for all consumer spending, not just that made by card."
1461,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2014 11:59PM ET</span>","China faces more pressure as November imports drop unexpectedly, exports slow","By Kevin Yao 
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports shrank unexpectedly in November while export growth slowed, fuelling concerns the world's second-largest economy could be facing a sharper slowdown and adding pressure on policymakers to ramp up stimulus measures. 
Exports rose 4.7 percent from a year earlier, while imports dropped 6.7 percent, the biggest drop since March, data released by the General Administration of Customs showed on Monday. 
That left the country with a record trade surplus of $54.5 billion, which analysts say could increase upward pressure on the yuan  even as exporters are struggling. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to grow 8.2 percent, a 3.9 percent rise in imports and a trade surplus of $43.5 billion, all slowing from October. 
""Despite another record surplus, the details paint a grim picture with slower export growth and a contraction in commodity imports in volume terms,"" said Andy Ji, senior currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Singapore. 
Exports have been the lone bright spot for China's economy in the last few months, perhaps helping to offset soft domestic demand, but there are doubts about the accuracy of the official numbers amid signs of a resurgence of speculative currency flows through inflated trade receipts. 
Dariusz Kowalczyk at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong said over-reporting in exports may have been curbed in November, which contributed to a weaker reading. But he added the import contraction was ""shocking"", reflecting not only lower commodity prices but poor domestic demand. 
""This means that pressure will rise on the government to do more to stimulate growth,"" he said. 
""We expect a reserve requirement ratio cut in December, introduction of reverse repos this week, and another rate cut in the first quarter. The yuan should rise further on the data."" 
After saying for months that China does not need any big economic stimulus, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) surprised financial markets by lowering rates on Nov. 21 to shore up growth and help firms pay off mountains of debt. 
The government is due to release data on factory output, fixed-asset investment and retail sales later this week. 
Analysts see more policy moves in coming months if the economy continues to stumble, with many expecting both more rate cuts and reductions in banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR). 
Sources familiar with China's policy-making said leaders are prepared to lower rates again and loosen lending curbs on concerns that falling prices could cause a spike in bad loans, business failures and job losses. 
""We expect at least one more policy rate cut, 2-3 RRR cuts and targeted measures (to inject more liquidity into the banking system) throughout 2015,"" said Haibin Zhu at J.P. Morgan. 
2015 GROWTH TARGET COULD BE CUT 
Annual economic growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest since the global financial crisis, weighed down by a sagging housing market and tighter credit conditions. 
Full-year growth is on track to undershoot the government's 7.5 percent target and mark the weakest expansion in 24 years. 
China's leaders are reluctant to repeat strong stimulus similar to the one implemented during the height of the global crisis, which resulted in piles of debt, but they are mindful of the risk that a sharper growth slowdown could undermine reforms. 
The leadership is due to open a key meeting on Tuesday to map out economic and reform plans for 2015, including economic targets which will be unveiled in parliament next March, sources at top government think-tanks said. 

Government think-tanks, which make policy proposals, have urged Beijing to cut its economic growth target next year, probably to around 7 percent.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2014 04:20PM ET</span>",U.S. factories show luster with bullish November hiring,"By Jason Lange 
(Reuters) - While the acceleration in U.S. hiring last month was surprisingly sharp and broad-based, a sector that has had a particularly rough 21st century - manufacturing - offered one of the brightest signals. 
U.S. factories added 28,000 jobs in November, the most in a year, according to government data released on Friday. Manufacturers also raised the average work week for their production workers to 42.2 hours, returning to levels reached earlier in 2014 that were the highest since the end of World War Two. 
""We are definitely in growth mode,"" said Lee Eilers, the chief executive at Marion Mixers, an Iowa maker of giant mixing machines used in the production of everything from pancake mix to dishwasher soap. 
The firm has added three welders this year, bringing its head count to 44, and Eilers plans to hire six more people in 2015, although he said there are enough available workers in Marion, Iowa, that he doesn't have to pay signing bonuses. 
After hemorrhaging hundreds of thousands of jobs during the first decade of this century, the U.S. factory sector is now an example of America's economic upswing even as a slowing global economy and a stronger dollar clouds the outlook for exporters. 
Employers added 321,000 workers to their payrolls last month, with strong gains in most sectors, from construction and retail to finance. 
In manufacturing, the rise in hours worked was particularly illustrative because it could signal further hiring ahead for a sector that has added about 700,000 jobs over the last five years but that remains 5 million jobs in the hole in the 21st century. 
""Manufacturers are getting just about all they can out of their current workforce,"" said Russell Price, an economist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. ""As long as they see new orders come in the door, they're going to have to hire more employees to satisfy those orders."" 
While part-time employment has climbed significantly since the 2007-09 recession, a brisker pace of business in November led businesses across the economy to give their workers more hours as well. Among all private sector workers, the workweek in November was its longest since May 2008. 
Still, factories are also good examples of the U.S. economy's inability in recent years to generate a faster pace of wage gains. Manufacturing wages grew a tepid 1.5 percent in the 12 months through November. 
While a top Federal Reserve official said this week that faster wage growth could be around the corner, Friday's data suggested that manufacturers and other firms still had leverage in setting wages even as they expanded their payrolls. Across the private sector as a whole, average hourly earnings were up just 2.1 percent over the past year. 
Grammer Inc., a subsidiary of Germany's Grammer AG (DE:GMMG), opened a factory in Lee County, Mississippi, in September and plans to hire 650 workers to make car consoles and seats for heavy machinery. The plant currently employs 92 workers who were selected out of a torrent of applicants from the region, which suffered throughout the 1990s and early 2000s as the furniture manufacturing industry shrank. 

When Grammer's hiring began in the spring, the agency in charge of the process had to cap the number of applications at 5,000.

The Commerce Department said on Friday new orders for manufactured goods declined 0.7 percent after a revised 0.5 percent drop in September. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new orders received by factories would be unchanged after a previously reported 0.6 percent fall in September. 
There are conflicting signals on the manufacturing sector, with the so-called hard data suggesting a cooling in activity, while sentiment surveys point to a building of momentum. 
Factory orders excluding the volatile transportation category dropped 1.4 percent in October after being flat for two straight months. 
Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.4 percent in October. Order backlogs have increased in 18 of the last 19 months. Inventories edged up 0.1 percent, while shipments fell 0.8 percent. 
That left the inventories-to-shipments ratio at 1.31, up from 1.30 in September. 
The Commerce Department also said orders for durable goods, which are manufactured products expected to last three years and more, rose 0.3 percent instead of the 0.4 percent gain reported last month. 

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - fell 1.6 percent instead of the 1.3 percent decline reported last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers added the largest number of workers in nearly three years in November and wage gains picked up, a sign of economic strength that could draw the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates.
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 321,000 last month, the most since January 2012, the Labor Department said on Friday. The unemployment rate held steady at a six-year low of 5.8 percent.
""I think it will put pressure on the Fed to raise rates in the first half of next year by June, perhaps even March,"" said Craig Dismuke, chief economist at Vining Sparks in Memphis, Tennessee.
Data for September and October were revised to show 44,000 more jobs created than previously reported, adding more sparkle to the report. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by only 230,000 last month.
U.S. stocks opened higher, while the dollar jumped against the euro to its highest level since August of 2012 as traders moved forward bets on when U.S. rates would rise. The yield on the two-year Treasury note reached its highest level since May 2011.
November marked the 10th straight month that job growth has exceeded 200,000, the longest stretch since 1994 and further confirmation the economy is weathering slowdowns in China and the euro zone, as well as a recession in Japan.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed exports increased 1.2 percent in October, helping to narrow the trade deficit. Exports to the European Union, China and Japan all increased.
The report provided the latest sign that a strengthening jobs market is starting to spur faster wage growth, a key factor that will help determine the timing of the U.S. central bank's first rate hike.
Average hourly earnings rose by 9 cents in November, the largest increase since June of last year.
""If you see a few more months of improvement of this magnitude, it is a clear sign that the labor market is tightening and is poised to break out next year,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Nevertheless, the latest gain in earnings left them up just 2.1 percent from a year ago - in the same tepid range they have been in for the past few years and well below the 3 percent or more economists say the Fed would want to see before lifting benchmark interest rates.
The Fed has held overnight borrowing costs near zero since December 2008. Ahead of the report, futures markets pointed to the first rate hike in September of next year; after the data, they indicated traders were betting rates would rise in July.
Details of the employment report were upbeat, with most of the measures Fed Chair Janet Yellen tracks to gauge the amount of slack in the labor market showing further improvement.
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell to a fresh six-year low of 11.4 percent from 11.5 percent in October.
The ranks of the long-term unemployed are also shrinking.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, was steady at 62.8 percent.
Job gains were broad-based, with employment in professional and businesses services jumping by 68,000. Retail payrolls increased by 50,200 as employers stepped up hiring in anticipation of a strong holiday shopping season.
Manufacturing and construction employment accelerated from October. Government payrolls increased by 7,000. The length of the workweek increased to an average of 34.6 hours, the highest since May 2008, from 34.5 hours in October.

U.S. employment rose by 321,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.8 percent, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected net job growth of 230,000.
The gain is over the average 228,000 jobs added monthly since January. In October, the economy added a net 243,000 jobs, more than economists had expected and an upward revision from the 214,000 initially reported.
Still, the healthy job growth in the economy won't matter to a significant portion of Americans. For most workers, real wages have fallen or remained flat since the 1970s; many Americans who work part-time jobs want to work full-time; and nearly two-thirds who are able to work have dropped out of the labor force, the highest portion opting out of work since the 1970s.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap fell 0.4 percent to $43.4 billion. September's shortfall on the trade balance was revised up to $43.6 billion from a previously reported $43.03 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade deficit falling to $41.4 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit was little changed at $50.84 billion, suggesting trade would be a drag on fourth-quarter gross domestic product.
Trade was one of the contributors to the third quarter's brisk 3.9 percent annualized growth pace.
Imports increased 0.9 percent in October to a record high of $241 billion. Petroleum imports were the lowest since November of 2009. A domestic energy boom has enabled the United States to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, easing pressure on the trade deficit.
Declining oil prices, which fell in October to their lowest level since February of 2011, are also helping to curb the import bill.
While a slowing global economy is dampening crude oil prices, there is little sign that U.S. exports are taking strain.
Exports increased 1.2 percent to $197.5 billion in October.
Exports to the European Union increased 8.5 percent, while China saw a 36 percent jump in the value of goods it imported from the United States. Exports to Japan rose 4.0 percent, while those to Canada and Mexico - the main U.S. trading partners - reached record highs.
Sustained dollar strength, however, is expected to undercut export growth in the months ahead.

Imports from China hit an all-time high, leaving the politically sensitive trade gap at $32.6 billion.

In its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide on or before Nov. 24, the U.S. central bank said a number of its districts remained optimistic about the outlook.
""Consumer spending continued to trend higher in most districts in October and November,"" the Fed said. ""Some contacts viewed lower gasoline prices as a contributing factor to higher consumer spending, and an early cold spell helped spur sales of winter apparel in several districts.""
The report, compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, is in line with manufacturing and employment data that have suggested the economy was weathering slowing global demand.
Despite a sharp drop in crude oil prices, drilling activity in shale production districts remained steady, the Beige Book showed.
""In early November, oil and gas exploration activity decreased in North Dakota and increased in Montana relative to a month earlier; production remained at record levels,"" the Fed said. ""Despite recent declines in oil prices, officials in North Dakota expect oil production to continue increasing over the next two years.""
Oil prices have declined since June and touched a five-year low early this week, reflecting in part slowing global economic growth and increased domestic production in the United States.
The Beige Book found that employment gains were widespread across the districts.
Strengthening labor market conditions resulted in employers in some districts struggling to retain key workers as well as fill job openings in sectors such as information technology, engineering, legal and health services, manufacturing and transportation.
While inflation remained subdued, a number of districts reported slight-to-moderate increases in labor costs.

""Upward wage pressures continued to be evident for certain types of occupations and for skilled workers,"" the Fed said.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2014 12:47PM ET</span>","U.S. jobs, services sector data underscore economy's resilience","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private companies added workers at a fairly brisk clip in November and the services sector grew strongly, suggesting a slowing global economy is having a limited impact on domestic activity. 
Strengthening labor market conditions, however, have yet to spur faster wage growth, other data on Wednesday showed, which could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to maintain its very low interest rate policy for a while. 
""With all of the talk about a recession in Japan, possible recession in the euro zone and in Russia, the U.S. economy is looking much more attractive,"" said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. 
Payrolls processor ADP said private-sector employment rose by 208,000 last month after increasing by 233,000 in October. Private payrolls have now increased by more than 200,000 in seven of the last eight months. 
The ADP report, which was jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was released ahead of the government's more comprehensive November employment report on Friday. 
Private sector job gains last month were broad-based, though the pace of hiring in both the services and goods-producing sectors slowed a bit. Economists said that did not change their expectations for Friday's report to show a gain of above 200,000 in nonfarm payrolls. 
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of services sector activity rose to 59.3 last month from 57.1 in October. The latest reading is just below a post-recession high hit in August. 
Any reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity. New orders and order backlogs increased, while a gauge of export orders rose solidly, defying slowing economic growth in China and the euro zone, as well as Japan's recession. 
COMPENSATION TEPID 
U.S. stocks and prices for U.S. government debt were little changed. The dollar hit a 27-month high against the euro as traders bet that the European Central Bank would decide to pump more money into the euro zone economy at a meeting on Thursday. 
Another Labor Department report showed compensation per hour increased at a tepid 1.3 percent rate in the third quarter rather than the 2.3 percent pace reported last month, and fell at a 0.9 percent rate in the second quarter instead of rising at a 2.3 percent pace as previously reported. 
The steep revisions brought compensation in line with the government's gauge of average hourly earnings and eased fears that wage growth was rising a bit faster than the Fed had expected. 
""That implies the Fed may not be facing demands to raise rates anytime soon,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Wages are one of the key factors that will determine when the Fed will start raising benchmark overnight interest rates, which it has kept near zero since December 2008. 
With compensation sluggish, unit labor costs - the price of labor for any given unit of production - fell at a 1.0 percent rate in the third quarter, a further sign of the lack of inflation and profit pressure. 
They previously had been reported to have increased at a 0.3 percent pace. Revisions to second-quarter data showed a steeper pace of decline than previously reported. 
Most economists expect the Fed to begin bumping rates up around the middle of next year.

1523,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2014 04:39PM ET</span>","Solid construction, auto sales data boost U.S. growth picture","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending recorded its largest gain in five months in October, easing concerns of a sharp slowdown in fourth-quarter economic growth.
The growth outlook also got a boost from strong automobile sales in November.
""The economy is on firmer ground than people think, it remains a beacon of light in a world where growth in many countries remains subpar,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
Construction spending rose 1.1 percent, the biggest advance since May, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
September's construction outlays were revised up to show only a 0.1 percent drop instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent fall. Economists said that suggested the gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter could be raised by 0.2 percentage point to a 4.1 percent annual rate.
The government will publish revisions to third-quarter GDP growth data later this month. Spending on residential and nonresidential structures such as factories and power stations previously was reported to have made no contribution to growth.
GROWTH ESTIMATES RAISED
""We see third-quarter GDP growth being revised up, with most of the upside in business investment in structures,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
Economists, who had expected construction spending to rise only 0.6 percent in October, also raised their fourth-quarter growth estimates, which now range between a 1.7 percent and 3.0 percent rate.
Separately, auto sales raced to an annual rate of about 17.1 million units in November, the best pace for that month since 2003 and well ahead of analysts' estimates for a rise to a rate of 16.7 million units.
General Motors Co, Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co all reported year-to-year sales gains in November, while Ford Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co Ltd had modest declines.
The upbeat construction and auto sales data indicate some momentum in the economy after weak durable goods orders data last week stoked fears of a sharp moderation in the pace of fourth-quarter growth.
In October, private construction spending increased 0.6 percent, with outlays on residential projects posting their biggest rise since December of last year.
Residential spending was boosted by increases in both single and multi-family homes as well as renovations.

Spending on public construction projects increased 2.3 percent in October as federal government outlays recorded their largest gain in eight years. State and local government investment snapped two straight months of declines.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2014 05:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone producer prices fall at sharpest rate in a year,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone factory prices fell at their sharpest monthly rate in a year in October as the cost of energy and non-durable goods such as food dropped sharply, putting pressure on the European Central Bank to do more to lift the bloc's depressed economy.
Prices at factory gates in the 18 countries sharing the single currency declined by 0.4 cent from September, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Tuesday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.3 percent drop.
The figure was pulled down most by a 0.9 percent drop in energy costs and by a 0.6 percent decline of non-durable goods prices, depressed by the slide in oil and commodity prices.
October's fall in producer prices feeds into of the euro zone's wider problem with deflationary pressures. Factory prices have only risen in June and September this year.
On an annual basis, prices fell 1.3 percent in October, in line with market expectations and a slightly lower pace than the 1.4 percent slide seen in both August and September. Only prices of capital and durable consumer goods rose.
The steepest annual declines were seen in Slovakia, Estonia and the Netherlands.
The global financial crisis and the ensuing euro zone crisis have badly hurt banks' willingness to lend, damaged business confidence and left the region fighting record unemployment, which has sapped consumers ability to spend.
Now the near 10 trillion euro ($12.4 trillion) euro zone economy is facing the threat of deflation, which would make it even more difficult for the indebted bloc to pay off its debt.
Euro zone consumer inflation cooled to a five-year low in November, suggesting deflation remains a real threat for the ECB.
Nevertheless the ECB is not expected to announce more stimulus measures at this Thursday's monetary policy meeting, with more of a wait-and-see stance, according to euro money market traders polled by Reuters.
To bring inflation back to about 2 percent, ECB chief Mario Draghi wants to restore the ECB's balance sheet to its March 2012 level of around 3 trillion euros, compared with 2 trillion euros now, which should increase demand by flooding markets with cash and support lending to smaller firms that are the backbone of the economy.

Eleven of 15 traders said the ECB would be able to meet the 3 trillion-euro goal over the next 12 to 18 months.

1532,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 01, 2014 10:39PM ET</span>",Reserve Bank of Australia holds steady at 2.5% as expected,"Investing.com - The Reserve Bank of Australia kept its cash rate steady at a record low 2.5% as expected on Tuesday, signalling a period of stability in line with previous statements. Below is the full-text statement:
Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.
Growth in the global economy is continuing at a moderate pace. China's growth has generally been in line with policymakers' objectives. While weakening property markets present a challenge in the near term, economic policies have been responding in a way that should support growth. The US economy continues to strengthen, but the euro area and Japan have both seen weakness recently. Some key commodity prices have declined significantly in recent months, reflecting somewhat softer demand and, more importantly, increased supply.
Global financial conditions remain very accommodative and long-term interest rates and risk spreads remain very low. Differences in monetary policies across the large jurisdictions are affecting markets, particularly exchange rates.
In Australia, most data are consistent with moderate growth in the economy. Resources sector investment spending is starting to decline significantly, while some other areas of private demand are seeing expansion, at varying rates. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued. Overall, the Bank still expects growth to be a little below trend for the next several quarters.
Inflation is running between 2 and 3 per cent, as expected, with recent data confirming subdued rises in labour costs. Although some forward indicators of employment have been firming this year, the unemployment rate has edged higher. The labour market has a degree of spare capacity and it will probably be some time yet before unemployment declines consistently. Hence, growth in wages is expected to remain relatively modest over the period ahead, which should keep inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate.
Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and have continued to edge lower over the past year or so as competition to lend has increased. Investors continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth is moderate overall, but with a further pick-up in recent months in lending to investors in housing assets. Dwelling prices have continued to rise.
The exchange rate has traded at lower levels recently, in large part reflecting the strengthening US dollar. But the Australian dollar remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the significant declines in key commodity prices in recent months. A lower exchange rate is likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth in the economy.
Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand and help growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.
In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity moderated in November, but sustained gains in new orders and a rebound in exports suggested the economy remained on a firmer footing despite slowing global growth.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its index of national factory activity fell to 58.7 last month as the pace of restocking slowed. The index had touched a 3-1/2-year high of 59 in October.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the nation's manufacturing sector.
""The world economy may be faltering, but that is not stopping the U.S. economy from improving,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
A separate report from financial data firm Markit showed its U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers index fell to a 10-month low of 54.8 in November from a reading of 55.9 in October. But this survey has a short history, making it a less reliable gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity.
Other reports showed manufacturing growth across Asia and Europe easing in November.
There had been concerns that weak global demand was undercutting U.S. manufacturing after data last week showed a second straight month of declines in planned business spending on equipment in October.
U.S. stocks were trading lower on concerns about the global economy. Consumer stocks also were pressured due to disappointing in-store retail sales for the Thanksgiving weekend, traditionally a major shopping period.
Prices for shorter-dated U.S. Treasury debt slipped and the dollar fell against a basket of currencies.
The ISM survey showed new orders increased to their highest level since August, while export order growth also accelerated.
Survey respondents reported ""substantial"" order intake for machinery, which they said had resulted in ""a very healthy backlog."" Furniture manufacturers said business continued to be ""stronger than last year.""
""There is no sign that the stronger dollar and/or the weakness seen globally is negatively impacting manufacturing in the U.S.,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.While a measure of factory employment ebbed a bit in November, it remained consistent with solid job growth. Electrical equipment, appliances and components manufacturers said they continued to hire people. They also noted that people were leaving to take other jobs.
Falling commodity prices, especially crude oil, saw a gauge of prices paid by factories falling to its lowest level since July 2012.

""This price dynamic is a positive for corporate profits and signals lower inflation pressures in the economy,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Markit's final November manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the bloc was 50.1, its lowest reading since June 2013 and down from a flash reading on Nov. 19 of 50.4, despite price cutting made possible by tumbling input costs.
That is barely above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and, in a sign that there is little prospect of improvement in December, new orders declined for a third month.
The growth slowdown comes despite factories cutting prices at the steepest rate since mid-2013 although neither factor will push the ECB into altering its already very loose policy when it meets on Thursday, according to a Reuters poll. [ECB/INT]
Annual inflation fell to 0.3 percent in November, firmly in the ECB's deflation ""danger zone"", and as oil sank to its lowest in over five years on Monday with the industrial bellwether copper not far behind, there are few reasons to expect any meaningful pick-up.
Both U.S. crude and Brent have now fallen for five straight months, the longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis and the rout has spread to gold and silver while the dollar rose to seven-year peaks against the yen <USD/JPY>.
Lower commodity prices are a boon to consumer spending power but have damaging side effects in a world where official interest rates are already at historic lows in many countries.
Slowing inflation acts as an unwanted tightening of policy as it pushes up real interest rates, one reason China and Japan surprised with new stimulus measures in recent weeks.
After saying for months China does not need any big economic stimulus, the central bank wrongfooted markets by lowering rates in late November.

Monday's gloomy news began in Asia with China's HSBC/Markit PMI touching a six-month trough of 50.0. The official version was scarcely better, slipping to 50.3 in November from October's 50.8.
""This is the lowest reading since March and highlights downward pressure on China's growth in the manufacturing sector,"" Credit Agricole economist, Dariusz Kowalczyk, said.
China's troubles were felt broadly across the region, with South Korea reporting exports to Asia's economic powerhouse falling for the first time in three months, while its measure of manufacturing activity stayed stuck in contractionary territory.
In Indonesia, the PMI was at its lowest since the survey began in April 2011, while in Japan, the Markit/JMMA version of the PMI eased. The economy slipped into recession in the third quarter as the impact of a hike in sales taxes lingered longer than anyone expected.
Still, the extent of the contraction may have been overstated, given figures out on Monday showed business investment was stronger than thought.
India was a rare bright spot, as it has been for a few months now, with its PMI climbing to a 21-month high last month.
British manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up a little speed as domestic demand offset falling exports from Europe and emerging markets.
A PMI covering the United States, due later on Monday, is expected to show solid but slowing growth.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2014 04:40AM ET</span>",UK manufacturing grows slightly faster in November despite lackluster exports: PMI,"LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturing activity unexpectedly picked up a little speed in November as domestic demand offset falling exports due to sluggish orders from the euro zone and emerging markets, a survey showed on Monday.
Markit/CIPS's UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 53.5 from 53.3 in October, reaching its highest level in four months and keeping well above the 50.0 mark denoting expansion.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected the index to weaken slightly to 53.0.
Growth in new orders helped push up employment in the sector to a four-month high.
The survey adds to signs that a slowdown in Britain's economic recovery at the end of 2014 is unlikely to be sharp.
That will be welcome news for finance minister George Osborne who is set to deliver a half-yearly update on the economy on Wednesday.
Osborne has warned that Britain is not immune to weakness in the global economy, and Monday's survey showed manufacturing exports continued to fall - although by less than in October - as orders from the European Union, emerging economies and Russia slowed.
Orders from the euro zone were also hit by the weakening of the euro against sterling, survey compilers Markit said.
Inflation pressures in the manufacturing sector remained subdued as input costs fell for a third consecutive month, while output prices increased at their slowest pace since June of last year, reflecting the exchange rate and low commodity prices.
""Waning inflationary pressures in industry will continue to provide some leeway for the Bank of England to hold off from raising (interest) rates even as solid growth persists,"" , Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said.
Falling oil prices could further reduce costs, he said.
Manufacturing accounts for about 10 percent of Britain's economy. A survey for the country's dominant services sector is due to be published on Wednesday.

A separate survey published on Monday by employers group CBI showed Britain's economy continued to grow in the three months to November as manufacturing helped offset a slowdown in the retail sector. While growth remained slower than earlier in the year, it was still well above the long-run average.

The final Markit/JMMA Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was 52.0 in November, less than a preliminary reading of 52.1 and lower than a final 52.4 in October.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the sixth consecutive month.
The output component of the PMI index was 52.7, less than a preliminary reading of 53.5 but still higher than 51.3 in October. New export orders, seen as key to offsetting stubbornly sluggish domestic demand, rose for the fifth month running but at a markedly slower pace than in October.
Input costs for Japanese goods producers rose at the fastest rate since January, however, as a further depreciation in the yen offset weaker global commodities prices.
The economy slipped into recession in the third quarter as a sales tax increase in April had a larger and more prolonged impact on consumer spending and business investment than expected.

Analysts believe the economy likely resumed expansion in the current quarter, but there are lingering concerns about the strength of the recovery.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2014 09:20PM ET</span>",China's official PMI slips to eight-month low in November,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed to an eight-month low in November, suggesting the world's second-largest economy is still losing momentum and more policy easing may be needed in addition to a surprise interest rate cut last month.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 50.3 last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday, still indicating a modest expansion in activity but below forecasts for 50.6 and October's 50.8.
The data came after China cut interest rate unexpectedly on Nov. 21, stepping up efforts to support an economy that is heading toward its slowest expansion in nearly a quarter of a century, saddled under a mountain of debt.
The economy grew 7.3 percent in the third quarter of this year, its slowest pace since the global financial crisis, and risks missing the government's official target for the first time in 15 years, adding to concerns that it is becoming a drag on global growth.
""The continued decline in the November PMI indicated that economic growth is still in a downward trend,"" Zhang Liqun, an economist at the Development Research Centre, said in a statement.
Monday's PMI survey, which is biased toward large, state-owned factories, showed that demand for Chinese goods was stronger in China than abroad.
The new orders sub-index, a proxy for foreign and domestic demand, stood at 50.9, down from 51.6 in October, but still above the 50-point mark that demarcates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The new export orders sub-index slipped to 48.4, down 1.5 percentage points from October and indicating orders had fallen on a monthly basis.
A preliminary PMI survey released last week by HSBC/Markit showed growth in the manufacturing sector stalled in November, with output contracting for the first time in six month, adding to signs that the economy was losing traction.
Monday's official PMI also showed factory employment shrank in November, leaving the employment sub-index at 48.2.

Beijing is aiming to grow the economy by around 7.5 percent in 2014, though a run of weak data so far this year has led many analysts to predict that growth would fall short of that target.

1564,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 30, 2014 08:15PM ET</span>",Thanksgiving Weekend Shopping Down From Last Year; Early Promotions Major Factor,"By Marcy Kreiter - Spending for the Thanksgiving weekend is off 11 percent from last year, the National Retail Federation reported Sunday. Total spending was $50.9 billion with shoppers shelling out an average $380.95 each, down from $407.02 from 2013, an NRF survey indicated.
Federation CEO Matt Shay blamed the drop on early promotions and better online offerings. Black Friday still drew the largest number of shoppers, about 86.9 million, with nearly a third saying they shopped on Thanksgiving Day as well.
“A strengthening economy that changes consumers’ reliance on deep discounts, a highly competitive environment, early promotions and the ability to shop 24/7 online all contributed to the shift witnessed this weekend,” Shay said in a press release.
Holiday shoppers spent an average $159.55 online, about 41.9 percent of their total budgets. That was down more than 10 percent from last year's average $177.67.
""Every day is going to be Black Friday, every minute is going to be Cyber Monday. You can't let up for a minute because of the competitive nature that is out there,"" Shay told the Chicago Tribune.
The hottest items were discounted high-end apparel, televisions and toys, with 54.5 percent of in-store and online shoppers going for clothing, 32.6 percent buying toys and 34.2 percent purchasing electronics. Nearly 35 percent bought books, videos or video games while 20 percent bought home décor items, 28.1 percent bought gift cards and 15 percent bought jewelry.

""Shoppers this year have made it clear that they no longer only value deep discounts on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. They want the entire package from beginning to end -- free shipping, early promotions, convenient ways to use their mobile devices and, of course, hard-to-beat online deals,” said Pam Goodfellow, principal analyst at Prosper Insights & Analytics, which conducted the survey.
Thanksgiving weekend sales were cannibalized by retailers who pushed Black Friday deals earlier in the week and online. The Wall Street Journal reported Target offered some of its deals Wednesday while Walmart started Monday.
The NRF survey of 4,631 consumers was conducted Nov. 28-29 by Prosper Insights & Analytics and had a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points."

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 30, 2014 08:00PM ET</span>",Japan's third-quarter recession seen milder than feared as capex grows ,"By Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's fall into recession between July-September could turn out to be less severe than feared, with new capital expenditure figures out on Monday suggesting revisions will put third quarter economic growth in a more positive light.
The 5.5 percent year-on-year rise in capital expenditure over the third quarter reported on Monday followed a 3.0 percent annual increase in April-June, which could ease concerns about recovery from a sales tax increase earlier this year.
""The revised data will show a smaller contraction in GDP that could be close to zero,"" said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.
""Other data on consumer spending, factory output and business investment show these three factors will drive future growth.""
Compared with the previous quarter, capital spending excluding software rose a seasonally adjusted 3.1 percent, versus a 1.5 percent decline in April-June in an encouraging sign of vigorous business investment.
Preliminary data showed the economy contracted an annualized 1.6 percent in July-September, confirming Japan had entered its third recession in the past four years as a sales tax hike in April hurt consumer spending and business investment.
In preliminary GDP data, capital expenditure shrank 0.2 percent, versus the median estimate for 0.9 percent increase.
Revised gross domestic product data is due on Dec. 8. The finance ministry data released on Monday is used to re-calculate the capital expenditure component of GDP.
The recession set the stage for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to delay a second sales tax hike that was originally scheduled for next year.
Pushing back the tax hike has eased concerns about consumer spending, but the recession has also shown that Abe's policies have not been enough to strengthen the underlying economy - even after some two years in office.

Economists expect Japan to resume growth in the current quarter as consumer spending, and Monday's strong capital expenditure, show that growth will become more broad-based.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 28, 2014 01:00AM ET</span>","Japan inflation slows in October, highlights challenge facing Abe","By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Stanley White
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual core consumer inflation slowed for a third straight month in October due to falling oil prices, highlighting the economic gloom facing Premier Shinzo Abe as he campaigns for a new mandate to implement his stalled recovery plan.
""Inflation could continue to slow because oil prices are falling,"" said Hidenobu Tokuda, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute. ""Other data show the economy is recovering, but this is not really because of Abe's policies.""
Analysts remain skeptical of the Bank of Japan's view that inflation will accelerate to 2 percent in the fiscal year from April 2015 on a stronger job market and the economy moving closer to its potential output.
One reason for this scepticism is the belief among many economists that the real reason inflation picked up earlier this year was high oil prices and a weak yen.
Oil prices have since reversed course and are now languishing at a 4 1/2-year low, and economists say this could wipe out the inflationary impact of a weak yen and slow consumer price gains even more.
Finance Minister Taro Aso shrugged off these concerns on Friday, telling reporters after the data was published that Japan is escaping deflation because of rising prices.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes oil products, rose 2.9 percent year-on-year in October. That matched economists' median estimate and was slower than a 3.0 percent annual gain in the prior month.
Excluding the effects of April's tax hike, inflation was estimated at 0.9 percent, less than halfway to meeting the BOJ's 2 percent goal, a level investors see as impossible to reach next year.Household spending fell 4.0 percent in the year to October, down for seven months in a row, slower than a 5.6 percent annual decline in the previous month.
Factory output unexpectedly rose in October, suggesting companies have reduced inventories of unsold goods built up after April's sales tax hike triggered a recession.
Abe could draw some comfort from the manufacturing and household spending data, but there are still doubts that his reflationary ""Abenomics"" policy has done enough for the economy ahead of a Dec. 14 election.
Japan's jobless rate fell to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent in September, while the jobs-to-applicants ratio rose to 1.10, matching levels not seen in 22 years.

1603,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 27, 2014 09:30PM ET</span>","Japan's Industrial Production Rises, Beating Forecasts","By Mark Hanrahan - Japan’s industrial production rose 0.2 percent from September to October, confounding predictions it would fall by -0.6 percent and marking the second consecutive month of gains, according to preliminary figures released by the country’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Friday. Although it beat forecasts, the advance is still smaller than 2.9 percent increase from August to September.



Economic news from the country was not all positive, however. Retail sales fell -1.4 percent in October, more than the -0.5 percent that economists had been predicting, the Financial Times reported.

The Shinzo Abe-led government boosted Japan’s sales tax from 5 percent to 8 percent in April, the first tax hike there in 17 years, CNBC said. The country’s economy has struggled to deal with the tax increase’s impact on demand, and many manufacturers are struggling with their inventories, limiting the scope for increased production, according to MarketWatch.

Good economic data is crucial to Abe at this time, as he seeks to build public support for his economic policies ahead of snap parliamentary elections next month.

“The economy may be starting to turn around,” Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, told the Wall Street Journal. “But the momentum is very small.”"

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 27, 2014 05:40AM ET</span>",Euro zone economic sentiment rises slightly in November,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Morale in the euro zone rose for the second straight month in November as a pick-up in industry sentiment just outweighed increased pessimism among consumers, offering a tentative sign that the bloc is avoiding outright stagnation.
The European Commission said on Thursday that economic sentiment in the 18 countries sharing the euro rose to 100.8 this month from 100.7 in October and 99.9 in September. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a decline to 100.3.
The optimism was mirrored by a rise in the business climate indicator for the euro zone, which the Commission said stood at 0.18 in November, up from a revised 0.06 in October.
Following a crisis that nearly broke up the bloc, the euro zone is suffering from very low inflation and a recovery so fragile that it is dragging on global growth, while unemployment remains near record levels.
That was clear in the Commission's data, which showed consumer confidence falling to a nine month low in November, although it typically lags in a recovery.
The Commission expects the euro zone economy, which generates almost a fifth of global output, to avoid a recession this year, but it will not reach stronger growth until 2016, a year later than the EU executive had previously predicted.
Industry showed the way in November, improving for the second month in a row. Retail trade faired well, while services were flat. Construction was down.
""The positive development in industry confidence was fueled by an important improvement of managers' assessment of overall order books,"" the Commission said in its statement.

The soft figures suggest anemic wage growth continues to weigh on spending, which economists thought would get a lift from falling gasoline prices. Income increased 0.2 percent in October after a similar gain in September. 
In another report, the department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 1.3 percent in October for a second straight month. 
The drop in so-called core capital goods orders points to an ebbing in the robust pace of spending on equipment in the second and third quarters, and suggests the economy is not fully immune to Japan's recession and cooling growth in China and Europe. 
""It reflects companies' increased uncertainty about the impact of slower global growth and stronger dollar on their demand outlook, leaving many to approach capital expenditure plans with increased caution,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Core capital goods shipments, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gauge of gross domestic product, fell 0.4 percent, reversing September's gain. 
Factory activity in the Midwest slowed in November as new orders fell sharply, another report showed. 
HOUSEHOLDS PERKY 
The data suggest growth has braked from the third quarter's brisk 3.9 percent annual rate, with fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates ranging between a 1.4 percent and 3.0 percent pace. 
While low gasoline prices have not boosted spending, they are lifting confidence. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index hit its highest level since July 2007 in November. 
U.S. stocks rose marginally, the dollar fell against a basket of currencies and prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose. 
A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose above the 300,000 threshold last week for the first time since early September. 
But the underlying trend remains consistent with a firming jobs market. 
Fresh data also showed that the housing sector continued to muddle along in October, with new home sales rising moderately and new contracts to buy previously owned homes falling. 
The moderate pace of consumer spending, combined with falling gasoline prices, is keeping inflation under wraps. 
The personal consumption expenditures price index rose 1.4 percent in the 12 months through October, Commerce Department data showed. Excluding food and energy, it increased 1.6 percent, the largest gain since December 2012, but still well below the Federal Reserve's target. 
Fed officials hope their policy of near-zero interest rates helps lift the gauge up to their 2 percent target.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 26, 2014 12:49PM ET</span>","New home sales rise in October, but September revised down","WASHINGTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes rose for a third straight month in October, but a downward revision to the prior month's sales pace indicated the housing market recovery would remain gradual. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that sales gained 0.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 458,000 units. September's sales pace was revised down to 455,000 units from 467,000 units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales rising to a 472,000-unit pace last month. 
New home sales, which account for about 8 percent of the housing market, tend to be volatile month to month. Compared to October last year, sales were up 1.8 percent. 
Housing remains constrained by slow wage growth, which is resulting in a slow pace of household formation. 
Last month, new home sales rose 7.1 percent in the Northeast and surged 15.8 percent in the Midwest. In the populous South, sales fell 1.9 percent and were down 2.7 percent in the West. 
With sales rising modestly, the stock of new houses available on the market rose 1.0 percent last month to the highest level since June 2010. 
At October's sales pace it would take 5.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 5.5 months in September. Six months' supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand. 

The median new home price jumped 15.4 percent from a year ago to a record $305,000.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final November reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 88.8, its highest reading since July 2007 on a final basis. The reading was up from the 86.9 the month before but slightly below the preliminary reading of 89.4.
Despite the uptick, it was below the median forecast of 90.0 among economists polled by Reuters.
""Consumers more frequently reported hearing about positive rather than negative economic developments in the November
survey, with reports of improving employment the dominant news item,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
""While there was no change in evaluations of the current performance of the economy or the year-ahead outlook - both remained at positive levels - the longer term economic outlook improved substantially.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 102.7 from 98.3, just below a forecast of 103.0.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations edged up to 79.9 from the 79.6 in October and was short of the expected 80.8.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation slipped to 2.8 percent, the lowest year-ahead inflation rate expected since October 2010, from the 2.9 percent in the prior month. The survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook was at 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent in October.

But overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more
increased 0.4 percent, snapping two straight months of declines.
Durable goods orders have been volatile in recent months because of big swings in aircraft orders. Orders for transportation equipment increased 3.4 percent in October after declining 3.3 percent in September.
The gain came despite Boeing BA.N receiving only 46 aircraft orders, down from 122 in September, according to information posted on the planemaker' s website.

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2014 09:40PM ET</span>",U.S. economy resilient in third quarter as global growth cools,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a much faster pace than initially thought in the third quarter, pointing to strengthening fundamentals that should help it weather slowing global demand. 
The Commerce Department on Tuesday raised its estimate of GDP growth to a 3.9 percent annual pace from the 3.5 percent rate reported last month, reflecting upward revisions to business and consumer spending, as well as to inventories. 
The rise in output followed a 4.6 percent advance in the prior three months to mark the two strongest back-to-back quarters since the second half of 2003. It underscored the economy's resilience against a backdrop of a Japanese recession, an anemic euro zone and a slowing China. 
""This report will go some way in providing further confirmation about the sustainability of the current economic recovery,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Economists had expected growth would be trimmed to a 3.3 percent pace. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at its fastest pace since the first quarter of 2012. 
But the otherwise upbeat picture was marred somewhat by other data showing consumer confidence sliding to a five-month low and a further moderation in house price gains. 
U.S. stocks were little changed while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose marginally. 
The ebb in consumer confidence in November was surprising given falling gasoline prices and a firming jobs market. 
""Economic growth is strong and getting stronger by the day. The consumer gets it, even if they aren't yet saying it,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
The third quarter was the fourth out of the past five that the economy has expanded above a 3.5 percent pace, well above the level economists consider to be trend. 
Some of the momentum appears to have carried over into the final three months of the year, with data from manufacturing to employment and retail sales suggesting continued strength. 
But with inventories rising more than previously estimated in the third quarter, economists expect the pace of restocking to slow, holding growth below a 3 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
STRONG FUNDAMENTALS 
Highlighting the economy's strong fundamentals, growth in domestic demand was raised to a 3.2 percent pace from the previously reported 2.7 percent rate. 
""This is vindication for the Federal Reserve that they downplayed concerns overseas and it's appropriate to speak about rate hikes next year,"" said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. 
The U.S. central bank has kept benchmark borrowing costs near zero since December 2008, but is expected to start raising them around the middle of next year. 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised up to a 2.2 percent pace in the third quarter from the previously reported 1.8 percent rate. 
Business spending on equipment was raised to a 10.7 percent rate from a 7.2 percent. While exports grew, the pace was less brisk than previously reported, leaving trade contributing only 0.78 percentage point to GDP growth instead of 1.32 percentage points. 
Growth in wages and salaries was revised lower for both the second and third quarters. Economists said that brought the GDP-based wages and salaries measures into line with earnings figures from the government's survey of nonfarm employers. 

""This should ease concerns that the Fed was falling behind the curve due to mismeasured wage inflation data,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2014 06:38AM ET</span>",Jump in private consumption helps Germany avoid recession in third quarter,"By Noah Barkin 
BERLIN (Reuters) - A sharp rise in private consumption more than compensated for stubborn weakness in investment to help the German economy post modest growth in the third quarter and avoid a technical recession, data showed on Tuesday. 
The Federal Statistics Office confirmed an earlier flash estimate showing a 0.1 percent rise in seasonally-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP). 
Private consumption rose 0.7 percent quarter-on-quarter, the biggest increase in three years, and public investment rose 0.6 percent. Overall consumption contributed 0.5 percentage points to growth, while trade provided modest support. 
On the downside, investment in equipment tumbled by 2.3 percent, while gross capital and construction investment also fell. Overall, investment subtracted 0.7 percentage points from GDP growth in the quarter. 
But in a positive sign for the fourth quarter, inventories were a major drag on growth, suggesting a rebound in the final months of the year. 
""We are not in a recession,"" Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told parliament after the data was released. 
""We don't have quite such good economic growth as we did before but we are performing close to our economic capacity. We can't allow thoughtless chitchat about a 'crisis' to encourage one."" 
He defended Chancellor Angela Merkel's ""grand coalition"" government against accusations that it is not investing heavily enough in infrastructure, spending that critics say is vital to help spur growth in Europe. 
After the German economy contracted by 0.1 percent in the second quarter, some economists had feared it would sink into a technical recession with another drop in the third, weighed down by weakness in key euro zone trading partners such as France, a slowdown in China and uncertainty from the Ukraine crisis. 
But Germany managed to eke out some growth and now appears to be regaining momentum. On Monday, a closely-watched measure of business sentiment from the Munich-based Ifo think tank rebounded strongly, helped by a drop in the euro to two-year lows against the dollar and by a decline in oil prices. 
Low unemployment, rising wages and rock-bottom interest rates are also providing support. 

Still, Germany no longer looks like the ""growth locomotive"" that defied the euro zone crisis to grow strongly in 2010 and 2011.

1679,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 24, 2014 06:45AM ET</span>",German Business Morale Rebounds In November,"By Reuters - German business sentiment rebounded in November, breaking a streak of six straight declines, in a sign that Europe's largest economy may be gaining some momentum again after narrowly avoiding a recession in the third quarter.
The Ifo's business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, rose to 104.7 from 103.2 in the previous month, the Munich-based think tank said on Monday. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted another decline to 103.0.
""The downturn in the German economy has ground to a halt for the moment at least,"" said Ifo President Hans-Werner Sinn.
The German economy has been hit by a slowdown in key euro zone trading partners and the West's confrontation with Moscow over Ukraine, which has unsettled businesses and led to a sharp drop in exports to Russia.
In the third quarter, the economy managed meagre growth of just 0.1 percent, narrowly dodging a recession after contracting by 0.1 percent in the second quarter.
But Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters that the decline in the euro to a two-year low against the dollar and falling oil prices were contributing to a more positive sentiment among German businesses.
""It's too early to say whether we are seeing a change in the trend. This is a positive signal, but we need to wait until December to see if it continues,"" Wohlrabe said.
Last week the ZEW think tank's measure of analyst and investor sentiment bounced back sharply, suggesting that the mood in Germany was improving.

The November Ifo index showed improvements in the manufacturing, wholesaling andretail sectors, while construction weakened marginally.
""Today’s Ifo reading gives clear comfort for our view of an accelerating economy in the final quarter of the year,"" said Carsten Brzeski of ING.
But he added that stagnating economies in France and Italy still posed risks for German growth.
""At the current juncture, it is still hard to tell whether solid domestic demand can offset weaker industrial activity; and if so, for how long,"" Brzeski said. While the strong labor market and low interest rates are supporting private consumption and the construction sector, the export-oriented industry is still going through a dry spell."""

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2014 11:20AM ET</span>",U.S. underlying inflation rising; economy firming broadly,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Underlying inflation pressures rose in October, even as falling gasoline prices kept overall U.S. consumer prices in check, bolstering expectations of a mid-2015 interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
Other data on Thursday showed vigor in the economy, with home resales rising at their fastest pace in a year in October and factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region expanding in November to its highest level since December 1993.
The Labor Department said on Thursday its so-called core Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, increased 0.2 percent, the largest increase in five months, after nudging up 0.1 percent in September.
In the 12 months through October, the core CPI rose 1.8 percent after rising 1.7 percent in September, which should ease fears about deflation.
However, falling gasoline prices, which offset rising rent, household furnishings, airline, recreation, new motor vehicles and medical costs, left the overall CPI unchanged last month after a 0.1 percent gain in September.
""One number does not change the monetary policy outlook, but the stability in core inflation may help to offset some of the Fed's concerns about declining inflation expectations,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
The Fed targets 2 percent inflation and it tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI.
Minutes of the Fed's Oct. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed most policymakers expect inflation will edge lower in the near-term and subsequently move toward its target.
But there was a bit of concern over falling market-based inflation expectations, with some officials saying they should be monitored for signs of ""a possible downward shift in longer-term inflation expectations.""
The U.S. central bank has kept its short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. Most economists expect the first interest rate increase sometime in the mid-2015.
HOME SALES RISE
In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 1.5 percent to an annual rate of 5.26 million units, the highest rate since September 2013, a sign that the housing market continued to regain strength.
Data from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showed its business activity index jumped to 40.8 this month, the highest reading in nearly 21 years, from 20.7 in October.
A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing.
""The U.S. economy appears to be doing relatively fine. It's not great but the doomsayers have very little on which to hang their hats,"" said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG in New York.
U.S. stocks trimmed losses on the data, while the dollar firmed slightly against the euro and the yen. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt pared gains.
Declining energy and commodity prices against the backdrop of a slowing global economy, and a strengthening dollar are keeping inflation below the Fed's target.
Sluggish wage growth, despite a strengthening labor market is also keeping a lid on inflation.

Another report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for unemployment benefits fell 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 291,000 last week, staying below the 300,000 threshold for a 10th straight week.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2014 10:04AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales hit one-year high in October,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales jumped to their highest level in more than a year in October and outpaced the sales level a year ago for the first time in 2014, further evidence the housing market is on a recovery path.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) on Thursday said existing home sales rose 1.5 percent to an annual rate of 5.26 million units, the highest rate since September of last year. Sales rose 2.5 percent compared to a year ago, the first time since October 2013 that nesales have risen above the prior-year levels.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales falling to a 5.16 million-unit pace, from an upwardly revised rate of 5.18 million units in September.
""This is the first time in the year where we have seen a year over year annual gain, which means that existing home sales have made that successful U-turn,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, told reporters.
Housing is slowly regaining its footing after activity stalled in the second half of 2013 following a run-up in mortgage rates. While the sector continues to be hobbled by sluggish wage growth, a recent decline in mortgage rates should help support sales.

A separate report this week from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase homes surged last week as low rates lured potential buyers.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2014 08:35AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims fall; continuing claims lowest since 2000,"WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell less than expected last week, but continued to point to strengthening labor market conditions. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 291,000 for the week ended Nov. 15, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
The prior week's data was revised to show 3,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, increased 1,750 to 287,500, still at levels consistent with solid employment growth. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims dipping to 285,000 last week. Claims have now been below the 300,000 threshold for 10 straight weeks, a sign that the labor market is tightening. 
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing last week's claims data, which covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for November's nonfarm payrolls. 
Though the four-week average of claims increased 6,250 between the October and November survey period, another month of employment gains above 200,000 is expected. 
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 73,000 to 2.33 million in the week ended Nov. 8, the lowest since December 2000. 

The unemployment rate for people receiving jobless benefits was at 1.8 percent for a 10th straight week
