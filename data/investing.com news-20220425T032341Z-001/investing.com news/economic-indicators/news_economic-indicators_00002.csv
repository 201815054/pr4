0,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 11:55PM ET</span>",Instant View: China's economy grows slower than expected in second quarter,"(Reuters) - China's economy grew more slowly than expected in the second quarter, as tepid manufacturing activity, higher raw material costs, and fresh COVID-19 cases weighed on the recovery momentum.
Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.9% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, missing expectations for a rise of 8.1% in a Reuters poll of economists.
Growth slowed significantly from a record 18.3% expansion in the January-March period, when the year-on-year growth rate was heavily skewed by the COVID-induced slump in the first quarter of 2020.

MARKET REACTION 
Asian shares advanced on Thursday as economic data from China was largely more resilient than expected, and as U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell assured that tapering of its massive stimulus was still a way off. 
COMMENTARY:
IRIS PANG, CHIEF ECONOMIST FOR GREATER CHINA, ING, HONG KONG
""Considering all of the data released, the recent developments in international politics, and ongoing domestic reforms, the RRR cut and rollover of MLF look more reasonable.
""We believe that there will be another RRR cut in the next quarter if these risk factors do not abate.
""We are revising our 2021 GDP forecast to 9.4% from 8.7%, mainly due to our weaker forecast in 2Q than the reported figure, and a slight upward adjustment for 3Q21 to reflect the boost from the RRR cut.
""We expect no change in policy interest rates for 2021, including the loan prime rate and 7D policy rate. We are keeping our USDCNY forecast at 6.45 for the end of 2021."" 
JULIAN EVANS-PRITCHARD, SENIOR CHINA ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, SINGAPORE
""Base effects continued to distort the June data so we focus on the seasonally-adjusted m/m changes. Retail sales softened to 0.7% last month from 0.8% in May, most likely due to localised curbs in response to a virus outbreak in Guangdong province. 
""But the industry improved slightly, with output growth edging up to 0.6% m/m from 0.5%, perhaps reflecting stronger exports and easing shortages of semiconductors.
""Headwinds to growth are likely to intensify during the second half of the year. China's COVID-19 export boom appears to have peaked and will unwind over the coming quarters as vaccine rollouts and reopening help to normalise global consumption patterns. The upshot is that we expect q/q growth to remain slow by historic standards over the next few quarters, with headline y/y growth likely to end the year below 5%."" 
CARLOS CASANOVA, SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR ASIA, UNION BANCAIRE PRIVEE, HONG KONG 
""The release from the NBS says that China's economy will continue to recover, but still faces external uncertainties. That is a nod to the fact that U.S. demand is going to peak, inventories are already replenished. So we really are looking at that domestic pivot away from the supply side towards the demand side, or in other words, from manufacturing to consumption to take place. That will, however, only happen very gradually because sentiment is subdued as a result of everything that's been happening on the regulatory front, but also as a result of too-aggressive policy tightening.
""I wouldn't go as far as calling it a mistake because there's a whole set of policy priorities that they are trying to balance, but they've definitely decided to take a U-turn on that and put a put it on the back burner for the time being to make sure that pickup in domestic consumption does take place in the second half. 
LI WEI, SENIOR CHINA ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED, SHANGHAI
""Solid performance in H1. Upside risk grows after the policy setting turned more supportive with RRR cut and pledges to accelerate infrastructure investment by the government.
""The slowdown angst is overdone.
""The gap between households consumption and income growth narrowed, suggesting recovery in confidence and reduced precautionary sackings."" 
XING ZHAOPENG, SENIOR CHINA STRATEGIST, ANZ, SHANGHAI 
""The data was largely driven by low base effect as the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing's Xinfadi Market took place last June.
""Based on the current situation, if policymakers do not act, the GDP figure in Q4 could fall out of the reasonable range as data from last Q4 was shining.
""Given these factors have mainly influenced the supply side, I expect the government to roll out targeted easing measures."" 
GARY NG, ECONOMIST, ASIA-PACIFIC, NATIXIS, HONG KONG
""China's 2Q GDP shows that the cyclical rebound from the pandemic has peaked. The future momentum will be more normalised and also return to more structural factors as well. 
""One of the concerns is if we look at household income growth, it's still slightly lagging behind the economic growth as well, so that may exert some pressure on consumption. And for investments, basically there is a sharper slowdown from June data mostly because of the base effect, but another point is ... there is actually lower bond issuance from the local governments as well. So that means that infrastructure spending may have decelerated as well. 
""The PBOC has partially rolled over 100 billion (yuan) ... I think it's a signal that - yes, the monetary policy tone is going to be softer, but it's not going to be massive liquidity raining into the market."" 
LOUIS KUIJS, HEAD OF ASIA ECONOMICS, OXFORD ECONOMICS, HONG KONG
""We recently cut our 2021 GDP growth forecast to 8.4% (from 8.9% previously) to reflect the recent weakness. But we expect growth to gather pace in H2. Household consumption should be supported by rising vaccination and corporate investment by the recovery in profit.""
""We expect the pick-up in H2 momentum to allow policymakers to broadly continue normalizing macro policy. Indeed, we don't think the recent RRR cut heralds a shift to monetary easing. Meanwhile, the rise in PPI inflation has likely run its course."" 
ZHU CHAOPING, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, SHANGHAI
""China's economy looks like on track for recovery, with the 6% annual growth goal in reach. However, the downside and structural risks in domestic demand are concerning. Long-term credit growth has remained weak as the government deploys policies to control leverage and calm the property bubble. The uncertainties in market regulation may also be weighing down short-term consumer and investor sentiment. Nevertheless, resilient external demand could help offset some domestic pressure and support aggregate growth. 
""The PBOC announced a 50bp RRR cut last week as a fine-tuning measure. This could help release Rmb 1 trillion funds for bank lending, and lower banks' funding cost by Rmb 13 billion per year. However, Rmb 1 trillion is still far below the Rmb 4.15 trillion of MLF maturing in 2H2021, suggesting the RRR cut was a structural measure to stimulate long-term lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises, rather than a sharp change in Chinese monetary policy. 
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reiterated that the government will not flood the economy with excessive liquidity, and the PBOC also emphasized that the RRR cut is simply part of normalizing the policy environment, reflecting policy makers' intention to manage market expectations for strong stimulus."" 
WOEI CHEN HO, ECONOMIST, UOB, SINGAPORE
""The numbers were marginally below our expectations and the market's expectations, (but) I think the momentum is fairly strong.
""For the monthly economic data for June, we see a slowdown in retail sales, industrial production and also fixed investment from May, but in terms of market expectations, all these numbers are better than expected. In particular, the retail sales growth was quite strong - that is quite encouraging.
""On comparison with last year, though, we will get slower growth. We expect second-half growth to be slowing to maybe around 6%. 
""Our greater concern is the uneven recovery that we've seen so far, and for China the recovery in domestic consumption is very important ... retail sales this month was fairly strong and that may allay some concerns."" 
BACKGROUND:
* China's economy has been recovering since the second quarter of last year, buoyed by solid overseas demand for its exports, but growth is losing steam as manufacturing activity slows on higher raw material costs and supply shortages.
* The central bank said it would cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves, even as policymakers have been scaling back pandemic-driven stimulus to contain debt and financial risks.
* China's economy has surprised many with the speed of its recovery from last year's coronavirus jolt, especially as policymakers have also had to navigate tense U.S.-China relations on trade and other fronts — GDP shrank 6.8% in Q1, 2020 for its first contraction since at least 1992 when official quarterly records started.
* Since then it managed a remarkable rebound and at a quickening pace, partly due to stringent lockdown measures to contain the novel coronavirus, which first emerged in China in late 2019.
* The recovery has been led by export strength as factories raced to fill overseas orders and consumption steadily picked up despite sporadic COVID-19 cases in some cities.
* China's government has rolled out a raft of support measures, including more fiscal spending, tax relief, and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the economy and support employment.

* With the economy back on more solid footing, the People's Bank of China is turning its focus to cooling credit growth to help contain debt and financial risks, but it is treading cautiously to avoid derailing the recovery.
* Authorities are especially concerned about financial risks involving the country's overheated property market, and have asked banks to trim their loan books this year to guard against asset bubble.

Thailand's tourism-reliant economy contracted 6.1% last year, its deepest slump in over two decades, with the tourism sector devastated by the impact of the pandemic. 
""Economic activity is not expected to return to its pre-pandemic levels until 2022, and the recovery is projected to be slow and uneven,"" the World Bank said in a report. 
After recording 40 million foreign tourists in 2019, Thailand is expected to receive just 600,000 arrivals this year, sharply down from a previous forecast of 4-5 million, it said.
Good exports and the ongoing rollout of fiscal support measures are expected to remain important drivers of overall economic activity, the World Bank said.
The recovery is expected to accelerate in 2022, with GDP growth projected at 5.1%, it said, noting risks to growth were skewed to the downside and the outlook remained uncertain.

The GDP outlook compared with growth of 1.8% this year and 3.9% in 2022 projected by Thailand's central bank which recently said growth could miss forecasts after the latest stricter coronavirus containment measures.
Given Thailand's COVID-19 relief and recovery efforts, its public debt level is expected to rise to 62% of GDP in 2022, exceeding the government's target ceiling of 60%, but risks to fiscal sustainability remained manageable, the World Bank said.

Gross domestic product expanded 7.9% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, down from 18.3% in the previous quarter and compared with a median forecast of 8% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. On a two-year average growth basis, which strips out the effect of last year’s pandemic, the economy grew 5.5% last quarter, up from 5% in the previous three months.
The recovery has shown signs of plateauing in recent months after a sharp V-shaped rebound driven by industrial output and exports. Consumers had remained cautious after incomes took a knock during the pandemic and sporadic virus outbreaks more recently restricted travel and spending. The June pickup in retail sales may fuel optimism that the rebalancing in the economy toward consumption is taking shape.
The second-quarter data suggest Beijing can comfortably meet its growth target of more than 6% for the year, and continue to drive global markets for commodities and industrial goods. But a slowing recovery is a possible sign the economy is more reliant on policy support than before the pandemic, a warning to other major economies as they ponder an exit from stimulus.
The offshore yuan extended declines, falling 0.1% to 6.4687 per dollar. 10-year government bond futures stayed lower while the stock benchmark CSI 300 Index pared some losses.
In a surprise move last week, China’s central bank said it will cut the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, freeing up about 1 trillion yuan ($155 billion) in liquidity that could be used to boost lending. The move went further than many economists had expected and suggested growing concerns about the economy’s growth outlook.
Earlier Thursday, the People’s Bank of China rolled over a portion of medium-term policy loans coming due, a move that confirms its intention to keep monetary policy largely unchanged. The 100 billion yuan of loans offered to banks is in addition to the liquidity from the reserve requirement ratio cut that comes into effect today.
Premier Li Keqiang also sounded a cautious note this week about the economy’s outlook, warning the nation needs to prepare for cyclical risks and make counter-cyclical adjustments.

But the figure was higher than a 7.8% rise forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Retail sales rose 12.1% from a year earlier in June. Analysts had expected an 11.0% increase after May's 12.4% rise.

Fixed asset investment grew 12.6% in the first six months of the year from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 12.1% rise and down from a 15.4% jump in January-May. 
China's economy has largely rebounded from the coronavirus hit last year thanks to pent-up demand and robust foreign orders for its exports, but recent data has suggested the recovery is losing some steam with increased raw material costs and supply shortages hurting factory activity.

5,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 02:51PM ET</span>",Ireland to cut deficit more gradually in capital spending drive,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland plans to reduce its budget deficit more gradually than previously forecast to increase capital spending on areas such as housing and expects it to fall to 1.5% of gross domestic product by 2025 from an estimated 5.1% this year.
Ireland's finance ministry had forecast in April that the deficit would drop to 0.2% of GDP by 2025 without further policy actions. Public Expenditure Minister Michael McGrath said the additional borrowing will ensure the government tackles a years-long imbalance between housing supply and demand ""head on"".
""This increase is justified given the critical role that capital investment has to play in delivering on our economic, social and climate priorities. From 2023 onwards, the government will be borrowing only to finance for capital expenditure,"" the government said in its summer economic statement.
The finance ministry said that on the basis of the deficit-GDP projections set out, Ireland should not be a fiscal outlier and that its deficit trajectory in the coming years should be broadly in line with other European countries.
To ensure that the public finances remain on a sustainable path, the government agreed to set an expenditure rule whereby core non-coronavirus related expenditure growth is fixed at the economy's estimated trend growth rate, taking account of inflation.
While the ministry almost doubled its GDP forecast for this year to 8.8% from 4.5% due to strong export growth, the new rule means core expenditure will grow by just over 5% on average per year over the period to 2025.
Ireland's debt is forecast to peak in 2022 at 108.6% of modified gross national income (GNI*) and fall more slowly than previously anticipated to 106.3% by 2025. 

GNI* is viewed by government as a more accurate measure of the size of the economy due to how Ireland's large hub of big multinationals can distort GDP. 
Ireland's debt agency said it had nudged up its target funding range for the year to 18-20 billion euros from an earlier target of 16-20 billion euros due to the government's new plan.

6,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 14, 2021 08:54AM ET</span>","Producer Prices in U.S. Surge in June, Exceeding Forecasts","(Bloomberg) -- Prices paid to U.S. producers rose in June by more than expected, indicating pressure is mounting on companies to pass along higher costs to consumers.
The producer price index for final demand increased 1% from the prior month and 7.3% from June of last year, according to data from the Labor Department on Wednesday. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the so-called core PPI also rose 1%, the most on record, and was up 5.6% from a year ago.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.6% month-over-month advance in the overall PPI and a 0.5% increase in the core figure. The annual increases were the largest in data back to 2010.
The PPI, which tracks changes in the cost of production, has accelerated at a faster pace than expected in recent months due to higher commodity prices and complications with global supply chains. Challenges in hiring skilled workers have also put upward pressure on wages.
The increases in production and labor costs help explain why the pace of consumer inflation has exceeded economists’ estimates in each of the last four months.
Consumer Prices
A report Tuesday showed the consumer price index surged in June by the most since 2008. The increase was primarily in categories associated with reopening, including hotel stays, car rentals and airfares.
Federal Reserve officials have said upward pressure on prices is likely to be transitory, but some investors worry the recent gains will lead to more persistent inflation.
The PPI report showed prices for goods increased 1.2% after a 1.5% advance in the prior month, while the cost of services rose 0.8%, the most since the start of the year. Almost 60% of the overall PPI advance was due to services, according to the Labor Department.
The increase in the costs of services reflected growth in margins received by wholesalers and retailers.
Producer prices excluding food, energy, and trade services -- a measure often preferred by economists because it strips out the most volatile components -- rose 0.5% from the prior month and increased 5.5% from a year earlier. The annual gain was the largest on data back to 2014.
In an earnings call Tuesday, packaged food company Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) Inc. reported a 8.6% increase in the cost of goods sold for its most recent quarter, with expectations for a rate of about 9% for fiscal year 2022.
“The bulk of this inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of edible fats and oils, proteins, packaging, and transportation,” Chief Financial Officer David Marberger said on the call.

(Reuters) - The number of applications for home mortgages increased last week driven by an increase in refinancing activity and an uptick in purchase activity as mortgage rates fell. 
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index rose 16.0% in the week ending on July 9 from a week earlier. This reflected a 20.4% increase in applications to refinance existing loans and an 8.3% rise in applications to purchase a home.
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages decreased to 3.09% last week, the lowest level since February, from 3.15% the prior week. This week's data included an adjustment for the Fourth of July holiday. 
""There may have been a delayed spillover of applications from the previous week, when rates also decreased but there was not much of response in terms of refinance applications,"" Joel Kan, MBA's associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting, said in a statement. ""Purchase applications increased last week, but average loan sizes decreased to their lowest level since January 2021.""
This week's data comes just one week after the number of applications for home mortgages decreased to the lowest level since January 2020.

Rising home prices combined with insufficient supply has continued to weigh on the housing market.
""We continue to see ebbs and flows as housing demand remains strong but for-sale inventory remains low,"" Kan said. ""However, lower rates may be helping some home buyers close on their purchases, especially first-time home buyers.""

""We must do everything possible so we don't get another lockdown,"" Stefan Genth, managing director of the German association of retailers (HDE) told a news briefing.
Asked for his reaction to the decision by the German state of Saxony to lift the obligation to wear masks in stores, Genth said: ""We warn against giving up such things too early.""
Germany reported 1,548 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, 563 more than a week ago, to bring the total to 3.74 million. The death toll rose by 28 to 91,287.
Chancellor Angela Merkel warned on Tuesday that more people needed to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before restrictions could be lifted, following news that England will scrap nearly all curbs from next week.
German retailers expect to record a 1.5% rise in sales in 2021, assuming no further lockdowns, the HDE forecast on Wednesday, driven by a 3.1% increase in food sales, while the rest of the sector is set to record a 4.2% decline.
Fashion stores have been particularly hard hit, with sales still expected to be down 37% in 2021 compared to 2019 before the pandemic hit.
""Spending is bouncing back but shopper traffic in the inner cities is not back to pre-crisis levels,"" Genth said.
Online sales are expected to rise by around 20% this year to just over 87 billion euros ($103 billion), the HDE said, up from a previous forecast for 17% growth.
HDE said three quarters of retail companies in Germany reported lower revenue in the first half of the year due to lockdowns.

""The crisis is not over yet, the situation is still very difficult for many retailers,"" Genth said.

LONDON (Reuters) - European corporate earnings are expected to have more than doubled in the second quarter of 2021, but many investors fear volatility could follow as the idea sinks in that Europe Inc has probably reached peak momentum.
Euro zone business growth accelerated in June at its fastest pace in 15 years and all indicators point towards a robust rebound from last year's COVID-19 induced lockdowns.
Just a week ago, the European Commission revised its forecast for euro area economic growth to 4.8% this year, much faster than the 4.3% it envisaged in May.
Profits of the 600 biggest listed European companies are seen surging 110% year-on-year for the April to June quarter, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data.
Expectations for the second quarter have been regularly revised upwards since late-April when the rise was expected at just below 90%. 
Graphic: Earnings revisions: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaxabmpa/Pasted%20image%201626250227882.png 
Growth rates are more modest for the rest of the year with 33.6% and 28.3% of earnings growth seen for the last two quarters of 2021. 
Graphic: earnings: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jznpnyaqbvl/Pasted%20image%201626250481323.png
""I think there is a high likelihood that 2Q21 earnings growth marks the peak of the current recovery cycle,"" said Christian Stocker, an equity strategist at UniCredit Bank.
Stocker still expects profits to rise about 10% next year but noted that similar periods of deceleration in past cycles have tended to increase stock market volatility, meaning there could be ""an increasing risk of some setback during the summer"".
To weather such summer squalls, investors should consider investing in defensive stocks such as healthcare and consumer staples, he added.
Bourses in Europe, just like on Wall Street, are hovering near record highs but a renewed upsurge in COVID-19 infections could easily knock them off down again. 
At about 460 points, the STOXX 600 index is already 10 points above the consensus target that a Reuters poll of funds managers and analysts had pointed to in May. 
But having risen more than 15% since the beginning of 2021, the pan-European benchmark seems to have shifted into a lower gear. 
""The dynamic through stock markets is now more prudent as 'peak growth' has already been priced in and investors are therefore less bullish than they were"", said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
""In some way, good results this quarter would validate the performance of markets but would not necessarily lift them much beyond that"", he added.
Cau predicts ""cyclical stocks to have a less bullish second half of the year"".

A survey of fund managers in July conducted by BofA showed 82% of respondents looking at single-digit percentage year-end upside for European equities. 
FOMO - the fear of missing out - remained high though, as ""47% of respondents saw reducing equity exposure too early as the biggest risk for their portfolio"".

The ministry said it expects inflation to reach 3% or more in the second half of 2021 due to a base effect from a temporary VAT cut last year that was part of the government's stimulus program to help the economy recover from the coronavirus shock.
Inflation will ease significantly in 2022, it added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's economy contracted in the second quarter after battling new outbreaks of COVID-19 but economists expect it to get back on track quickly as global growth picks up and vaccination rates rise. 
The city state's economy still showed the best growth in more than a decade on a year-on-year basis, as many economies have done because of last year's coronavirus-induced slump. 
""The economy stumbled in Q2 after the government reimposed restrictions in response to a spike in virus cases, but with new infections down and the government rolling back containment measures, the recovery should regain momentum over the coming months,"" said Alex Holmes, economist at Capital Economics.
He still expects GDP growth to come in at the top end of the government's 4%-6% estimate in 2021.
The economy contracted a seasonally adjusted 2% in the second quarter of 2021, a reversal from 3.1% growth in the preceding quarter, preliminary government data showed on Wednesday.
On an annual basis, GDP grew 14.3% in the second quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry data showed, against economists' forecast in a Reuters poll of 14.2%. 
GDP had fallen a record 13.3% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2020. The country was under a lockdown for most of that period to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Singapore had implemented tougher rules on public gatherings in May this year after a spike in COVID-19 cases. It has been loosening them over the last few weeks as vaccinations pick up. 
In absolute terms, gross domestic product in the second quarter of 2021 remained 0.9% below its pre-pandemic level in the second quarter of 2019. 
The manufacturing sector grew 18.5% on year, helped by robust global demand for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment. The construction sector expanded 98.8% compared with a year earlier when most construction activities stopped due to the lockdown. 
The Singapore dollar has lost about 2.5% this year, most of it in the past month as the U.S. dollar has climbed broadly and as a resurgence of the virus has weighed on Asian currencies. It was little changed after Wednesday's data. 
The government expects GDP to expand 4% to 6% this year, although growth could exceed the upper end of that forecast. The bellwether economy had posted its worst recession last year.
Selena Ling at OCBC Bank said the quarter-on-quarter contraction was a temporary setback. She expects the economy to return to pre-COVID-19 levels by this year-end or early 2022. 
Vaccinations have been gaining pace globally, and Singapore has inoculated nearly 70% of its population with at least one dose of a vaccine.
But many of its neighbours, including Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, are struggling with new outbreaks, which could have some spillover economic effects for the city-state, including challenging its attempts to open up its borders.

The central bank maintained its accommodative monetary policy at its last meeting in April. The next policy review is due in mid-October.
""There will probably be a pivot away from being very outrightly dovish,"" OCBC's Ling said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The White House expects supply chain pressures that are fueling higher inflation to abate in the ""not-too-distant future,"" but cannot say exactly when, a senior official said on Tuesday after June consumer prices showed the biggest gain in 13 years.
The official declined to repeat earlier forecasts that inflation would peak in the summer months, citing continued uncertainty about when supply chain pressures would ease and concerns over the emergence of new COVID-19 variants.
Asked if the bump in prices for certain services reflected any price gouging, the official said, ""that probably remains to be seen,"" adding that it was an issue worth investigating.
The U.S. consumer price index increased 0.9% in June amid supply constraints and a continued rebound in the cost of travel-related services from pandemic-depressed levels as the economic recovery gathered momentum.
The CPI jumped 0.6% in May.
White House officials remain convinced that the bump in prices is transitory, citing moderating pressures in the semiconductor market and a drop in lumber prices - two factors that have led to bottlenecks and pushed prices higher.
They cited recent upward revisions in overall growth forecasts and said President Joe Biden's COVID-19 rescue plan has been effective in driving a stronger-than-expected recovery, but also signaled growing concern about the new COVID-19 variants and lingering disparities in vaccination rates.
""We expect that these things will work themselves out in the not-too-distant future, but I can't say exactly when,"" said one official. ""We also can't say whether or not we really truly do have this pandemic under control.""
Pressed to put a timeframe on when the inflationary pressures would ease, the official said, ""We are just watching the data closely, week by week, month by month.""
Kevin Brady, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, said Biden's policies were driving up prices.
""With consumer prices at a 13-year high, Bidenflation is growing faster than paychecks, wiping out workers’ wage gains, and leaving American families behind,"" he said in a statement.
Meanwhile, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a Democratic-aligned economist who has criticized the current White House policies for potentially stoking inflation, met with top Biden economic advisers Brian Deese and Cecilia Rouse on Tuesday. His criticism has rankled White House officials, who have insisted the current spike in prices is temporary.
Though Summers was critical of Biden's initial stimulus plans, he has been supportive of spending on ""green"" infrastructure.
""They talked about the infrastructure package and the importance of passing the president’s full Build Back Better agenda,"" said a White House official. 
Summers declined to comment.
UNDERLYING PROBLEMS
Treasury bond yields rose on Tuesday, indicating that investors may start demanding increased compensation for the risk of higher prices.
About 60% of the June price increase was due to used and new cars and auto parts, the administration official said. Excluding autos and pandemic-related services, prices increased just 0.2%.
The administration is looking carefully at the sectors driving the higher prices, the official said, adding that some of the increase reflected the low level of prices seen during the pandemic.
A second official said there was continued concern about the automotive market, but the Biden administration is in close touch with dealers, producers, semiconductor suppliers and others, and remained convinced current pressures would diminish.
The White House did not expect the sharp increases in used car prices to last beyond this year, said one of the officials.

The official said some underlying problems in the U.S. economy - including a severe shortage of housing and the high price of pharmaceuticals - would remain a problem.
Biden's proposed budget included $213 billion in funding for affordable housing to address part of the issue, while the executive order he signed on Friday should result in lower pharmaceutical and hearing aid prices, the official said.

The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday rose 1.5%, recouping a little of June's 5.2% drop.
That left the index up 23.8% on July last year when the country was still emerging from a round of nationwide lockdowns. The index reading of 108.8 showed optimists outnumbered pessimists.
""Confidence has held up overall despite a sharp fall in NSW as other states - notably Victoria and Western Australia - recorded strong bounce-backs from COVID-related disruptions in June,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans.

""The main takeaway is that concerns around the current virus outbreak and associated restrictions in NSW are not spilling over to the rest of the country.""
The survey was conducted over the week of July 5-9, when Sydney was also locked down but restrictions were tightened further on July 9.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence rose in July to hit a more than two-and-a-half-year high, as the country's export-driven recovery remained intact thanks to solid global demand, the Reuters Tankan poll showed.
But in a worrying sign, service-sector sentiment turned pessimistic, as firms struggled with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis, according to the poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
""The global economy is showing signs of recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,"" a manager at a machinery maker wrote in the poll.
""But the outlook remains uncertain, as our customers are putting off business spending decisions because their budgets are on a declining trend.""
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 25 from 22 in June, its highest since November 2018, the poll conducted June 30-July 9 showed. The service index fell to minus 3 from a flat reading the prior month. (For a detailed table of the results, click)
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.
Manufacturers' sentiment got a boost from strong confidence at car, chemical and metal products makers, which offset negative conditions in the textiles and paper sector.
The poll, which surveyed 503 large- and mid-sized companies of which 257 firms responded on condition of anonymity, comes ahead of the BOJ's July 15-16 policy meeting.
The BOJ's own ""tankan"" business survey out this month also showed business confidence improved to a two-and-half-year high, while service-sector sentiment turned positive for the first time in five quarters.
The BOJ is expected to slash this fiscal year's economic growth forecasts in fresh quarterly projections as a fresh state of emergency for Tokyo, which will run through to Aug. 22, threatens to hurt consumer and business sentiment.
The Reuters Tankan poll underscored the pain firms, especially those in the service sector, were feeling from the health crisis.
""Overall consumer behaviour is slow, as sentiment isn't improving due to anti-coronavirus measures,"" a manager at a food producer wrote in the survey.

But even as they are taking a hit from prolonged curbs, the Japanese government estimated this month that it expected the economy to return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of this year, largely thanks to solid exports and a boost to consumer spending from progress in vaccinations.
Manufacturers' business confidence was seen improving further to 28 in October, while that of service-sector firms was expected to rise to 8, a slightly lower forecast for three months out than that of the previous month, the survey showed.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deflation will likely become a larger force in financial markets in the year ahead despite the recent spike in consumer prices to 13-year highs, star stockpicker Cathie Wood of Ark Invest said in a webinar on Tuesday. 
U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in 13 years in June due in part to supply constraints, the Labor Department said on Tuesday.
Wood, whose Ark Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund tracked by Morningstar last year, said technological innovation would continue to push down prices significantly.
""The message we continue to pound the table on is that nominal GDP growth, because of these deflationary forces, will be surprisingly low,"" said Wood.
As a result, 10-year Treasury yields will likely stay below 3% for the foreseeable future, pushing up the broad valuation of the U.S. stock market, she said. 
""I believe the bond market is in a bubble,"" Wood said, adding that ""too many people are afraid of inflation"" which is a ""killer"" for stock market valuations. 
Any further rallies in oil prices will likely lead to a sharper sell-off in the future as demand withers and more consumers opt for electric vehicles, Wood said. 
""We would not be on the long side of oil,"" Wood said. 
ARK remains bullish on the online betting market and estimates that the U.S. market will grow from $9.5 billion to $37 billion by 2025. The fund has a position in DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc, which is up 7.2% for the year to date. 

Wood's $23.6 billion ARK Innovation ETF suffered steep declines earlier this year as investors rotated away from growth and technology stocks to more cyclical sectors such as financials and energy. But it has gained 7.4% over the last month as Treasury yields edge lower. 
The fund is up 0.2% for the year, a performance that puts it in the bottom 98th percentile of the 595 U.S. mid-cap growth funds, according to Morningstar data.

Receipts for June jumped 87% to $449 billion, in part a reflection of this year's Internal Revenue Service income tax filing deadline being brought forward to May 17 compared to last year's pandemic-induced delay to July 15.
The Treasury also said taxes withheld from wages increased by 33%, on an adjusted basis, to $240 billion during June compared to a year ago, while June corporate taxes rose to $79 billion from $11 billion last year.
Outlays for June dropped 44% from a year earlier to $623 billion, largely due to the outsized impact on the deficit a year earlier from the implementation of the Paycheck Protection Program, a subsidy to keep businesses afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This reduction in costs helped lower the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $2.238 trillion from $2.744 trillion for the first nine months of the prior fiscal year, Treasury officials said.
Year-to-date receipts rose 35% from a year earlier to $3.056 trillion, while outlays grew 6% to $5.294 trillion.

The sector grew 23.0 percent from May 2020, statistics agency IBGE said. Economists had forecast a median rise of 22.6 percent in a Reuters poll.
Services activity rose 1.2 percent from April after seasonal adjustments.
Still, the sector remains below the levels seen in February of this year, just before a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic led to new economic restrictions in March. 
""In April and May, those measures began to relax and the sector grew again,"" said Rodrigo Lobo, who leads the IBGE survey. ""The sector is growing as a result of more vaccination, especially those (companies) that depend on in-person consumption."" 
Growth, however, did not reach all corners of the services sector in May. The IBGE survey tracks five service activities and registered growth in three of them: transportation, tourism and family services. 

Growth was highest in the tourism sector, up 18% in May compared with April. But tourism also remains 53% below pre-pandemic levels, according to the survey. 
Negative rates were registered in IT services and communications.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is on course to run a budget surplus this year, analysts say, a turnaround after strong half-year data, with high oil prices giving room to cover spending promises from President Vladimir Putin ahead of parliamentary elections.
Last month, Putin promised to spend on infrastructure, education and health, seeking to give the ruling United Russia party a boost. The pledges added to social support measures announced in April that will cost the budget around 400 billion roubles ($5.40 billion) over two years.
Russia had a budget surplus of 626 billion roubles from January to June, the finance ministry said on Monday, with tax increases, the economic recovery and high prices for oil, Russia's major export, all behind the boost in revenues.
""Such positive data is largely due to the Russian economy's earlier than expected recovery and also high prices for oil,"" said Bank St Petersburg analysts. 
Unless significant anti-COVID-19 curbs are implemented, something Putin and other senior officials have repeatedly said they want to avoid, the budget will end the year in surplus, they added. 
The finance ministry's 2021 plan was for a budget deficit of almost 2.8 trillion roubles, around 2.4% of gross domestic product this year. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov last month said the deficit would likely stand at 1% of GDP.
Increased tax revenue has also helped. Russia is planning to hit metals firms with $2.3 billion in export taxes between August and December, one of a handful of tax increases since the coronavirus pandemic pushed Russia's economy to a 3% decline last year.
""Clearly the tax burden has increased and will increase further,"" said Sofya Donets, Russia and CIS economist at Renaissance Capital. 
Renaissance Capital sees a budget surplus of 3% of GDP if oil prices remain near current levels of $75 a barrel. UralSib analysts forecast a surplus of 1.37 trillion roubles, or around 1.1% of GDP. 

""Additional spending promised by... Putin... will increase budget spending in the second half of 2021. But we think that there will be a budget surplus at the end of the year if oil prices remain high,"" Sberbank CIB said in a note.

COMMENTS:
JAMIE COX, MANAGING PARTNER, HARRIS FINANCIAL GROUP, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA 
“The headline CPI numbers have shock value, for sure; however, once you realize that a third of the increase is used car prices, the transitory picture becomes more clear.  Inflation is rising, but things are well behaved and have not changed materially.”
KEN POLCARI, MANAGING PARTNER, KACE CAPITAL ADVISORS, BOCA RATON, FLORIDA
“It came in very hot, much hotter, so it is going to be difficult for the Fed or any of the talking heads to try to talk it away as transitory. It raises the conversation, it is significantly stronger and that plays right into the ongoing inflationary concerns. Tomorrow you are going to get PPI and that is also expected to be stronger, and that is at the producer level which only means a couple of months later after you see it at the producer level it comes down to the consumer level on top of what we already have. 
That is going to cause some consternation, between that and what we are seeing already in some of the earnings reports – JP Morgan and Goldman – certainly blowing the roof off the house but you don’t see this big explosion to the upside. You see it is more moderated and the market might get a little bit weaker today.”
GENNADIY GOLDBERG, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“There are a lot of reopening-driven factors at play. Right off the bat I can see very strong rebound in used car prices, another strong rebound in airfares and lodging as well, all of these are COVID impacted.”
“A lot of this will play into the Fed’s transitory story. There is certainly some concern that some of these price increases are coming in much quicker than expected, but you can argue that a lot of this is due to the recovery.”
“The approach that they took at the last meeting was one of risk management, it wasn’t putting FAIT (flexible average inflation targeting) on the backburner, it was basically saying inflation is coming in a little bit stronger than expected therefore we are going to shift our stance modestly. We still believe in FAIT, we’re still going to let inflation run a little hot, but a lot of this is transitory and a lot of this is reopening related. I don’t think there is anything here to really change that stance.”
EDWARD MOYA, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST FOR THE AMERICAS, OANDA, NEW YORK
“That came in pretty hot and we saw short end rates jump pretty solidly here and the move was very positive for the dollar. This is really going to excite the hawks on the Fed and intensify the debate to taper sooner, and if these inflation pressures are still elevated by the time we’re at the end of the year, you’re going to see the market start to move forward interest rate hike expectations.”
NANCY DAVIS, FOUNDER, QUADRATIC CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT (email)
“Tuesday's elevated Consumer Price Index is more evidence that prices for goods are rising across the board, something that consumers have been noticing for months at the grocery store and at the gasoline pump.
“The Consumer Price Index may not be the best inflation measure, as one-third of the index's calculation is defined by shelter, which is primarily housing rent in cities. We have seen a significant divergence in real estate markets across the country - housing prices are falling in many cities due to increased demand for housing in suburbs, a trend caused by the pandemic.
“We expect the Federal Reserve to allow inflation to overshoot its inflation target in order to attain full employment. The market is currently pricing in close to four 25 bps interest rate hikes by the end of 2023, which is aggressive in our view.
“I believe investors have only just started to think about inflation. The 10-year Treasury yield is significantly below the rate of inflation and a continuation of that dynamic would likely create challenges for fixed income investors.”
JIM VOGEL, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, FHN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE
""So we've got a flatter curve, we've got a lot of increase in the three-year (U.S. Treasury note) as you should anticipate, the five-year is under some pressure, the 30-year is not. And so right now, I would call this a tame reaction as people try to dig into all of these numbers because they don't want to get wrong footed in the way they did after the May CPI.""
MICHAEL BROWN, SENIOR ANALYST, CAXTON, LONDON    
    ""(This was) clearly an upside surprise. It will make (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome) Powell's testimony on Capitol Hill tomorrow a much trickier exercise than it would've otherwise been given that it will put some additional pressure on the 'transitory' narrative.""
    ""FX reaction as one would expect given an upside surprise, with the dollar rallying across the board in line with the sharp rise in Treasury yields. All relatively contained however, within recent ranges, and one print won't significantly change the FOMC's outlook/stance. Attention now shifts to Powell's comments tomorrow, and where we are in the tapering discussion.""
KATHY LIEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, BK ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK
“It was a very, very strong number – strongest in 13 years. Clearly it was very positive for the U.S. dollar. It kind of reinforced the Fed taper story and the dollar has been consolidating for the front of the week and I think this was the kick that it needed to renew its gains.”

PAUL HICKEY, BESPOKE INVESTMENT GROUP, NEW YORK (email)
""Futures were mixed ahead of the June CPI report, but a much higher than expected print has been met initially with selling in equity futures and rising bond yields.  So far, the declines haven't been too large, but as traders digest the internals of the report, we'll be watching to see how things play out.  One driver of the gains this month was used car prices which rose 10.5% m/m and accounted for one-third of the total increase.  New car prices also increased by 2.0% m/m which was the largest m/m increase since 1981!""

22,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 07:37AM ET</span>",Analysis-The quiet revolution in Italian bond markets,"By Dhara Ranasinghe and Stefano Rebaudo
LONDON (Reuters) - A calming down of Italian government bonds, typically among the most volatile in the euro zone, suggests a sea change in the way foreign investors perceive the 2.3-trillion-euro ($2.7 trillion)market -- the bloc's biggest.
Volatility, the propensity of an asset to display wild and unpredictable price swings, is generally a negative for bond returns over time. So the message from one volatility indicator on BTPs, as Italian government bonds are known, will be welcomed by investors.
That indicator is an index of 30-day option-implied volatility on BTPs, which has fallen to around 50 basis points, around half its level a year ago and approaching levels seen for higher-rated French and German government bonds. 
The BTP volatility index, based on a working paper from the European Stability Mechanism, is also the lowest since more than three years ago, when options on BTP futures first started trading. 
Graphic: Italian bond market volatility slides: https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROZONE-BONDS/xlbpgqwbypq/chart.png 
""What we're seeing in Italian bonds is a little bit of a replay of the convergence trade that we've seen in the past, when euro zone bond markets started to trade on this idea that over time every member state could issue (debt) at the same level,"" said David Arnaud, a senior fund manager at Canada Life Asset Management.
He was referring to the period before the 2011-2012 crisis when weaker states such as Italy and Greece enjoyed borrowing costs only marginally above those of financially robust Germany or the Netherlands.
The yield gap ballooned during the crisis and then during periodic market selloffs, including last year, but has since snapped in. The steep volatility decline has followed and this time some believe it may last longer than before.
ECB, EU, DRAGHI 
Several factors are driving the change in investor perceptions towards Italy. First is the European Central Bank's bond-buying programme which has pinned down borrowing costs across the euro area. 
Second is the European Union's 800-billion-euro post-pandemic recovery fund, of which Italy is a major beneficiary, standing to receive some 200 billion euros in grants and loans in the coming years. Since then, Italy's anti-euro parties, including the far-right League, have become much less vocal in their opposition to the EU.
Finally, the appointment in February of former ECB chief Mario Draghi as prime minister raised hopes that Italy could more effectively use recovery fund monies to boost economic growth. 
All this has squeezed Italian yields lower, even as the COVID-19 crisis is projected to send Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio -- Europe's second-highest -- towards 180%. 
""We think that the market has underestimated the impact of the recovery plan, particularly in Italy, and Draghi has under-promised and will over-deliver,"" said Jacob Nell,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s head of European economics.
Last week the Italian government agreed amendments to a law overhauling the criminal justice system, a key reform plank included in the Recovery and Resilience Plan.
LOCK-STEP
It's not just volatility gauges showing Italian bonds converging with higher-rated peers. Italian and German yields have moved in lock-step over recent months, suggesting investors view Italy as less risky than before, at least for now. 
That's despite Italy's Baa3 credit rating from Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and BBB- rating with Fitch -- nine notches below Germany's triple-A score.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) analysts estimate that 75-day correlations between Italian and German bonds have risen to 0.8 from around 0.4 just before Draghi's appointment. Back in 2018, just after an election in Italy that boosted anti-euro parties, the correlation was -0.4, they said. 
Correlations between Spanish and German debt are broadly steady this year.
""The increase in the correlation between BTP and Bund yields indicates that the market is dealing with Italian debt as an asset driven more by the general macro fundamentals than by country-specific factors,"" Luca Cazzulani, UniCredit's co-head of strategy research, said.
He forecast the correlation at current high levels for a ""prolonged period.""
Investors still demand a 100 basis-point premium over German bonds to hold Italian 10-year debt, reflecting risks of premature ECB policy tightening or changes in the political scenario in Rome. 
""These two factors (a Draghi-led government and a dovish ECB stance) need to stay in play. If there was a hawkish turn by the European Central Bank, it would be challenging for Italian debt,"" Cazzulani added.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2021 06:50AM ET</span>","China's export growth quickens as global vaccinations, easing lockdowns lift demand","By Stella Qiu and Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's exports grew much faster than expected in June, as solid global demand led by easing lockdown measures and vaccination drives worldwide eclipsed virus outbreaks and port delays.
But overall trade growth in the world's second-biggest economy may slow in the second half of 2021, a customs official warned on Tuesday, partly reflecting the COVID-19 pandemic uncertainties as the Delta virus variant wreaks havoc in some countries.
Overall imports also beat expectations, though the pace of gains eased from May, with the values boosted by high raw material prices, customs data showed.
Thanks to Beijing's efforts in largely containing the pandemic earlier than its trading partners, the world's biggest exporter has managed a solid economic revival from the coronavirus-induced slump in the first few months of 2020. 
Exports in dollar terms rose 32.2% in June from a year earlier, compared with 27.9% growth in May. The analysts polled by Reuters had forecasted a 23.1% increase.
""Exports surprised on the upside in June, shrugging off the impact of the temporary Shenzhen port closure and other supply chain bottlenecks,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
""The headline US$ numbers suggest that in real, sequential terms shipments held up in June, after having moderated earlier on from the record levels of end-2020.""
China's trade performance has seen some pressure in recent months, mainly due to a global semiconductor shortage, logistics bottlenecks, and higher raw material and freight costs. 
All the same, the global easings in COVID-19 lockdown measures and vaccination drives appeared to underpin a strong uptick in worldwide demand for Chinese goods.
Germany, for example, which was at first sluggish in its vaccination drive, said this month it had caught up with the United States in terms of the proportion of the population having had one shot of COVID-19 vaccine. Close to half of Americans are now fully vaccinated, while elsewhere in Europe the rate has also increased recently.
China's strong shipment numbers last month underlined some solid factory surveys overseas. A measure of U.S. factory activity climbed to a record high in June, while Euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years.
The data also showed imports increased 36.7% year-on-year last month, beating a 30.0% forecast but slowing from a 51.1% gain in May, which was the highest growth rate in a decade.
China's crude oil imports in the first half fell 3% in their first contraction for the period since 2013, as an import quota shortage and rising global prices curbed buying, but imports of soybeans, natural gas and iron ore rose.
Asian stock markets, partly buffeted over recent weeks by concerns over the spreading Delta virus variant and easing growth rates in China, extended their gains after the trade data and were headed for the best session in more than two weeks. 
China's yuan also rose to a near one-week high against the dollar as the data tempered worries over softening GDP growth. On Friday, the People's Bank of China said it would cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves to support the economy, especially as smaller firms were unable to pass on rising raw material costs.
PANDEMIC UNCERTAINTIES
China's customs administration spokesperson Li Kuiwen said imported inflation risks were manageable, but cautioned that the country's overall trade still faces uncertainties due to the global pandemic. 
Li, speaking at a news conference in Beijing earlier in the day, said trade growth may slow in the second half of 2021, mainly reflecting the statistical impact of the high growth rate. 
""But overall we think China's foreign trade in the second half still has hopes of achieving relatively fast growth,"" he said.
China posted a trade surplus of $51.53 billion for last month, compared with the poll's forecast for a $44.2 billion surplus and the $45.54 billion surplus in May. 
Asia's economic powerhouse has contained a sporadic coronavirus outbreak in one of its major export hubs in southern Guangdong province last month. However, exporters are grappling with higher raw material and freight costs and logistics bottlenecks.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
""The pandemic-induced surge in retail sales in advanced economies has started to reverse recently as consumption patterns begin to normalise amid reopening,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
""Once retailers in these countries have rebuilt their inventories, softer consumer demand will feed through into weaker foreign demand for Chinese exports."" 

China's trade surplus with the United States swelled to $32.58 billion in June, Reuters calculations based on customs data showed, up from the May figure of $31.78 billion.
Top officials from China and the United States started exchanges in June to address mutual concerns, while the Biden administration is conducting a review of trade policy between the world's two biggest economies, ahead of the expiry of their Phase 1 deal at the end of 2021.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's crude steel output is forecast to jump 30.1% in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, as demand is picking up from a pandemic-induced slump in the previous year, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said on Tuesday.
It would mark a second consecutive quarterly increase. 
The ministry estimated crude steel output in the world's No.3 steel producer to be 24.69 million tonnes for the July to September period, up from 18.98 million tonnes a year earlier, boosted by robust demand from industries such as automobile and machinery.
It expects to log a 1.2% increase from the previous quarter, thanks also to expanding public works as part of the government's resilience plan to prevent and mitigate disaster impact, said Daisuke Matsuno, director of METI's metal industries division.
""Manufacturing industry as a whole is on track for a recovery, except for ship-building,"" Matsuno told a news conference.
The predicted steel output for this quarter will beat pre-pandemic production of 24.55 million tonnes in the same quarter in 2019, but it is not clear whether the nation's annual output would reach pre-pandemic level, Matsuno said.
""We will need to watch closely how the recent resurgence in the COVID-19 pandemic would impact steel demand at home and abroad,"" he said. 

Demand for steel products, including those for exports, is forecast to increase 17.0% to 21.75 million tonnes in July-September versus a year earlier, the ministry said, citing an industry survey.
Exports are forecast to rise 26.7% to 7.35 million tonnes, the ministry said.

Since the health crisis began, annualized growth in output per hour has risen 3.1%, a big jump from the 1.4% growth recorded in the previous business cycle, the analysts said.
""Stronger productivity growth has been one of the silver linings of the pandemic,"" economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note dated Monday.
""Higher-frequency measures indicate further gains in the middle of the year."" 
The gains are more evident in the information technology sector, followed by professional services, product development and retail sector, the note said.

Industries which have been able to carry on with virtual meetings and reduce expenditure on in-person facilities like travel and entertainment have seen improvements despite the partial re-openings, the analysts said.
Rapid vaccinations have opened parts of the economy this year, but economist Hatzius believes the reopening of offices and the face-to-face economy should not be linked to a pause or reversal of the trend as gains from workplace digitization are sustainable.

Investing.com – Chinese exports recorded a much better-than-expected growth in June, with imports and the trade balance also beating expectations. However, signs are beginning to emerge of a slowdown in China’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
Customs Administration data released earlier in the day said exports grew 32.2% year-on-year in June, higher than the 23.1% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 27.9% growth recorded in May. Imports grew 36.7% year-on year, higher than the forecast 30% growth but below May’s 51.1% growth.
The trade balance stood at $51.53 billion, the highest since January 2021. The surplus was above both the $44.2 billion in Investing.com forecasts and May’s $45.54 billion figure.
The continuous global appetite for Chinese goods such as medical goods and work-from-home equipment helped drive the surprising growth alongside rising prices. But high shipping costs and increasing production capacity outside the country have contributed to supply shortages, a possible sign of the slowdown in the COVID-19 recovery.
“The surprise surge in exports is probably in large part due to rising commodity prices, as commodities like iron ore soared and price pressures passed on from imports to exports,” Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY) senior emerging markets economist Zhou Hao told Bloomberg. However, export growth will likely slow in the second half of 2021 because of a high base in 2020, he added.
Customs administration spokesman Li Kuiwen also warned that growth in imports and exports would slow down for the rest of 2021, while noting that “China’s foreign trade in the second half still has hopes of achieving relatively fast growth.”
An outbreak of COVID-19 cases in June 2021 at one of China's major export hubs in southern Guangdong province caused delays in shipments at some major ports for much of the month. Although the outbreak was contained, exporters must now deal with rising raw material and freight costs as well as logistics bottlenecks.
China’s trade surplus with the U.S. continued to increase, reaching $32.6 billion in June. The two countries started exchanges of top officials in June 2021 to address mutual concerns, with the U.S. conducting a review of trade policy, ahead of the expiry of their Phase One trade deal at the end of the year."

Exports rose 19.9% from a year ago, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official data, up from 18.1% in May. That was higher than the median estimate of 15.1% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Growth in imports in yuan slowed to 26.1% in June from 39.5% in the previous month.
The customs administration published data for the first half of the year showing exports in yuan terms climbed 28.1% from a year earlier, while imports rose 25.9%. China will publish monthly data for June and also the value of trade in dollars later Tuesday.
Global appetite for Chinese goods including medical goods and work-from-home equipment helped to spur exports this year. But there are emerging signs the momentum could begin to moderate as the world economy and production capacity elsewhere recovers.

National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s index of business conditions dropped 12 points to +24 in June, after climbing 5 points in a very strong May survey. 
The survey's measure of confidence slipped 9 points to +11, though that was still above the long-term average.
""The decline in conditions was broad-based across states but led by a significant decline in Victoria coming off the back of the lockdown that started in late May but was eased, in a series of steps, over June,"" said NAB chief economist Alan Oster.
However, as the lockdown in Victoria eased, another began in Greater Sydney which looks set to extend for several weeks.
""The hope is that, as like previous episodes of shutdowns, that businesses bounce back on reopening,"" added Oster. ""While, there is less fiscal support around, businesses conditions have been strong and hopefully the recovery continues.""
The survey measure for trading, or sales, fell 10 points to a still-high +35 in June, while profitability lost 13 points to +25 and employment 8 points to +17.
Capacity utilisation dipped back to 83.9%, while forward orders shed 9 points to +15.

Confidence fell in all industries except mining and manufacturing, with recreation & personal suffering a steep 27 point decline as businesses were shut.
The NAB survey was conducted from June 18-30, catching the start of the Sydney lockdown.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers reported a record annual increase in sales in the three months to the end of June, although growth was flattered by widespread store closures a year earlier due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The British Retail Consortium - members of which tend to be large high-street chains and supermarkets - said on Tuesday that sales in the second quarter of 2021 were 28.4% higher than a year earlier and 10.4% higher than two years before.
The year-on-year increase was the largest since the BRC's records began in 1995.
""The gradual unlocking of the UK economy encouraged a release of pent-up demand,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
While supermarkets have been trading throughout the pandemic, 'non-essential' retailers such as clothing stores were closed for most of this year, before reopening in England on April 12. Dates varied in other parts of the United Kingdom.
Total sales in June alone were up 13.1% on two years earlier, compared with growth of 10.0% in May. Versus last year, sales were 10.4% higher on a total basis and 6.7% higher on a like-for-like basis which adjusts for changes in floorspace.
""Fashion and footwear did well while the sun was out in the first half of June, while the start of Euro 2020 provided a boost for TVs, snack food and beer,"" Dickinson said.
England's men's soccer team enjoyed a successful run in the Euro 2020 international tournament before losing in the final against Italy on Sunday.
Data released on Monday for early July showed underwhelming numbers of shoppers during the tournament's final week. 
Payments processor Barclaycard said its measure of consumer spending was also up strongly in June and stood 11.1% higher than in June 2019. In May, the same measure - which is based on almost half of British credit and debit card payments - showed spending was up 7.6%.

Spending at pubs and bars soared by 38% compared with two years ago, the biggest rise since September, and food and drink specialist stores such as off-licences saw sales jump by 76%.
""June saw Brits flock back to pubs, bars and beer gardens to watch the football and tennis on the big screens, as the heatwave early in the month encouraged many of us to get out in the sunshine and socialise,"" Barclaycard's head of consumer products, Raheel Ahmed, said.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's mining-driven economy is set for a ""vigorous"" rebound this year that should limit the need for the incoming government set to take office on July 28 to open the fiscal spending taps, current Economy Minister Waldo Mendoza said on Monday.
Peru's economy will expand by at least 10% this year and 5% the next due to fiscal injections already made, while benefiting from high global prices of commodities including copper, the country's most important export, Mendoza said. 
The Andean country, the world's no. 2 copper producer behind Chile, is waiting for socialist Pedro Castillo to be formally confirmed the next president after he narrowly edged out a conservative rival in a June 6 election. He has pledged to hike taxes on mining and increase spending on healthcare and education.
""We can grow 10%, 11% and maybe 12% this year without any additional fiscal boost thanks to the recovery of companies that have been supported by large programs of credit, funded with a state guarantee,"" Mendoza said at a press conference.
In comments aimed at the likely new leftist government Mendoza said tax hikes should be made cautiously to avoid impacting the competitiveness of the economy and said his team intended to share proposals with the incoming administration.
Castillo, a teacher and son of peasant farmers, has rattled the Andean country's political and business elite with proposals to shake up mining laws and the constitution, though he has of late looked to win over investors with more market-friendly rhetoric.
""The temptation to spend more, get into debt, is a temptation that we should not fall into,"" said Mendoza. ""Macroeconomic stability is necessary, let's not underestimate it.""

Mendoza said that the current government will leave ""very solid"" public accounts, with international reserves at 36.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) and public debt at 34% of GDP, strong levels compared to neighboring countries in the region.
""The external context is terrific,"" he said. ""It is an additional boost for the recovery, which is coming along well and is very vigorous.""

""Next week we will discuss new forward guidance that includes the new definition of price stability,"" ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Monday at an event organised by London-based think-tank OMFIF.
""The formulation of the forward guidance has to be modified to include the new definition of price stability.""
A long-awaited ECB strategy review last week saw the bank tweak its inflation target to a flat 2% in the medium term from ""below but close to 2%"" previously.
The ECB's current guidance says it will pump in stimulus via bond buys for as long as necessary and keep interest rates at their current record-low, sub-zero levels until it has seen the inflation outlook ""robustly converge"" to its goal.
De Guindos said that while the 19-country euro zone economy was currently in recovery mode, the situation remained ""fragile"" due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, adding that some members, like Spain, were not doing as well as Germany.

""We will need to maintain favourable financing conditions,"" the former Spanish economy minister said. ""The withdrawal of the fiscal and monetary stimuli has to be very prudent, very gradual and should not be premature.""

33,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>",Japan's May machinery orders rise for third straight month,"By Daniel Leussink and Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rose for the third straight month in May, a welcome sign for an economy struggling to overcome the hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
The government imposed a new state of emergency in Tokyo that will run through to Aug. 22 in an attempt to control the health crisis, clouding the outlook for the economy even as activity in many other countries rebounds.
The jump in core orders indicates a modest revival in corporate spending, seen by policymakers as necessary to accelerate Japan's tepid recovery.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, jumped 7.8% in May from the previous month, beating a 2.6% expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll and compared with a rise of 0.6% in April.
""The data confirmed a recovery in capital spending by manufacturers,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""But while non-manufacturers saw quite a big rebound in orders, their starting point was different. They haven't seen a recovery in conditions yet.""
By sector, orders from manufacturers grew 2.8%, boosted by electrical machinery, helped by demand for such investments due to a global semiconductor supply shortage. 
Those from non-manufacturers rose 10.0%, rebounding from the prior month's sharp decline, led by other non-manufacturers and telecommunications, which saw orders rise for the first time in six months, the Cabinet Office data showed on Monday.
Separate Bank of Japan data on Monday showed Japanese wholesale prices rose 5.0% in the year to June, a sign global inflationary pressures are weighing on firms that are still facing coronavirus emergency curbs at home.
In declaring the state of emergency, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said last week it was key to prevent Tokyo, which is hosting the Olympic Games, from becoming a flashpoint of new infections.
But with the move, Suga risks hurting Japan's economic recovery. Dai-ichi Life Research Institute estimated that the state of emergency could slash about 1 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) from gross domestic product and cut 55,000 jobs over the coming months.
Lawmakers from the prime minister's Liberal Democratic Party have escalated calls for a new relief package, with party heavyweight Toshihiro Nikai saying an extra budget of around 30 trillion yen ($270 billion) is needed.
On Sunday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan stands ready to pump more money into the economy, providing support for businesses and people in need.
The government raised its assessment on machinery orders for the first time since December, saying they were showing signs of pickup.

From a year earlier, core machinery orders, which exclude those for ships and electricity, rose 12.2% in May, beating a 6.3% advance expected by economists.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wholesale prices continued to surge in June as import costs spiked at the fastest pace on record, data showed on Monday, a sign rising raw material costs were weighing on corporate profits.
Households may also start to feel the pinch as recent increases in oil costs are likely to push up consumer inflation in coming months, though the rebound will be more modest in Japan than in other advanced nations due to weak demand, analysts say.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, rose 5.0% in June from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed, beating a median market forecast for a 4.7% gain.
It followed a 5.1% increase in May, which was the fastest pace of growth since September 2008, and marked the fourth straight month of year-on-year gain.
""Wholesale prices will remain under upward pressure as steady COVID-19 vaccinations continue to support the global economic recovery,"" said Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division.
""More and more companies are being able to pass on higher costs,"" mainly in sectors like steel and energy, he said.
Of the 744 items consisting CGPI, the number of items that saw prices rise in June exceeded that for price falls by 75 - up from 57 in May.
In a sign a weak yen was inflating raw material costs for firms, the yen-based import price index surged 28.0% in June to mark the fastest year-on-year gain on record.
An index gauging raw material prices jumped 49.8% in June from a year earlier, as commodities ranging from fuel oil to wood see prices spike on solid global demand.

On the other hand, domestic final goods prices - which loosely track the consumer price index - rose just 2.0% in a sign weak domestic demand was still discouraging many firms from passing on the higher costs to their corporate customers.
Japan's economy is recovering moderately as robust exports offset some of the weakness in consumption. But a resurgent coronavirus forced Japan to declare a state of emergency in the capital Tokyo that will last through the Olympics Games, casting doubts over the strength of the recovery.

LONDON (Reuters) - Big businesses in Britain are rushing ahead with post-lockdown investment plans that could usher in a long-awaited improvement in the country's weak productivity growth, a survey of chief finance officers showed.
Accountancy firm Deloitte said its poll found CFOs were planning to increase investment, as well as hiring, at the fastest pace in almost seven years and were their most aggressive about acquisitions in 11 years.
Many firms around the world have ramped up their spending on digital technology in response to the coronavirus pandemic which up-ended their working practices.
Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said CFOs were much less concerned about Brexit. COVID-19 was still the top of the worry list, followed by inflation and climate change. Over three quarters of CFOs reported growing recruitment problems.
""The pandemic, like all major shocks, will reshape the economy and we are likely to see years of normal growth compressed into just a few months,"" he said.
Eight in 10 CFOs who took part in the survey said they thought productivity would grow faster after the pandemic. 
""That offers the hope of a more comprehensive recovery than after the global financial crisis,"" Stewart said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Friday he expected that an increase in productivity gains brought about by more investment in technology since the onset of the coronavirus crisis would prove to be lasting.
Slow productivity growth weighs on an economy's long-term growth potential and ultimately the earnings of workers, and has plagued Britain's economy since the late 2000s.
Deloitte said 71% of CFOs it polled expected to increase capital expenditure - helped by British finance minister Rishi Sunak's two-year tax break for corporate investment - and 76% expected more hiring over the year ahead. By contrast, 2020's top priority had been cost reduction. 

The Deloitte survey was conducted between June 16 and 29 and polled 107 CFOs from companies, 69 of them UK-listed with a combined market value of 548 billion pounds ($758 billion).

VENICE (Reuters) - COVID-19 is probably only a forerunner of increasingly dangerous pandemics in the future and governments need to find $75 billion over the next 5 years to prepare for them, a panel of experts told finance ministers of the Group of 20 rich countries on Friday.
In a report to the G20 meeting in Venice the panel said the $15 bln per year of investments it recommended doubled current spending levels but was ""negligible"" compared with the costs of another major outbreak of a new contagious illness.
""The economic case for these additional investments is overwhelming,"" said former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who co-chaired the 23-member panel along with World Trade Organization Chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and Singapore's former finance minister, Tharman Shanmugaratnam.
Summers told Reuters in an interview he was ""guardedly optimistic"" its recommendations would be implemented and said ""we won't be reluctant to speak out"" if they are not.
""Spending tens of billions of dollars could save tens of trillions,"" he said.
To plug ""major gaps"" in pandemic preparedness, the panel identified four main areas for action: infectious disease surveillance, resilience of national health systems, supply and delivery of vaccines and other medicines, and global governance.
The report, titled ""Global deal for a pandemic age"", called for the creation of a $10 bln annual Global Health Threats Fund, plus $5 bln to strengthen the World Health Organization and create dedicated pandemic facilities at the World Bank and multilateral development banks.
In addition, low and middle-income income countries would need to add about 1% of gross domestic product to public spending on health over the next five years, it said. 
""Achieving safety from pandemics will require a basic shift in thinking about international cooperation,"" said Shanmugaratnam. ""It is the ultimate case for both national self-interest and international solidarity at the same time.""
The panel was set up in January and includes prominent names such as former European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet, Ana Botin, executive chairman of the Santander (MC:SAN) group, and Guntram Wolff, head of the Bruegel think-tank.

The G20, chaired this year by Italy, will consider its recommendations in the lead up to a joint finance and health ministers' meeting in October. 
Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters the finance ministers had been ""generally very positive"" about the report and she was confident it would be taken forward.

37,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>",UK exports to EU recover from initial post-Brexit slump,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -British goods exports to the European Union rose to their highest since October 2019 in May, official data showed on Friday, reversing a slump at the start of 2021 when Britain exited the bloc's single market and customs union.
Britain's government is likely to view the data as backing its expectation that the change in customs arrangements would only cause temporary inconvenience to most businesses.
However, overall trade with the EU has lagged behind growth in sales to the rest of the world, and business groups said they still faced extra red tape dealing with European customers and suppliers as a result of Brexit.
""While we are seeing a modest pick-up in demand for UK goods in the last month as economies reopen, the overall climate remains fragile,"" the head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, William Bain, said after the data.
Britain's Office for National Statistics said goods exports to the European Union, excluding precious metals, rose to 14.0 billion pounds ($19.4 billion) in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, their highest since October 2019 and almost twice January's level.
Total goods exports of 27.9 billion pounds, excluding precious metals, were the highest since January 2020, just before the coronavirus pandemic began to cause disruption.
Imports from the EU have also risen after a slump at the start of the year, when COVID-19 disrupted traffic across the English Channel, although they remain slightly below imports from the rest of the world. Before 2021, Britain almost always sourced most of its imports from the EU.
The head of Britain's biggest port - Dover (NYSE:DOV) - told Reuters trade disruption could return if British holidaymakers head for European summer breaks, adding to strain on stretched customs staff.
LONG-TERM EFFECT HARD TO MEASURE
Britain formally left the EU at the end of January 2020, and remained in the EU's single market and customs union for a further 11 months while it negotiated a trade agreement.
Teasing out the longer-term impact of Brexit is made harder by the slump in exports caused by COVID-19 last year, and brinkmanship in Britain's parliament in 2018 and 2019 that led to periodic fears of potential sudden border checks.
The Bank of England said last year it expected a long-term reduction in trade with the EU. Some smaller businesses - especially those selling fresh produce such as seafood - face big regulatory hurdles.
Comparing the first five months of 2021 with the same period of 2020 - which includes the severe initial impact of COVID - trade with countries outside the EU grew faster.
British exports outside the EU increased by 8%, while those to the EU rose by 5%. Imports from the EU were broadly flat while imports from further afield rose by 19%.
""The longer-term picture ... shows the severe headwinds of the pandemic, rising raw material and shipping costs, and ongoing Brexit red tape are having on the ability of UK businesses to trade with EU customers,"" Bain said.

The British figures on exports to the EU contrast sharply with recent data from Eurostat. This showed a 27% fall in EU imports from Britain for the first four months of 2021, due largely to a change in methodology on Jan. 1 to no longer count goods shipped from Britain which originated further afield.
The ONS said its figures were more consistent when comparing exports over time. ($1 = 0.7227 pounds)

Chinese banks extended 2.12 trillion yuan ($327 billion) in new yuan loans in June, up from 1.5 trillion yuan the previous month, data from the People's Bank of China showed on Friday. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans would rise to 1.8 trillion yuan in June. 
The Chinese economy has largely rebounded to its pre-pandemic growth levels, driven by the surprisingly resilient export sector. However, smaller firms are bearing the brunt of the recent surge in raw material prices, as they struggle to pass on increased costs to consumers.
To help small firms coping with rising costs, the PBOC on Friday also announced a new cut in the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, the first such move since April last year when the economy was still badly affected by the coronavirus crisis.
Loans to households rose to 868.5 billion yuan in June from 623.2 billion yuan in May, while corporate loans surged to 1.46 trillion yuan from 805.7 billion yuan in May. 
In June, total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to 3.67 trillion yuan from 1.92 trillion yuan in May and substantially higher than analysts' forecasts of 2.87 trillion yuan. 
TSF includes off-balance-sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.
The outstanding TSF rose 11% to 301.56 trillion yuan ($46.49 trillion) at the end of June from a year earlier. 
Broad M2 money supply grew 8.6% from a year earlier, also above estimates of 8.2% forecast in the Reuters poll. M2 grew 8.3% in May from a year ago.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Capital expenditure growth in Japan sped up in May, a Reuters poll of 18 economists showed, a glimmer of hope that solid exports may help boost private-sector investment for a post-pandemic growth.
Cabinet Office data due at 8:50 a.m. Monday (2350 GMT Sunday) will likely show core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 2.6% in May.
It would mark a third straight month of increase, accelerating from the previous month's 0.6% gain.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those of ships and electricity utilities, likely grew 6.3% in May, following a 6.5% growth in the previous month.
""Restrictions on people's movement have eased in those countries that have proceeded with vaccinations, raising the prospects for economic recovery,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""That has helped boost shipments of capital goods and information-related items"" underpinning Japanese exports and business investment, he added.
Separate data by the Bank of Japan, due at 8:50 a.m. Monday (2350 GMT Sunday) will probably show Japan's wholesale prices rose 4.7% year-on-year in June, slowing from the prior month's fastest annual pace in 13 years.
That would ease some concerns about higher commodity costs squeezing profits at firms struggling to pass on rising costs to customers.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for their goods, rose 0.6% month-on-month in June, slowing from the prior month's 0.7% increase.
With global inflationary pressures are pinching firms already hit by the coronavirus pandemic, the uptick in wholesale inflation is unlikely to prod the BOJ into withdrawing its massive stimulus any time soon.

As years of heavy money printing failed to fire up inflation to its 2% target, the BOJ is widely expected to maintain its powerful monetary easing for the foreseeable future.
The poll showed the BOJ will likely keep a -0.1% target for short-term rates and cap 10-year bond yields around 0% under its yield curve control at its July 15-16 policy-setting meeting.

Although the statistical base effects of sharp declines from a year ago are seen keeping headline trade numbers attractive, real demand has also made a significant recovery in recent months.
Exports are expected to have risen 23.1% in June from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 15 economists, compared with a 27.9% gain in May.
Imports likely rose 30.0% last month year-on-year, the poll showed, compared to 51.1% growth in May.

A measure of U.S. factory activity climbed to a record high in June, while Euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years.
However, exporters are grappling with higher raw material and freight costs and logistics bottlenecks.
There are signs that production bottlenecks are beginning to ease in Asia, said Frederic Neumann, an economist with HSBC, in a note. But ""that won't provide imminent relief: manufacturing elsewhere still appears tight, and there are still transportation ripples that need to be dealt with,"" he said.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Rising costs to ship crops globally are adding to concerns about food inflation that are already at decade-highs and hitting cost-sensitive consumers in import-dependent markets.
The cost of bulk carriers that move grains and oilseeds from production hubs in the Americas and Black Sea to key consumers have roughly doubled from last year due to rising fuel costs, tighter vessel supply and longer port turnaround times amid COVID-19 curbs, according to grain and shipping sources. 
""Freight cost has become a real challenge as it comes when we see huge increases in grain prices,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) in Melbourne.
""For years, buyers enjoyed low grain and freight prices. I see no immediate end to high freight costs.""

The cost of moving grains from Australia to Southeast Asia has risen to $30 a tonne from $15 last year, and to $55 from $25 from the U.S. Pacific Northwest to Asia, shipping sources said.
Ships carrying wheat from the Black Sea to Asia now cost around $65 a tonne, from around $35 last year.
""It is the cost of bunker fuel and the cost of bulk ships lifting the prices of carrying grains,"" said one trader at a leading brokerage in Singapore. ""We also have COVID-19 quarantine requirements slowing cargo movement.""
FUEL TO THE FIRE
With world food prices having risen at their fastest pace in over a decade in May, the spike in crop freight costs poses a fresh challenge to food importers and policymakers attempting to keep inflation levels in check just as several key economies reopen following coronavirus lockdowns.

Investing.com – China’s factory gate prices rose at a slower pace and consumer inflation also eased after the government stepped up efforts to rein in rising commodity prices.
China’s producer price index (PPI) rose 8.8% year-on-year in June, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Forecasts prepared by Investing.com expected an 8.8% growth in June, while a 9% increase was recorded in May.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.1% year-on-year and decreased 0.4% month-on-month in June, compared with a 1.3% rise and 0.1% decrease during the previous year and month respectively.
The world’s second-biggest economy continued its economic recovery from COVID-19 but this was clouded by persistently high inflationary pressures in the industrial sector. Chinese regulators are increasingly worried that small firms will not be able to pass on the higher costs to consumers.
However, price increase slowed in the oil and natural gas extraction, as well as the ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting and processing sectors, said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS in a statement accompanying the data release.
“The domestic policy of ensuring supply and stabilizing prices in the commodity sector is showing initial effect, driving an improvement in the market supply and demand, and a slowdown in price gains of industrial products,” Dong added.
Commodity prices of coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged in recent months as many countries eased COVID-19 curbs. To help address the issue, China’s State Council hinted on Wednesday that the People's Bank of China could cut its reserve requirement ratio for banks to give the economy a boost. It would be the first such move since April 2020, when China’s economy was badly hurt by COVID-19.
Previously, China, the world’s biggest consumer of both coal and iron ore, sold supplies from state reserves which triggered a drop in steel and copper prices.
“China’s inflation pressures are mainly on the PPI side, which is actually peaking out and will come down in the second half modestly,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) chief China economist Zhu Haibin told Bloomberg."
45,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2021 12:00AM ET</span>","China's factory gate inflation slows, outlook dimmed by still-elevated prices","By Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate inflation eased in June after a government crackdown on runaway commodity prices, but the annual rate stayed uncomfortably high and underlined growing strains on the economy as Beijing tries to bolster a post-coronavirus revival.
The persistently high inflationary pressures in the industrial sector prompted China's cabinet this week to flag potential policy easing measures, mainly to support smaller firms.
Friday's data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed the producer price index (PPI) increased 8.8% from a year earlier, compared with a 9.0% rise in May, and in line with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll.
The NBS also released consumer price inflation data, which showed a slowing last month and limited pass-through from high factory gate prices.
The PPI, a benchmark gauge of a country's industrial profitability, inched up 0.3% on a monthly basis, easing sharply from a 1.6% uptick in May, as prices for copper and steel fell. 
The monthly slowdown comes as China, the world's biggest consumer of both coal and iron ore, has stepped up efforts to rein in runaway metals prices. The measures included selling supplies from state reserves and launching investigation of illegal stockpiling and price gouging..
""The domestic policy of ensuring supply and stabilising prices in the commodity sector is showing initial effect, driving an improvement in the market supply and demand, and a slowdown in price gains of industrial products,"" said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician at the NBS in a statement accompanying the data release 
Yet, some analysts believe the government crackdown will have only a limited impact due to an ongoing imbalance between tight supplies and rising demand by more countries recovering from the pandemic.
""PPI continued to hover at an elevated level in June and we did not see a significant fallback,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank, adding that he expects PPI to trend above 7% year-on-year in the second half of the year. 
""Despite the recent changes in commodity prices, we cannot rule out price gains would accelerate again in H2. We need to stay alert to the possibility of another peak in factory-gate inflation.""
Hao Zhou, senior EM economist Asia at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), expects PPI would stay around 8-9% in the second half of the year, given the recent strength in international crude oil prices. 
POLICY SUPPORT?
Chinese leaders have raised increasing alarm over the negative impact of rising raw material prices on many small firms, which are unable to pass on the higher costs to consumers.
That in turn has stoked broader worries of a stalling in the post-COVID recovery of the world's second-biggest economy.
To help firms cope with rising commodity prices, the country's cabinet on Wednesday raised the prospect of timely cuts to the amount of cash banks must hold as reserve, which would be the first such move since April last year when the economy was badly jolted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Price gains slowed in annual terms in the oil and natural gas extraction, and ferrous and non-ferrous metal smelting and processing sectors, statistics agency's Dong said. 
Many analysts expect the pent-up COVID demand has peaked and China's growth rates are starting to moderate in the second half of the year, weighed by weakening exports, surging producer price inflation and Beijing's continued crackdown on property market. 
NBS data also showed China's consumer price index (CPI) rose1.1% in June in annual terms, slower than a 1.3% gain tipped by the Reuters poll, pointing to limited pass-through to consumers from the high industrial prices.
Pork prices, a key component of China's CPI, have been on the decline in recent months, driving a drop of 1.7% in food prices. Concerned about tumbling pork prices, authorities late last month also announced plans to buy pork for state reserves.
China's annual average consumer inflation is likely to be below 2% this year, the central bank governor Yi Gang said last month, well below the government target of around 3%.
Core inflation, which strips of volatile food and energy prices, stood at a mild rate 0.9% in June, unchanged from May, a potential source of concern for policymakers as it suggests underlying demand remains weak. 

""In our view, the elevated PPI inflation reading is the result of supply side constraints, so we expect Beijing to turn to easing measures – rather than tightening – to contain the surge in raw materials prices and support growth,"" said analysts at Nomura.
""The low CPI inflation reading, though largely driven by slumping pork prices, also provides space for Beijing to ease.""

46,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 10:09PM ET</span>",China’s Factory Inflation Eased in June as Commodities Steadied,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory inflation eased in June from an almost 13-year high in the previous month as a stronger dollar and government measures helped to cool commodity prices.
The producer price index rose 8.8% from a year earlier after jumping 9% in May, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. That was the same as the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Consumer prices increased 1.1% from a year ago, lower than in May and below the estimate of 1.2%.
Global commodity prices were mostly flat in June after rallying for more than a year, with the Federal Reserve’s hawkish shift pushing the greenback higher and weighing on commodities, which are mostly priced in dollars. Chinese regulators also took a number of steps to tame prices, from requesting commodity firms cut their bullish futures bets to pledging more releases of metal reserves.
The data was in line with the decline of both input and output prices in the official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index in June. A higher base a year earlier, when the economy was starting to recover from the pandemic, also likely helped to moderate inflation.
So far, price pressures have been mostly felt by upstream sectors, with producers unable to pass on the price increases to consumers due to intense competition and a slow recovery in domestic consumer demand. People’s Bank of China’s Governor Yi Gang said last month that consumer inflation will stay under 2% this year, below the government’s official target of about 3%.
In a surprise move, the government hinted this week that it will cut the reserve requirement ratio, or the amount of money banks must keep in reserve, in order to help firms deal with the impact of rising commodity prices. This could better support small businesses and lower their financing costs, the State Council said in a statement Wednesday.

The analysis looks at spread of the virus' Delta variant versus the pace of vaccination, which in some countries is not accelerating enough to offset higher rates of transmission.
Even if the Delta variant is shown to result in lower hospitalization and death rates, the report said, pressure on healthcare systems and a higher absolute number of deaths could occur, likely raising pressure on some governments to extend or re-impose mobility restrictions.
A separate note from Oxford Economics showed strong economic activity rebounds in Latin America on the back of gains in mobility.
(Graphic: Journey to the new normal, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzzandvw/2021-07-08_12h39_39.png) 
The JPMorgan analysis said vaccination thresholds for getting mobility back to normal vary by country, so the results are best taken as relative performance from country to country.
""The model estimates suggest that the Philippines, Peru, South Africa, Thailand, and Colombia face the longest journeys back to pre-pandemic levels of mobility, while Singapore, Turkey, India and Brazil have the shortest journeys.""

In Latin America, authorities have been less likely to re-impose or lengthen mobility restrictions, the report said.
""While the region has shown surprising resilience in the face of the virus and other headwinds, downside risks to growth could still manifest through the impact of worsening public health on confidence even if the uptrend in mobility remains in place.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The economy of Latin America and the Caribbean should grow 5.2% in 2021, although uncertainty remained about countries' uneven progress in dealing with structural problems and COVID-19 vaccination plans, the United Nations' ECLAC said on Thursday.
After the 6.8% contraction in 2020, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean upgraded its view for this year versus the 3.7% rise it projected in December.
""The dynamics and persistence of growth in 2021 and going forward are subject to uncertainties arising from uneven progress in vaccinations and the capacity that countries have to reverse structural problems,"" ECLAC said in a report.
This year's forecasts reflect the low base of comparison set in 2020, when economic activity was beset by the pandemic.
""The structural problems that limited the growth of the region before the pandemic were exacerbated and will negatively impact the recovery of economic activity and labor markets beyond the 2021 growth rebound and 2022,"" the agency said.
It highlighted the explosive growth in electronic commerce. But it said digitization was aimed at the use of mature technologies, such as broadband, rather than the internet and artificial intelligence.
Panama, Peru and Chile should score the best performances in the year, with expansions of 12%, 9.5% and 8%, respectively, it said. Brazil, the top economy in the region, should grow by 4.5%, while Mexico was set to advance 5.8% and Argentina, 6.3%.

While the upward trajectory of commodity prices should benefit Latin America this year, ECLAC said its duration going forward was uncertain.
Despite the increase in employment in the first quarter of 2021, the region had so far only recovered 58% of the total jobs that have been lost during the pandemic.

Businesses have reopened at a rapid clip, boosted by a rollback in restrictions now that more than 155 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. Still, the job market rebound has been anything but steady despite recent employment gains.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 373,000 for the week ended July 3, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 350,000 applications for the latest week.

Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have been cited for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There were a record 9.2 million job openings at the end of May and 9.5 million people were officially unemployed in June.
The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid declined 145,000 to 3.339 million during the week ended June 26, the claims report showed. There were 14.2 million people receiving benefits under all programs in late June, a fall from 14.7 million earlier in the month.
The data comes on the heels of an encouraging monthly jobs report from the Labor Department last Friday, which showed U.S. companies hired the most workers in 10 months in June.
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020 but remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is seen as consistent with a healthy labor market.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it smooths out week-to-week volatility, fell 250 to 394,750.
The claims data may remain volatile in the coming weeks as 25 states with mostly Republican governors pull out of federal government-funded unemployment programs. These included a $300 weekly check, which businesses complained was encouraging the jobless to stay at home. 

Those collecting benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation programs dropped by nearly 465,000 in the week ended June 19, the largest decline since early May. At a combined 10.7 million, their rolls were the lowest since the start of the year. 
The early termination of aid began on June 5 and will run through July 31, when Louisiana, the only one of those states with a Democratic governor, ends the weekly check. For the rest of the country, these benefits will lapse on Sept. 6.

51,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2021 08:12AM ET</span>",UK employers and consumers unfazed by Delta coronavirus variant,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -The number of British staff on furlough fell to a new low last month as employers struggled to fill vacancies and consumers appeared to shrug off a new rise in COVID-19 cases, adding to signs of recovery as restrictions are lifted.
Britain's economy has rebounded in recent months after 2020's record slump, but some analysts worry that growth could be dampened by any further surge in coronavirus infections caused by the more contagious Delta variant.
Businesses reported that the proportion of staff on furlough dropped to 5% in the last two weeks of June from 6% in the first half of the month, the Office for National Statistics said.
Almost a third of workers were furloughed at the peak of the job-support programme in May 2020. The scheme is due to end on Sept. 30.
Many businesses are reporting difficulty recruiting staff, especially in sectors such as hospitality which shed employees during the pandemic and relied heavily on workers from the European Union before Britain left the bloc.
The Recruitment and Employment Confederation said businesses were hiring staff at the fastest rate since it started collecting records in the late 1990s.
Figures from recruiter Adzuna showed the number of online job adverts as of July 2 was 35% higher than in February 2020 - before the pandemic's impact was felt in Britain - and up 4% on the previous week.
Though COVID-19 cases have hit their highest level since January, the government says it is confident the roll-out of vaccines means there will be fewer hospital admissions and deaths.
It plans to lift most remaining restrictions on public events and social distancing in pubs and restaurants on July 19, after a four-week delay intended to allow more vaccinations.
ECONOMY NOT YET RECOVERED
The economy as a whole is not expected to regain its pre-crisis size until the end of 2021, in contrast to the much faster recovery in the United States. Spending remains below pre-pandemic levels and a peak hit earlier this year.
Weekly Bank of England data showed consumer spending on credit and debit cards rose by 3 percentage points to 96% of its February 2020 level in the week to July 1 although it was below its level a month earlier.
Spending on socialising rose to 84% of its pre-pandemic level from 80% the previous week, but remained the weakest of the four main categories in the data.
A separate survey suggested Britons were again close to the recent peak level of confidence seen in May, when some COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. There was a dip in June when cases of the Delta variant rose.
The daily survey, conducted by data company Morning Consult https://morningconsult.com/2021/07/07/uk-consumer-confidence, showed consumer confidence in Britain was below pre-pandemic levels but had recovered quickly from the Delta dip, as it did after cases were detected of an earlier strain of COVID-19.

""The impact of increases in cases resulting from the Delta variant is very different to the impact of the increases in cases in February 2020,"" Morning Consult's chief economist John Leer said. ""It becomes easier for consumers to shake off increases in cases realising that hospitalisations and deaths are so much lower than they were before.""
But consumers in Britain, as elsewhere in Europe, the United States and China, were showing signs of uncertainty about the longer-term effects of the pandemic on the economy, and this could limit spending growth, Leer said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment index rose for the first time in three months in June, a government survey showed Thursday,
even as the government prepared to declare a state of emergency for Tokyo to curb a new wave of coronavirus infections.
The index, which rose 9.5 points to 47.6 in June, is based on a survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff who are called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends.
While that index focused on prevailing business conditions, a separate index measuring the outlook for future conditions improved for a second straight month, gaining 4.8 points to 52.4 in June. 
Some analysts say the improvement could prove temporary given that the plans for a fourth round of coronavirus emergency measures in Tokyo from next week through August 22, to make the capital safer while it hosts the Olympic Games.
Based on the survey, the Cabinet Office upgraded its view of the economy, saying it was ""picking up"", albeit from a severe condition. 
Having also sounded a cautiously optimistic note, the Bank of Japan is set to hold a policy review on July 15-16, when it will give its latest projections for growth and inflation.

Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in the first quarter and likely grew only modestly in the April-June period.
Many analysts expect consumption to remain a soft, due in part to a slow vaccine roll-out.

Taiwan has been encouraging its firms to invest at home, having seen companies flock back to the island during the China-U.S. trade war, to avoid being affected by punitive tariffs both of those countries have imposed on imports from each other.
The Cabinet said in a statement that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, there had been no let up in investment by companies in Taiwan, where the economy and especially the tech exports have continued to boom, driven by demand globally from people working and studying from home during lockdowns.
With more than 50 companies awaiting approval for investment projects, and to encourage more, the Cabinet said it would offer another T$150 billion in loans to help with financing, after previous funding was used up.
Export-dependent Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors, a shortage of which has impacted global auto makers in particular, and Taiwan companies are ramping up capacity to meet the demand.
Taiwan's exports in the first half of this year exceed $200 billion, a record high, driven in large part by its tech and chip products.
""It is remarkable that we can still have such a performance during the epidemic,"" the Cabinet said.

The government said more than 900 companies have increased their presence in Taiwan in the past two years during the trade war, investing more than T$1.2 trillion.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese bank lending rose at its slowest annual pace in more than eight years in June as corporate fund demand to weather coronavirus-linked cash constraints subsided, central bank data showed on Thursday.
Total deposits parked at commercial banks continued to rise and hit a fresh record last month, the data showed, as companies and households held off on spending.
The figures underscore the view that many companies are emerging from the pandemic's immediate hit, but holding onto cash on uncertainty over the economic outlook.
""The balance of bank lending remains at elevated levels, but corporate fund demand seems to be subsiding,"" a Bank of Japan official told reporters at a briefing.
Total outstanding loans held by Japanese banks rose 1.4% in June from a year earlier to 578 trillion yen ($5.23 trillion), BOJ data showed, the slowest growth rate since January 2013.
Major banks saw lending fall 1.6% last month, posting the first year-on-year decline since November 2012, as some big borrowers paid back loans thanks to higher profits.
Total deposits held by banks stood at 834 trillion yen, hitting a fresh record.
Japan has not experienced the kind of explosive COVID-19 outbreaks seen in many other countries but has had more than 800,000 cases and 14,800 deaths.

Slow vaccine rollouts and a resurgence in infections are likely to force authorities to impose another state of emergency in Tokyo through Aug. 22, putting more pressure on a fragile economic recovery.

Vacancies also reached their highest level since the launch of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation's (REC) survey almost 24 years ago.
""Recruiters are working flat out to fill roles across our economy,"" Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, said. ""The jobs market is improving at the fastest pace we have ever seen, but it is still an unpredictable time.""
Britain's labour market was supported through lockdowns by the government's huge job subsidy programme and hiring is bouncing back as the economy reopens.
Most remaining COVID restrictions are due to end in England on July 19, allowing pubs and restaurants to serve greater numbers of customers and large-scale public events to resume.
But with many foreign workers leaving Britain during the coronavirus pandemic, the search for staff has become a problem for many firms.
The REC survey showed starting salaries jumped by the most since 2014 and a rise in hourly pay rates for short-term staff was the strongest since 2004, something the Bank of England will note as it assesses how temporary a recent rise in inflation is likely to prove.
Carberry said the phasing out of the government's coronavirus emergency job subsidies between July and the end of September might mean more people would be looking for work.
British recruiters PageGroup and Robert Walters both raised profit forecasts on Wednesday due to increased hiring in a number of countries where they operate.
But PageGroup's chief executive said it was too soon to know if the surge in hiring represented temporary pent-up demand or the start of a longer-term increase.
A separate survey, published by the British Chambers of Commerce, underscored the problems faced by many employers looking to hire workers as the economy reopens.
The BCC said 52% of firms attempted to recruit in the second quarter of 2021, the most since immediately before the pandemic hit Britain. Some 70% of them reported difficulties finding staff, up 7 percentage points from the first quarter. 

The sector with the highest proportion of firms reporting difficulties was construction at 82%, followed by hotels and catering at 76%.
Nearly 40% of firms expected to expand their workforce in the next quarter, higher than a pre-pandemic 2018-19 average of 29%, the BCC said.

CRYSTAL LAKE, Ill. (Reuters) - President Joe Biden made the case for spending trillions of dollars on U.S. infrastructure, paid for by higher taxes on corporations, at an Illinois community college on Wednesday, as opposition builds from U.S. business groups.
In a speech Biden focused on what he called ""human infrastructure"" priorities that did not make it into a $1.2 trillion bipartisan deal struck with Republicans.
The policies include tax rebates for parents, free preschool and community college, healthcare and clean energy subsidies as well as 12 weeks of paid medical leave, financed by raising corporate taxes on U.S. companies.
Biden said a minimum tax of 15% on companies that manage to avoid paying taxes would raise $240 billion and could be used to finance his plans, which he acknowledged are ""really expensive""
""The fact is that it is paid for,"" he said. ""Everybody has to pay their fair share. I'm not trying to gouge anybody. They've just got to get in the game,"" he said.
Corporations currently supply less than 10% of U.S. tax revenue, down from nearly 40% in the 1940s. 
The Biden administration's bedrock economic argument is neither corporations nor wealthy Americans are paying their ""fair share"" to support research, education, infrastructure and workers in the world's largest economy. 
The International Monetary Fund projects 2021 U.S. growth at 7.0%, one of the strongest recoveries worldwide from the recession induced by the COVID-19 pandemic, if Biden's plans are enacted.
Speaking at McHenry County College in Crystal Lake, Illinois, near Chicago, Biden said Illinois has 2,374 bridges and more than 6,200 miles of highways in need of repair and that one of every 10 people in the state lacks access to high speed internet.
Democrats hope that most of the proposals not in the bipartisan bill will pass under a budget mechanism that would require only a simple majority in the U.S. Congress, bypassing Republicans, who oppose any new corporate taxes.
Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday vowed a ""hell of a fight for what this country ought to look like in the future"" over the tax and spending issue.
Biden shrugged off McConnell's comments and said McConnell had talked about how his home state of Kentucky would benefit from infrastructure spending. ""He's bragging about it in Kentucky,"" Biden said.

U.S. business lobbying groups who backed the bipartisan plan are gearing up to fight https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-lobby-groups-write-battle-plan-beat-biden-tax-hikes-2021-07-06 looming corporate tax hikes, using the same argument they employed in 2017 to secure huge tax cuts from Republicans: higher corporate taxes equal fewer jobs.
""We don't know what's in that package,"" Rachelle Bernstein, chief tax counsel for a retail lobby group, said of the Democrats' bill. ""But we don't think it is good to use a corporate tax increase to finance spending.""

The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew close to 1% in the second quarter from the previous three months, up from a previous estimate of half a percentage point, the central bank said.
The government ended France's third national lockdown in mid-May and has been gradually relaxing other restrictions since then.
The economy was seen operating at 98% of pre-crisis levels in June and July, up from 96% in May, the central bank said in a note accompanying its monthly survey of 8,500 businesses.
A growing number of companies reported trouble finding enough staff and getting hold of raw materials as the economy re-opened.
The survey found 47% of industrial companies were facing supply-chain problems in June, up from 44% in May while the number hit as high as 80% in the carmaking sector.

Manufacturers' stocks of raw materials were the lowest on record going back to the early 1980s, while price increases for inputs were the highest since the early 1980s.
Meanwhile, 44% of the companies surveyed said they were having trouble recruiting enough workers in June, up from 37% in May. The number reached as high as 50% in the construction sector and 47% in services.

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose by 16,000 to 9.2 million on the last day of May, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Wednesday.
Hiring also dipped to 5.9 million in May from 6.0 million in the prior month. The government reported last Friday that job growth accelerated in June as U.S. companies hired the most workers in 10 months.
""The latest survey data suggest that labor shortages remain acute,"" said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.

The number of people re-entering the workforce has lagged job openings as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 9 million people remain officially unemployed. A lack of affordable childcare in particular has been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, on the sidelines while others have stayed home due to lingering fears about the virus.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 9.39 million in May. Vacancies were little changed in all four regions and the job openings rate was unchanged at 6.0%. 
Graphic: Job openings are at a record high - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/azgvoqyjdvd/chart_eikon.jpg 
Unfilled vacancies increased by 109,000 in other services and there were an additional 46,000 job openings in state and local government education. Vacancies declined in state and local government and the federal government.
The report also showed the number of people voluntarily leaving their employment in May fell to 3.6 million from 4.0 million in April, although quits levels still rose in the leisure and hospitality, and accommodation and food services sectors. The quits rate is usually seen as a barometer of job market confidence.
People quitting their jobs now accounts for more than two-thirds of all job separations and remains well above pre-pandemic levels.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian retail sales rose in May for a second month in a row, figures showed on Wednesday, with a strong upward revision for April suggesting consumers are shrugging off the COVID-19 pandemic and driving the broader economic recovery.
Figures from government statistics agency IBGE showed that the rise in retail sales in May was broad-based, and means total volumes were almost 4% above the pre-pandemic levels of early last year.
Sales excluding autos and construction materials rose a seasonally adjusted 1.4% in May from April. That was less than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for a 2.4% rise, but April's 1.8% rise was revised sharply higher to an increase of 4.9%.
IBGE survey manager Cristiano Santos urged caution, however.
""This is a recovery, but from a very low base,"" he said.
Sales jumped 16.0% on a year-on-year basis, boosted by base effects following the steep decline in May last year. That was slightly less than the 16.5% rise forecast in the Reuters poll.
IBGE said month-on-month sales rose in seven of the eight categories surveyed in May, led by a 16.8% rise in clothing and footwear and a 6.8% increase in fuel sales. The only sector to post a fall in sales was pharmaceutical and cosmetics goods.
So far this year, retail sales are up 6.8% from the January-May period last year, IBGE said, although still 1.3% below the record high from October last year.

On a wider basis, including cars and building materials, retail sales in May rose 3.8% on the month, jumped 26.2% on the year, and are up 12.4% so far this year, IBGE said.
By this measure, however, retail sales in Brazil were still down 3.4% from their peak in August 2012, IBGE said.

The tourism-reliant country's biggest outbreak that emerged in April has seen the most cases and deaths, dealing a deeper blow to an already fragile economic recovery.
""The rapid and severe third wave has affected domestic demand although a clear global economic recovery will benefit Thai exports,"" Payong Srivanich, chairman of the joint-business group of industry, banking and commerce, told a briefing.
The group raised its export growth forecast to 8% to 10% this year from 5% to 7% due to better-than-expected global demand but cited infections at factories as a risk.
In the first five months of 2021, exports rose 10.78% from a year earlier, customs data showed.

If the outbreak cannot be controlled, more restrictions are imposed and foreign tourist numbers miss targets, the economy is likely to contract this year, Supant Mongkolsuthree, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries, told the briefing.

The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output decreased by 0.3% on the month after an upwardly revised decline of 0.3% in April. A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 0.5%.
The fall was driven by a plunge in the production of capital goods, such as machinery and vehicles, which fell 3.4%, the data showed. Consumer, intermediate goods and construction output rose.
Compared with February 2020, the month before the start of the coronavirus restrictions, production was down 5% in seasonally and calendar adjusted terms. 
The economy ministry said the decline was mainly due to semiconductor bottlenecks which are hitting the automotive sector, but said the forecast for the economy remained positive due to strong demand and optimistic export expectations.
Investor sentiment in Germany remained at a very high level in July despite a bigger-than-expected drop as forecasts for a strong economic recovery rose, a survey showed on Tuesday.

Thomas Gitzel, an economist at VP bank, said the supply crunch slowing down production might temper some economists' growth forecasts.
""Economists who started the year with an overly optimistic growth forecast will have to apply the red pen,"" he said.

Prices were 0.5% lower than in May, Halifax said. In annual terms, they stood 8.8% higher than in June 2020 after leaping by the most in 14 years in May when they rose 9.6%.
""It is important to put such a moderate decrease in context, with average prices still more than 21,000 pounds ($29,000)higher than this time last year, following a broadly unprecedented period of gains,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said.
Last week, rival lender Nationwide said its measure of house prices showed a 13.4% leap between June 2020 and June 2021, the biggest increase in over 16 years.
Britain's housing market has been spurred on by finance minister Rishi Sunak's COVID-19 emergency tax break for buyers many of whom were already seeking bigger properties as they increasingly work from home because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The tax exemption on the first 500,000 pounds of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland expired at the end of June. A 250,000 pound tax-free allowance will run until the end of September.
Galley said demand from people looking for bigger homes would not fade entirely as the economy recovers and the shortage of properties on the market would also support prices.
""However, we would still expect annual growth to have slowed somewhat more by the end of the year, with unemployment expected to edge higher as job support measures unwind, and the peak of buyer demand now likely to have passed,"" he said.

Prices in London rose by a below-average 2.9% in annual terms in June, slowing from May. All other regions of the United Kingdom, except for the Midlands, saw prices rise more quickly than in May.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity grew at a moderate pace in June, likely restrained by labor and raw material shortages, resulting in unfinished work continuing to pile up.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Tuesday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to 60.1 last month from 64.0 in May, which was the highest reading in the series' history. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index easing to 63.5. 
The economy has been hit by shortages of labor and raw materials as it reopens after more than a year of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 150 million people are fully immunized against the coronavirus, resulting in the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions on businesses and mask mandates, helping demand to revert back to services from goods. 
The survey's measure of backlog orders increased to a reading of 65.8 from 61.1 in May. New orders remained healthy and there is ample scope for hefty gains in the months ahead, with inventories contracting in June. Inventory sentiment among customers remained poor. Business inventories were depleted in the first quarter amid pent-up demand. 
With supply constraints showing no sign of letting up, businesses continued to pay more for inputs. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries dipped to a still-high 79.5 from 80.6 in May, which was the highest reading since September 2005. The continued elevation supports some economists' view that higher inflation to prove to be more persistent than currently envisioned by the Federal Reserve.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory noting that he expected supply chains to normalize and adapt, views also shared by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. 
The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target, the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, shot up 3.4% year-on-year in May, the largest gain since April 1992. 

The ISM survey's measure of service employment fell to a reading of 49.3 in June from 55.3 in May. There is, however, cautious optimism that the worker shortage is starting to ease.
The government reported on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 850,000 jobs in June, the largest gain in 10 months, after rising 583,000 in May.

The ZEW economic research institute said its survey of sentiment among investors fell to 63.3 points from 79.8 in the previous month. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall to 75.2.
But a separate ZEW gauge of current conditions surged to 21.9 from -9.1 points in June, moving into positive territory for the first time in two years and easily beating a consensus forecast for 5.0 points.
""The economic development continues to normalise,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. ""In the meantime, the situation indicator for Germany has clearly overcome the coronavirus-related decline.""
He added: ""The financial market experts therefore expect the overall economic situation to be extraordinarily positive in the coming six months.""
Separate data on Tuesday from the Federal Statistics Office showed that orders for German-made goods posted their sharpest slump in May since the first lockdown in 2020.
That reflected weaker demand from countries outside the euro zone and fewer contracts for machinery and intermediate goods.
Orders for industrial goods fell 3.7% on the month in seasonally adjusted terms -- the first drop in new business this year.

Carsten Brzeski of ING said the decline largely reflected supply chain disruptions, delivery delays and lack of materials and intermediate goods. 
""Today's disappointing industrial orders are no reason to be concerned,"" he wrote in a note. ""Order books are more than richly filled and reducing backlogs is a bigger problem for German companies than acquiring new orders.""

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh's exports jumped 15% to $38.76 billion in the financial year ended June, data showed on Tuesday, led by a rebound in demand for garments as Western economies recovered.
The world's second-largest apparel producer after China took a roughly $6 billion hit in the 2019-20 financial year, with overseas apparel sales falling 18% to $27.94 billion.
Garment exports rose 13% to $31.5 billion in 2020/21 from a year earlier, thanks to a 21% surge in overseas sales of knitwear products such as t-shirts and sweaters, but were 7% below the pre-pandemic period of 2018-19 financial year, the Export Promotion Bureau said.
Sales of woven garments, such as formal denim shirts and pants, rose only 3%, which exporters attributed to tepid demand as more people worked from home and avoided social gatherings.
Bangladesh's exports in June grew at a record pace of 31% from a year earlier to $3.58 billion, led by more orders from the United States and Europe, the main destinations of apparel sales.
Garment industry leaders said they expect exports to increase but rising costs of freight and raw materials could hold back growth.
""Order flow is satisfactory. But freight costs and cotton prices are rising up, that could hamper our exports"" Shahidullah Azim, vice president of the Bangladesh Garments Exporters and Manufacturers Association, said.
""Our garment factories are largely unaffected by the latest pandemic situation at home but we need to control it soon,"" said Azim, who supplies European and North American retailers.
Bangladesh is currently battling a record spike in coronavirus cases, prompting the government to extend its strictest lockdown to July 14. Garment factories, however, are allowed to operate observing health protocols. 
Some garment workers are happy as they are able to earn overtime wages, which often account for 20% of their monthly income.

""I am really happy that I can earn some more doing overtime. There was a time when we went to the factory and sat idle all day as there were no orders,"" said Munna Khan, a worker in Gazipur, on the outskirt of the capital city Dhaka.
Low wages have helped Bangladesh build its garment industry, with some 4,000 factories employing 4 million workers, supplying brands such as H&M and GAP. Readymade garments are a mainstay of the economy, accounting for almost 16% of the country's GDP.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction industry recorded its fastest growth in 24 years last month, bolstered by a jump in demand for new homes and commercial property, but the sector was beset by a record rise in the cost of raw materials.
The monthly purchasing managers' index data underscored the speed of Britain's broader economic rebound as coronavirus restrictions ease, and also how bottlenecks in supply chains are creating inflation pressures.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction PMI jumped to 66.3 in June from 64.2 in May, its highest since June 1997 and above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Britain's housing market has been boosted by a tax break for home-buyers which finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to phase out by the end of September.
The PMI's input cost component was the highest since the series started in April 1997, and delivery times were the longest on record too.
""Supply chains once again struggled to keep up with demand for construction products and materials,"" IHS Markit's economics director Tim Moore said.
The Bank of England last month said it expected inflation to peak above 3% but it predicts https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2E73SB the bottlenecks that are partly behind the rise will prove temporary.
Construction slumped at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic but recovered faster than other parts of Britain's economy as it was less affected by social-distancing restrictions and benefited from booming house prices https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/uk-house-prices-jump-by-134-12-months-june-nationwide-2021-06-29.
Official data https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp/bulletins/gdpmonthlyestimateuk/april2021#the-construction-sector showed that construction output in April was slightly above its pre-pandemic level.
Confidence among purchasing managers remained high but weakened to its lowest since January, partly due to rising costs and difficulties hiring construction workers.

""Escalating cost pressures and concerns about labour availability appear to have constrained business optimism at some building firms,"" Moore said.

This represented 4.5% of overall employees after 6.8% in May, Ifo said, adding that the estimate was based on a business survey and data from the Federal Labour Office.
In the hospitality sector, the number of people on the schemes fell to 331,000 in June from 520,000 in May, Ifo said, adding that more than 30% of staff in the sector were still on short-time work.

Ifo said supply bottlenecks for raw materials have not yet impacted on the number of short-time workers in the industry.
Short-time work allows employers to switch staff onto shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. It aims to prevent shocks such as the coronavirus crisis leading to mass unemployment.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's business confidence improved sharply in the second quarter as the COVID-free economy surged, prompting the New Zealand dollar to surge as investors brought forward rate hike expectations.
A net 7% of firms surveyed expected general business conditions to improve, compared with a 13% predicting a deterioration in the previous quarter, the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion (QSBO) showed.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, 10% expected business conditions to improve, swinging from 8% who had expected a deterioration in the previous survey.
Firms also reported they were finding it more difficult than ever before to hire skilled labour.
Economists at Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) and ASB Bank reckoned resulting inflationary pressures were enough to justify pulling forward their expectations for interest rate hikes to November 2021.
The New Zealand dollar rose 0.6% to $0.7075, the yield on two-year sovereign bonds jumped nearly 10 basis points and swaps pricing rose to reflect a risk of hiking as soon as November. 
The only other major market where a rate rise is expected this year is Norway, whose central bank has projected an increase in the third or fourth quarter.
""Today's data confirm our view that the only questions now are when will rates rise and by how much,"" BNZ economists said in a note. ""The when has clearly moved closer and so we formally move our rate hike call to November 2021.""
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) held interest rates in May but hinted at a hike as early as September 2022, becoming one of the first advanced economies to signal a move away from the stimulatory settings adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RBNZ's next monetary policy review is due next week.
The NZIER survey's measure of capacity utilisation was 94.9% from the previous quarter's 93.9%.
Firms also reported a sharp upturn in their trading activity, with a net 26% of businesses reporting that they expected demand to have increased in the June quarter, compared with just 2% who had expected demand to have increased in the previous survey.
Labour shortages and supply chain disruptions are leading to a further build-up of capacity pressures and point to rising inflation, NZIER said.
""The increase in both costs and prices points to rising inflation pressures, which is underpinning expectations of interest rate increases from the Reserve Bank over the coming year,"" NZIER said in a statement.

About 60% of financial services sector firms now expect interest rates to rise over the coming year, it said.
""It is very clear that record amounts of monetary stimulus are no longer needed to support the economy,"" ASB analysts said in a note which brought forward their hike projections from May 2022 to November.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2021 10:10PM ET</span>",Japan's May household spending growth slows from previous month,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's household spending rose at a double-digit rate in May as consumers bought cars and mobile phones, though the pace of growth slowed from the prior month as a new wave of COVID-19 infections weighed on consumer confidence.
Japan's economy is struggling to shake off the drag from the coronavirus pandemic after the government put in place ""quasi-emergency"" measures in Tokyo and other major areas to curb a resurgence of infections.
Household spending grew 11.6% year-on-year in May, the third month of gains, after a 13.0% rise in April, government data showed on Tuesday. That was stronger than a median market forecast for a 10.9% gain in a Reuters poll.
But the gains were heavily skewed by the recoil effect from last year's plunge, when the pandemic and a nationwide state of emergency shuttered businesses and disrupted day to day life.
Stripping out big-ticket items like housing, cars and gifts, household spending was up 8.9% year-on-year, but down 6.5% compared to the same month two years earlier - a sign the recovery is taking time to bed in.
""It will be hard for services spending to recover if curbs on economic activity are not lifted completely,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""While the vaccination rollout is progressing more quickly than thought, its (economic) impact may not be seen until September or later.""
The month-on-month figures showed a 2.1% contraction compared with a forecast decline of 3.7%, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications data showed.
While May's expenditure declined less from the previous month than thought, weak car sales in June - partly due to the impact on supply of a semiconductor shortage - were likely to weigh on last month's spending, Tsunoda said.
The spending growth in May is unlikely to dispel worries that Japan is lagging recoveries seen in other major economies such as the United States, which the International Monetary Fund is forecasting to grow 7.0% this year - the fastest pace in a generation.
The combination of the risk of another spike in infections and a late vaccination drive in the nation has dented both consumer and business confidence.
Separate data on Tuesday showed inflation-adjusted real wages in May posted the biggest year-on-year rise since June 2018, in part due to a year-on-year surge in overtime pay.

Some analysts fear Japan's economy may fall back into recession in the second quarter, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, as consumer and business confidence took a hit from measures to stem a rise in coronavirus infections.
On Monday, a private business survey showed Japan's services sector activity shrank for the 17th straight month in June.

By Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - The market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) surged to new highs in the second quarter, with $2.5 billion in sales so far this year, up from just $13.7 million in the first half of 2020, marketplace data showed.
An NFT is a crypto asset, representing an intangible digital item such as an image, video, or in-game item. Owners of NFTs are recorded on blockchain, allowing an NFT to be traded as a stand-in for the digital asset it represents.
Sales volumes have remained high after NFTs exploded in popularity early this year. Monthly sales volumes on OpenSea, a major NFT marketplace, reached a record high in June. 
(GRAPHIC: NFT sales on OpenSea near $150m in June - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/azgvoqjajvd/chart.png) 
Some NFT enthusiasts see them as collectibles with intrinsic value because of their cultural significance, while others treat them as an investment, speculating on rising prices. 
Buyers have mostly totalled 10,000 to 20,000 per week since March, outnumbering sellers, according to NonFungible.com, which aggregates NFT transactions on the ethereum blockchain. 
(GRAPHIC: Weekly NFT buyers - NonFungible.com - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/jbyprzxebpe/chart.png) 
Total sales volume estimates vary depending on which NFT transactions are included.
DappRadar, which tracks sales across multiple blockchains, said volumes hit just under $2.5 billion for the first half of 2021. But NonFungible.com's figure is $1.3 billion, excluding around $8 billion of ""DeFi"" (decentralised finance) NFTs.

(GRAPHIC: Weekly NFT sales volume - NonFungible.com - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/dgkplrjagpb/chart.png) 
Both sites only track sales which occur on the blockchain, also known as ""on-chain"" transactions. Some of the biggest NFT sales, such as those at auction houses, have part of the transaction take place ""off-chain"", meaning they must be manually added to the data.
In March, a digital image sold for a record $69.3 million at Christie's as an NFT. No NFT sale has come close since. The second most expensive known NFT sale was a ""CryptoPunk"" which fetched $11.8 million at Sotheby's. 
(GRAPHIC: Sports and collectible NFTs are most popular - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/xlbvgqwwyvq/chart.png) 
The U.S. National Basketball Association Top Shot marketplace, which allows fans to buy and trade NFTs in the form of video highlights, has seen volumes shrink and buyers drop to 246,000 in June from 403,000 in March. The average price of a Top Shot ""moment"" slumped to $27 in June, after peaking at $182 in February. 
(GRAPHIC: NBA Top Shot sales fall - https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-NFT/DATA/ygdvzznnmvw/chart.png) 

But as some NFT types become less popular, others take off. 
The Bored Ape Yacht Club, a set of 10,000 unique digital ape NFTs, has become a hit among collectors. The average ape sold on OpenSea as of July 1 for $3,600, up 1,574% from the launch price of $215 in April. Total sales have jumped to $61 million, according to the club's creators, U.S.-based Yuga Labs.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone businesses expanded activity at the fastest rate in 15 years in June as the easing of more coronavirus restrictions brought life back to the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed on Monday.
But that surge in growth has come at a cost as inflationary pressures mounted due to labour shortages and disruptions to supply chains caused by the pandemic.
IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, jumped to 59.5 last month from May's 57.1, its highest level since June 2006.
That was ahead of the 59.2 ""flash"" estimate and well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""The index was at its 15-year high, confirming that the recovery in bloc's economy is well underway. At the same time, backlogs and producer price pressures show no signs of abating,"" said Mateusz Urban at Oxford Economics.
""The services PMI sub-index posted an increase. This indicated that the sector has benefited from easing of restrictions and increased consumer optimism on the back of advancing vaccination campaign.
An acceleration in vaccination programmes on the continent has meant governments have allowed more of the services industry to re-open and the sector's PMI soared to its highest reading since July 2007.

PRICE RISE
A PMI covering euro zone manufacturers, released last week, showed factory activity expanded at its fastest pace on record in June but that they faced the steepest rise in raw materials costs in well over two decades.
Those inflationary pressures were also felt by the services industry and the composite input prices index bounced to the highest in nearly 21 years.
Although inflation risks are skewed to the upside the European Central Bank was expected to maintain its loose monetary policy and look through higher inflation expectations for a while before it acts, a Reuters poll found last month. [ECILT/EU]

With demand surging, and amid hopes of further easing of restrictions leading to a more normal way of life, optimism about the coming year improved. The services business expectations index climbed to 72.7 from 71.2, its highest since August 2000.
Investor morale in the euro zone rose for the fifth month in a row in July, its highest level since February 2018, lifted by reopening restaurants and retailers as well as tourism as coronavirus cases fall, another survey showed on Monday.

The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector edged down to 62.4 from 62.9 in May but was slightly higher than a preliminary June reading of 61.7. 
Job creation was the fastest for seven years but even so staff shortages contributed to the highest level of backlogs since the survey began in 1996. That in turn helped to push up prices by the most on record for inputs and prices charged.
Britain's economy slumped by nearly 10% last year as the country suffered one of the world's highest COVID-19 death tolls. 
But this year it is expected to grow faster than the United States and other advanced economies, helped by its early COVID-19 vaccination rollout and huge monetary and fiscal stimulus.
Despite the growth spurt and inflation running above its 2% target, the Bank of England has signalled it is in no rush to ease off on its support. It is waiting to see if unemployment rises as the government winds down its job subsidies over the next three months.

IHS Markit said there was a small fall in exports due to travel restrictions and uncertainty about quarantine policies. Some firms also said Brexit-related issues had dampened export orders to the European Union. 
The composite PMI, including previously released manufacturing data, also eased back, slipping to 62.2 from May's 62.9 which was the highest reading since the series began in January 1998.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 in June, the lowest since April 2020 and down significantly from 55.1 in May. It held just above the 50-mark, which separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
China's official services gauge had also shown a marked slowdown in June, though it remained well in expansion territory. The private survey is believed to focus more on smaller companies.
Coupled with a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, analysts say the PMI survey findings suggest that pent-up COVID demand may have peaked and China's robust economic rebound from the crisis is starting to moderate.
Though slower to recover from the pandemic than manufacturing, a gradual improvement in consumption in recent months had boosted China's services sector.
However, a COVID-19 outbreak of the more infectious Delta strain in the export and manufacturing hub of Guangdong since late May and the subsequent imposition of anti-virus measures have weighed on consumer and business activity.
While the government reacted quickly to contain the new wave of cases, and economic disruptions are easing, the private survey showed services providers' business outlook for the year ahead slipped to the lowest in nine months.
A sub-index of new business stood at 50.5, also the lowest since April 2020 when the services sector was still mired in COVID paralysis. Firms also cut staff in June for the first time in four months, as a result of slowing demand. 
One bright spot in the survey was a marked easing in inflationary pressures, which have squeezed profit margins. Input costs rose at the slowest pace since September 2020, and services firms cut their prices charged for the first time in 11 months to win new business. 
Caixin's June composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activity, fell to a 14-month low of 50.6 from May's 53.8. 

""The manufacturing industry has returned to normal in the wake of the epidemic, while the services industry is still sensitive to regional resurgences,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group.
""In addition, the low base effect from last year will continue to weaken in the second half of this year. Inflationary pressure, intertwined with the economic slowdown, will still be a serious challenge.""

Investing.com – China's Caixin survey said on Monday that China’s services sector grew at a slower pace in June, a 14-month low, due to a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Guangdong province. The survey also indicated that the economic recovery of the world’s second-largest economy may have started to slow down.
Data released earlier in the day said that the Caixin services purchasing managers index (PMI) in June was at 50.3, the lowest since April 2020. It was lower than May’s 55.1 figure but remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
Meanwhile, Caixin manufacturing PMI in June, released on Thursday, was at 51.3, below the 51.8 figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and May’s 52 reading.
The data suggested that demand may have peaked in both the manufacturing and services sectors, and China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 is slowing down, some investors told Reuters.
Although China’s services sector rebounded slower than the manufacturing sector, it had been boosted by a gradual improvement in consumption in the previous months. However, an outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangdong province since late May and restrictive measures to curb the spread of the outbreak hurt consumer and business activity.
Even as the government took immediate measures to curb the virus' spread, the Caixin survey indicated that services providers' business outlook for the year ahead decreased to the lowest in nine months.
""The manufacturing industry has returned to normal in the wake of COVID-19, while the services industry is still sensitive to regional resurgences,"" Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, told Reuters.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australian job advertisements extended their record-breaking run in June as demand for labour remained strong despite a round of coronavirus lockdowns across the country, a sign any drag on the economy will likely be fleeting.
Other data out on Monday showed retail sales topped forecasts in May with a rise of 0.4%, while sales of new vehicles held firm in June, in a promising omen for consumption.
Approvals to build new homes did drop 7.1% in May from the previous month, but that followed months of gains which still left approvals up 53% on a year earlier. 
Figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group showed job ads climbed 3.0% in June from May, when they jumped 6.8%. That was the 13th straight month of gains and showed 129% growth versus a year earlier when the labour market was recovering from a national pandemic lockdown.
""Recent history shows that workers laid off or stood down during lockdowns tend to be reinstated or find new jobs quickly once restrictions lift, given the underlying strength in the labour market and overall demand,"" said ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch.
The survey came hot on the heels of government data on vacancies out last week which showed a huge 23% increase in the three months to May.
""Vacancies are twice their pre-pandemic level, and there are now 1.9 unemployed people per vacancy, easily the lowest ratio on record,"" said Birch. ""This suggests the unemployment rate has a lot further to fall.""
Unemployment has already fallen much quicker than policymakers expected and hit 5.1% in April, down from a pandemic peak of 7.5% reached in July last year.
The Reserve Bank of Australia is aiming to drive unemployment down to 4% or even lower in the hope of finally lifting wage growth and inflation after years of tepid gains.

The central bank holds its July policy meeting on Tuesday and the resilience of employment should provide the confidence to temper its massive stimulus programme.
Analysts expect it will not extend its three-year yield target to late 2024 but will announce another round of bond buying, perhaps in a more flexible manner.

The decline in the services industry kept overall private-sector activity in contraction for a second month, in a sign the country's economic recovery struggles to pick up despite making progress with a coronavirus vaccine rollout.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was at a seasonally adjusted 48.0, up from the prior month's final level of 46.5 and a 47.2 flash reading.
It meant services activity came in below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a 17th month, the longest such streak since a 27-month run through March 2010.
The PMI survey showed firms saw a slower contraction in new business, including from overseas, and grew increasingly bullish about expectations for the year ahead.
Outstanding business, however, saw a slightly faster rate of decline, suggesting many firms in the services sector are still feeling the pain from the health crisis despite their optimism conditions would improve over the year ahead.
""Businesses in the Japanese service sector reported that activity remained subdued as the country continued to battle the latest wave of COVID-19 infections,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Firms continued to build capacity in anticipation of increasing demand, though the pace of job creation eased to a four-month low.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies hired the most workers in 10 months in June, raising wages and offering incentives to entice millions of unemployed Americans sitting at home, in a tentative sign that a labor shortage hanging over the economy was starting to ease.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday showed 151,000 people entered the labor force last month, though the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one did not budge from the tight range it has been in since June 2020. 
The acceleration in hiring suggested the economy ended the second quarter with strong momentum, following a reopening made possible by vaccinations against COVID-19. 
""While businesses are still having a hard time filling positions, staffing challenges do not seem quite as dire based on today's pickup in payrolls,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The survey of establishments showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 850,000 jobs last month. The economy created 15,000 more jobs in April and May than previously reported. Employment is about 6.8 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would advance by 700,000 jobs. Women, who have been hardest hit by the pandemic, took nearly half of the jobs created last month. There are a record 9.3 million job openings.
(UNEMPLOYMENT - JOBS - FLAT VERSIONS JPG, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY-UNEMPLOYMENT/0100318Z2TX/usa-economy-unemployment.jpg) 
President Joe Biden hailed the pick-up in hiring.
""This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic as well as other elements of the American Rescue Plan,"" Biden said in remarks at the White House.
The leisure and hospitality industry added 343,000 jobs, accounting for 40% of the employment gains in June. More than 150 million people are fully immunized against COVID-19, which has led to the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions on businesses and mask mandates. Government employment jumped by 188,000 jobs, driven by state and local government education, which were boosted by fewer end-of-school-year layoffs relative to the previous year. 
Manufacturing added a modest 15,000 jobs, with employment at motor vehicle assembly plants declining 12,300. A global semiconductor shortage has forced some automakers to cut production. Other manufacturing industries are also grappling with shortages of raw materials and workers.
Construction payrolls contracted for the third straight month. Though the sector remains supported by robust demand for housing, scarcity of workers and expensive raw materials like framing lumber are hampering homebuilding.
Politicians, businesses and some economists have blamed enhanced unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly check from the government, for the labor crunch. Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have also been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home.
There have also been pandemic-related retirements as well as career changes. Economists generally expect the labor supply squeeze to ease in the fall as schools reopen and the government-funded unemployment benefits lapse, but they caution that many unemployed will probably never return to work.
Record-high U.S. stock prices and surging home values have also encouraged early retirements. About 3.4 million people have dropped out of the labor force since February 2020.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite hitting record highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RISES
Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% last month, led by low-wage industries, after gaining 0.4% in May. That raised the year-on-year increase in wages to 3.6% from 1.9% in May. Annual wage growth was in part flattered by so-called base effects following a big drop last June. 
According to job search engine Indeed, 4.1% of job postings advertised hiring incentives through the seven days ending June 18, more than double the 1.8% share in the week ending July 1, 2020. The incentives, which included signing bonuses, retention bonuses or one-time cash payments on being hired, ranged from as low as $100 to as high as $30,000 in the month ended June 18. 
Some restaurant jobs are paying as much as $27 per hour plus tips, according to postings on Poachedjobs.com, a national job board for the restaurant/hospitality industry. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, but some states have higher minimum wages.
The average workweek dipped to 34.7 hours from 34.8 hours. With employment not expected to return to its pre-pandemic level until sometime in 2022, rising wages are unlikely to worry Federal Reserve officials even as inflation is heating up because of supply constraints. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said he expects high inflation will be transitory.
The U.S. central bank last month opened talks on how to end its crisis-era massive bond-buying.
""We still think Fed officials will need to see several more months of strengthening to achieve their 'substantial further progress' tapering criterion,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York.
Details of the smaller and volatile household survey, from which the unemployment rate is derived, were mixed. Household employment fell 18,000 in June. But according to Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), adjusting ""the household measure to match the employment concept used in the establishment survey the figure was up 604,000.""
(Graphic: In any given month ..., https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/PAYROLLS-SURVEYS/yzdpxlqajpx/chart.png) 
The unemployment rate rose to 5.9% from 5.8% in May. The jobless rate continued to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this misclassification, the unemployment rate would have been 6.1% in June.

But the number of people working part-time for economic reasons declined 644,000. As a result, a broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to a 15-month low of 9.8% from 10.2% in May.
Women continued to trickle back, with 148,000 re-joining the labor force. That lifted women's labor force participation rate to 57.5% from 57.4%. The overall participation rate was unchanged at 61.6%.

Manufacturing accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Massive fiscal stimulus boosted demand for long-lasting manufactured goods during the COVID-19 pandemic, with millions of American working from home and learning remotely. 
Factories are struggling to keep up as the pandemic fractured supply chains and disrupted the global shipping industry. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Thursday that manufacturing activity grew moderately in June.
Factory goods orders in June were boosted by a 7.7% surge in orders for transportation equipment. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 1.3%.

Unfilled orders at factories rose 0.8% after gaining 0.4% in April. The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, edged up 0.1% in May instead of dipping 0.1% as reported last month.

Non farm payrolls increased by 850,000 jobs last month after rising 583,000 in May, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. The unemployment rate rose to 5.9% from 5.8% in May.

COMMENTS:
DARRELL CRONK, CIO, WELLS FARGO WEALTH & INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK
    ""For capital markets, equities and bonds, this was a goldilocks report. It was strong enough but not too strong which is exactly what they wanted to see. If you got too strong a  report the market could've had a negative reaction saying that means the Fed can't wait two years to raise interest rates. There would've been concerns that pulls the Fed forward. This was perfect. There were enough jobs that you'd want to see but not so much that it concerns people that the Fed may have to act sooner."" 
    ""Participation looks strong. Its unchanged month over month but there's good evidence people are returning.
   ""The narrative there is we're seeing exactly what we were expecting, the services piece turning back on as the economy opens up. That's great news. That's exactly what we want at this stage of the recovery."" 
    ""Wages were strong ... It's starting it's build. I don't think we've seen the high water mark yet in wage inflation pressure.""
    ""Up to this point its been largely industrials and goods sector that's been pushing the economy forward. Services has been turned off as retail, restaurants, travel haven't been where we've wanted them to be. As that turns back on, that will put pressure on wages.""
    ""We still have upward pressure that lies before us in wages. Beyond the headline jobs number, that's the first place my eyes go to, what's happening in wages?""   
TOM DI GALOMA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SEAPORT GLOBAL HOLDINGS, NEW YORK
“The nonfarm payroll number beat fairly well, but the unemployment rate shot up a little bit, that has people baffled.”
“The (U.S. Treasury) market is kind of struggling to go to lower yields, because were already at somewhat lower levels before the data came out. The market popped but can’t seem to go lower than 1.42% right after the release (on yields on the 10-year note.)""
“Most of the gains came from the restaurant industry and education. As educators came back to work in the fall you’ll see a real drop in the unemployment rate. I think we’re geared toward a fairly decent reopening but most of it will take place in the fall.”
VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, FX STRATEGIST, UBS, NEW YORK
    ""The FX market was gearing up for a stronger number all week and you saw that in the dollar's strength. I think the bar for a positive surprise was higher as a result. We initially reacted positively to the headline, which was stronger than expected. And then moved a little lower because of some of the weaker details of the report such as the higher unemployment rate and the higher bar for a positive surprise.""
    ""Overall, we're moving in the right direction. The U.S. labor market is strong. How quickly we can eliminate slack in the labor market remains to be seen. But our view at UBS is that there is more slack than what appears at first glance. We expect more people to join the labor force in the coming months and as a result, unemployment rate will fall slowly.""
JJ KINAHAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, TD AMERITRADE, CHICAGO
“It was definitely a very encouraging number overall.""
""This definitely shows that the pace is very steady of opening things back up and that is what we want to see so that the wages aren’t too hot and some of the inflation fears get a little bit mitigated given the fact you look at the average hourly wage really isn’t up much both over month and over year. The fact we did have so many restaurant and bar jobs, even though we know those people are probably getting paid more than they were before all this, that is still a lower wage than construction, etc, which was flat once again this month.” 
JOSEPH LAVORGNA, AMERICAS CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIXIS, NEW YORK
“Big headline, the jobs market is recovering. There’s still a lot of slack, there’s just no wage pressure. 
“The labor market is looking pretty good, it’s moving in the right direction. There’s still a lot more improvement that’s needed but left to its own devices at this point, the labor market and the broader economy are going to be fine.
“I would also argue that at the margin the data we got maybe makes a little less likely you’re going to get fiscal stimulus because people will focus mostly on the headline and why does the government need to do more if the things are getting better and you’re generating substantial job gains?”
PRIYA MISRA, HEAD OF GLOBAL RATES STRATEGY, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK
“A better report should mean higher front-end rates (on U.S. Treasuries), but they didn’t last. I think the market is torn between whether to price in the market outlook or the Fed reaction.”
“If the data is better normally that should mean higher rates, but if the Fed is forced to exit faster that would slow down the economy.”
“It’s the interplay between the economic outlook and the Fed reaction function that is creating some weird dynamics.”
STEVE RICK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CUNA MUTUAL GROUP, MADISON, WISCONSIN (email)

""It’s yet another hopeful sign that this jobs report exceeded expectations. With continued rapid vaccine rollout and largely successful reopening efforts occurring across the country, cautious optimism seems warranted. The road forward looks promising as we slowly make strides to return to the robust 3.5% unemployment rate and pre-pandemic labor market conditions.
""Furthermore, U.S. household net worth has increased by $25.6 trillion since March 31st, bringing the total to $136.9 trillion. While this may be great news for some, there is strong evidence that the increase in household net worth mainly helped individuals at the upper end as most of these gains came from the stock market and real estate holdings, both of which are held by majority well-off households that tend to be white. Without programs in place to help those who are not able to participate in the market upswings, these positive numbers are less meaningful.""

The Commerce Department said on Friday that the trade gap rose 3.1% to $71.2 billion in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $71.4 billion deficit.

Goods imports rose 1.2% to $234.7 billion. Massive fiscal stimulus and a reopening economy, thanks to vaccinations against COVID-19, are fueling demand for goods and services. Raw material shortages are hampering production. Business inventories were drawn down in the first quarter.
Exports of goods gained 0.3% to $145.5 billion, a record high. With the United States leading the global economic recovery from the pandemic recession, the trade deficit has subtracted from gross domestic product growth for three straight quarters. The trend likely persisted into the second quarter.

Investing.com -- The recovery in the U.S. labor market appeared to strengthen in June, with 850,000 people finding a job, according to Labor Department figures released Friday.
The headline nonfarm payrolls number was well above a consensus forecast of 700,000. In addition, May's nonfarm payrolls gain was revised up by 24,000 to 583,000. 
Daniel Zhao, senior economist with Glassdoor, noted via Twitter that ""Job gains were most heavily concentrated in leisure and hospitality (+343,000), accounting for 40% of the gains"" in the month. 
However, other elements of the report weren't as unambiguously positive. The unemployment rate rose to 5.9% of the workforce, instead of falling to 5.7% as expected. That suggests that people who lost their jobs during the pandemic still aren't rejoining the labor force as quickly as could be hoped for. 
""Overall, this report signals incremental progress in the pace of job growth, but there’s no sign yet of a shift back into the labor force,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients. ""The missing millions are still missing,"" he said, adding that overall employment is still some 8.8 million short of its pre-pandemic trend.
U.S. stock futures gained on the news, on the perception that the weaker-looking parts of the report will provide fresh arguments for keeping unprecedented amounts of monetary stimulus in place. The Federal Reserve is still injecting $120 billion a month into the financial system through bond purchases, despite increasing signs of overheating in some areas of the economy such as the housing market, and broader signs of rising inflation in the economy at large. 
Rising wage pressures, often a key concern of inflation hawks, came out a little weaker in the report that had been expected. Average hourly earnings growth slowed to 0.3% from 0.4% in May, while their 3.6% annual growth rate was also below the 3.7% expected. That may be partly explained by the predominance of leisure and hospitality in net job gains, considering that the sector's high share of low-paid work.
The participation rate, which measures employment relative to the total working age population, also remained stuck at May's level of 61.6%.
""Participation for both men and women has been flat over the past year,"" said Shepherdson. ""If that doesn’t change in the fall, the risk of sustained inflation, via accelerating wage growth, will be much bigger."""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Industrial production in Brazil rose in May for the first month in four, figures showed on Friday, lifting output up to pre-pandemic levels although the pace of growth was slower than economists had expected and not particularly widespread.
Statistics agency IBGE said output rose 1.4% from the previous month, compared with the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists for a 1.7% rise. April's figure was revised to a 1.5% fall from a 1.3% decline.
These figures mean Brazilian industrial production is now back to where it was in February last year before the COVID-19 pandemic, IBGE said.
IBGE survey manager Andre Macedo said the effects of the second wave of the pandemic this year are still being felt across the sector.
""Much of this predominantly negative trend in recent months is directly linked to the resurgence of the pandemic at the beginning of 2021, which wreaked havoc on production chains,"" he said.
IBGE said 15 of the 26 sectors surveyed saw a rise in production in May, and only two of the four major categories - capital goods and consumer goods - saw output rise.
Compared to May last year, however, overall production jumped 24.0% due to base effects, the second biggest year-on-year rise on record after April's rebound, IBGE said.

January-May production was up 13.1% from a year earlier, and output in the 12 months through May was 4.9% higher than the same period a year earlier, IBGE said.
The central bank last week revised up its 2021 growth forecast for Brazilian industry to 6.6% from 6.4%. IBGE figures show, however, that the industrial sector is still 16.7% smaller than its peak in May 2011.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain posted a record drop in jobless figures for the second month in a row in June, as looser COVID-19 restrictions, increased vaccination rates and the cautious return of tourism buoyed the labour market.
The number of people registering as jobless fell by 4.4% from May, leaving 3.61 million out of work, labour ministry data showed on Friday, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline.
The social security ministry said Spain had created a net calendar-adjusted 203,000 jobs last month, thanks largely to robust growth in the services sector as the summer tourism season cranks into gear, drawing in Spanish holidaymakers and raising the size of the workforce to near pre-pandemic levels.
Still, regions dependent on foreign tourism like the Balearic and Canary Islands are lagging behind on job creation and are home to the majority of furloughed workers, Social Security Minister Jose Luis Escriva told a news conference.
However, most Spanish regions have already reached pre-pandemic employment levels, according to data from his department. 
""The numbers surprised everyone,"" he said. 
There were also 6.4% fewer jobless claims than in June 2020, when economic activity was still hamstrung by a strict lockdown to curb the first wave of coronavirus infections, the labour ministry said. 
However, the number of jobless remained significantly above the 3.02 million of June 2019 before the pandemic struck.
Friday's solid data adds to recent positive economic signals from Spain, where growth in factory activity also reached a two-decade high last month. 

After a 10.8% slump in 2020, the economy shrank a further 0.4% in the first quarter as COVID-19 restrictions slowed activity, but Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said this week that output expanded a record 18% in the second quarter from a year ago. 
A national state of emergency ended in May, and the country began letting in vaccinated visitors from anywhere in the world from June 7. The government expects foreign tourist arrivals to reach 45% of their pre-pandemic levels this summer.

Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.3% month-on-month for a 9.6% year-on-year increase.
Changes in prices at factory gates are usually transmitted to final consumers and therefore herald trends in inflation that the European Central Bank targets with its monetary policy.
Euro zone inflation eased in June to 1.9%, levelling off for the summer months before an expected move well above the ECB's target towards the autumn on higher commodity prices. 
The ECB wants to keep consumer price growth ""below but close to 2%"" over the medium term.
The rise in intermediate goods' prices remained the same in May against April, at 1.8%, with energy costs registering the third-biggest increase of 2.1%. But in year-on-year terms, energy contributed the most, with prices surging 25.1% against May 2020, while intermediate goods were up 9.2%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home rental prices rose by their fastest for at least 2-1/2 years, according to a private survey, as record numbers of college graduates flocked to big cities in search of jobs as the economy recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Average prices in 40 cities rose 2.1% in June from a month earlier, compared with May's 0.78% increase, statistics from Zhuge House Hunter, one of China's largest independent real estate research firms, showed on Thursday. It was the biggest monthly increase since Zhuge started compiling the data in January 2019. 
Rents rose fastest in top-tier cities, with the southern tech hub of Shenzhen up 2.56% compared with May's 1.3% growth. Such cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, are the top locations for young job seekers, Zhuge House Hunter said. 
Compared with a year earlier, rents in June were up 1.51%, the first gain since April 2020.
Growing numbers of college leavers has fuelled demand, and China has vowed to expand rental markets to make housing more affordable in big cities, where home prices and rents have surged in recent years.
The education ministry has estimated that more than 9 million college students would graduate this year, beating the record of 8.73 million set last year. The ministry expects graduates to exceed 10 million in 2022.
Major cities such as Beijing and Shenzhen began implementing measures this year to boost the supply of rental properties. 
Kaylee Jian, 22, a postgraduate student from southwestern Chengdu city, arrived in Beijing in June to intern at a firm while exploring job opportunities in the capital ahead of her graduation in December. 
""My rent takes up 150% of my intern salary, so I still have to spend my family's money,"" she said. 
Jian shares an apartment with one other person in the north of Beijing, and pays about 3,000 yuan ($463) a month in rent. 

""My parents told me that in Chengdu you could rent an entire well-renovated home for 2,000 yuan a month. I've finally realised how expensive it is to live in cities like our capital.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Consumer inflation in South Korea stayed above 2% in June for the third consecutive month, hovering near a nine-year peak, adding pressure on policymakers to raise interest rates sooner rather than later.
Consumer prices rose 2.4% from the same month a year prior, government data showed on Friday, slightly missing analysts' 2.5% forecast and a tad off May's 2.6% - the fastest growth since April 2012.
The breakdown of data showed the cost of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products rose 10.4% on year, while that of petroleum surged 19.9%.
""As the impact from a low base of comparison persists over the coming months, and as fresh-food prices likely rise ahead of the monsoon season and Chuseok holiday, inflation will continue to stay above 2% for some time,"" said economist Kim Yeon-jin at Eugene Investment & Securities.
""The government's planned extra budget and cash handouts will likely lift the service sector and boost demand,"" Kim said.
On Thursday, the government announced a 33 trillion won ($29.08 billion) supplementary budget that included pandemic relief for households.
Many economists now see a base interest rate hike from the current record low of 0.50% as early as the third quarter of 2021, as house prices soar and inflation remains above 2%, even as the impact of last year's low base fades.
South Korea is seen to be Asia's first economy to pull back on pandemic-era monetary stimulus and normalise easy policy.
Bank of Korea (BOK) Governor Lee Ju-yeol said last week the bank will start normalising easy monetary policy by year-end.
""A third-quarter hike is possible if the recent surge in domestic virus cases is quickly contained and the vaccination roll-out regains strong momentum, but as things stand, a move in the fourth-quarter looks more likely,"" said ANZ economist Krystal Tan.
The BOK next reviews its policy rate at its July 15 meeting.
STOPPED BUYING
Consumer prices soared an average 1.8% during the first half of the year, versus 0.6% a year earlier and approaching the BOK's 2% target.
""I saw snack bars and ready-meal stores using quail eggs instead of just eggs because they got so expensive. Zucchinis and spring onions are also so expensive I stopped buying them,"" said 26-year-old homemaker Kim Sung-eun.
""Apples have also shot up in price, but I still buy them as drinking squashed apple juice every morning is a daily routine for me and my husband,"" she said.
""Our living expenses jumped nearly 20% in the first half of this year from last.""
Rising input costs due to inflationary pressure is also straining South Korean manufacturers, with the BOK in a report this week saying 49% of 281 firms surveyed were passing higher costs to clients.
Meanwhile, the core consumer price index, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, came at 1.2%, unchanged from May when it rose at the sharpest pace since November 2018.

However, on a month-on-month basis, headline inflation was minus 0.1%, falling into negative territory for the first time in seven months, compared with positive 0.1% in May.
The BOK currently sees inflation at 1.8% for all of 2021 and 1.4% for 2022. It was 0.5% in 2020, just above the record low of 0.4% in 2019.

Consumer prices rose 2.4% from a year earlier, slowing from a 2.6% pace in May, data from the statistics office showed Friday. Economists had expected the pace would decelerate only to 2.5%.
The slowdown adds support to the Bank of Korea’s argument that recent price data have been boosted by comparison with last year’s dismal figures and some inflationary pressures are likely to fade going forward. The central bank sees inflation fluctuating around its 2% target for the rest of the year before sliding lower in 2022.
Inflation may get a boost from a 33 trillion won extra budget proposed by the government this week to provide cash handouts to 80% of South Korean households. If the stimulus package passes, it would be among the largest since the pandemic hit last year.
Vaccinations have also been accelerating even though they have yet to reach the majority of the population. The latest threat to consumer activity has been the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which prompted authorities to delay plans to ease social distancing rules in Seoul from this week.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 01:26PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market recovery gaining steam; worker shortages an obstacle,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, while layoffs plunged to a 21-year low in June, suggesting the labor market recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was gaining traction.
But a shortage of willing workers is hampering hiring, with other data on Thursday showing a measure of employment at factories contracting in June for the first time in seven months. Manufacturers said they were experiencing ""difficulty in hiring and retaining direct labor,"" the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said in its survey of national factory activity, noting that these challenges ""across the entire value chain continue to be the major obstacles to increasing growth."" 
One respondent in primary metals said ""lack of labor is killing us.""
The data was released ahead of Friday's closely watched employment report for June, which according to a Reuters survey of economists will likely show nonfarm payrolls increasing by 700,000 jobs last month after rising by 559,000 in May. The unemployment rate is forecast to tick down to 5.7% from 5.8%. 
The economy is experiencing a boom in demand following a reopening made possible by vaccinations against the coronavirus, with more than 150 million Americans fully immunized. 
""America's back to work and an important milestone was reached where new claims are back below the 400,000 barrier after a hiccup at the start of June,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Summer is always the strongest season for hiring each year, and this year is no exception.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 51,000 to a seasonally adjusted 364,000 for the week ended June 26, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest number since March 2020, when mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
The improvement in claims had appeared to stall in mid-June. Though claims remain above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market, they have tumbled from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 390,000 applications for the latest week. There was a big decline in filings in Pennsylvania, which reversed the prior week's surge. The state last month upgraded its filing system, and the transition could be causing volatility in the data. There were also large drops in claims in California, Kentucky and Texas. 
Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkplrlazpb/jobless-claims.png 
The claims data could become noisy in the weeks ahead as 25 states with mostly Republican governors pull out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly check, which businesses complained were encouraging the jobless to stay at home. The early termination began on June 5 and will run through July 31, when Louisiana, the only one of those states with a Democratic governor, ends the weekly check.
For the rest of the country, these benefits will lapse on Sept. 6. There is no evidence so far of a surge in job searches in the 20 states that have already ended the federal benefits.
A survey this week by job search engine Indeed https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/06/29/indeed-job-seeker-survey-june-2021 found that while the vast majority of the unemployed indicated they would like to start looking for work in the next three months, many did not express a sense of urgency. But rising vaccinations, dwindling savings and the opening of schools in the fall will be key to pulling them back into the labor force.
The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid rose 56,000 to 3.469 million during the week ended June 19. There were 14.7 million people receiving benefits under all programs in mid-June, slightly down from 14.8 million early in the month.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly higher. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
EMPLOYEE POACHING
In a separate report on Thursday, ISM said its index of national factory activity slipped to 60.6 last month from 61.2 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. 
A measure of factory employment contracted for the first time since November. Companies reported hiring or attempting to hire. A significant number reported ""employee turnover due to wage dynamics in the markets,"" ISM's Timothy Fiore said. 
Graphic: ISM PMI - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/nmopaxqdrva/ismpmi.png 
""It appears that companies are paying up to steal workers from other firms,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Lack of affordable child care and fears of contracting the coronavirus have also been blamed for keeping workers, mostly women, at home. There were a record 9.3 million job openings at the end of April and 9.3 million people were officially unemployed in May.
A third report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers tumbled 16.7% to 20,476 in June, the lowest level since June 2000. Layoffs plummeted 88% compared to June 2020.

There were 67,975 job cuts in the second quarter, the fewest since the April-June period in 1997. In the first half of this year, layoffs dropped 87% to 212,661, the lowest total for the January-June period since 1995.
""We're seeing the rubber band snap back,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""Companies are holding on tight to their workers during a time of record job openings and very high job seeker confidence. We haven't seen job cuts this low since the Dot-Com boom.""

93,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2021 11:56AM ET</span>","Colombia's consumer prices could have fallen slightly in June, analysts say","By Nelson Bocanegra
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Consumer prices in Colombia could have fallen 0.08% in June, mostly due to food supplies returning to normal following a long-running wave of protests and blockades, a Reuters poll revealed on Thursday. 
Estimates from 14 analysts fluctuated between a fall in prices of 0.28% and an increase of 0.21%. 
If the poll's median estimate is achieved, it will contrast with Colombia's 1% increase in inflation in May, when consumer prices were affected by national protests which saw highways blocked across the country, affecting centers of production and international trade.
""Our estimate takes into account the recovery in domestic supply, which would lead to a correction in prices,"" bank Bancolombia (NYSE:CIB) said in a statement. 
""This could be partially offset by the effect of the exchange rate on some imported foods and the evolution of international prices for goods such as corn and soybeans,"" it added.
The government's DANE statistics agency is expected to publish the monthly inflation figures on July 3.
If the median forecast is reached, inflation for the last 12 months will reach 3.61%, higher than the 3.35% as of May, and above the central bank's long-term target of 3%. 
Furthermore, estimates for annual inflation in 2021 have risen to 3.72%, up from 3.30% in last month's poll. 

In a similar vein, analysts now forecast inflation to close 2022 at 3.10%, up from estimates of 3% in the previous survey. 
Low inflation has been one of the central bank's chief reasons for keeping its benchmark interest rate stable at a historic low of 1.75% over the last nine months as it seeks to support economic recovery.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 48.8 in June from 47.6 in May, the highest reading since February 2020 but still below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
The index has been clawing its way higher gradually after plummeting to 35.0 in April 2020, by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-year history.
""Firms continued to signal lower sales, falling production and job shedding, but tentative signs of a recovery in demand curbed the respective rates of contraction,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
Most of the PMI's sub-indexes remained below the 50.0 mark, despite rising from May, though input prices and business expectations increased above that threshold.
Business confidence improved for a third straight month to its highest level since the start of 2020 on the back of ""hopes of greater vaccine and raw material availability,"" said De Lima. ""Firms also foresee an economic recovery and a pick-up in demand in the year ahead.""

Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in mid-June forecast that by the third quarter the Mexican economy will reach pre-pandemic levels, after gross domestic product contracted by some 8.5% last year driven by pandemic-related fallout.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Job growth in Brazil accelerated sharply in May, official figures showed on Thursday, with formal jobs created almost double the consensus estimate to lift the total number of new positions opened this year above 1 million.
That marks the strongest pace of job growth since 2010, both for the month of May and the first five months of the year, according to the Economy Ministry. 
""The Brazilian economy is rising, and most importantly, sectors that were hit really hard before, like services, are now leading the way,"" Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said in an online address after the figures were released.
""This confirms that the recovery is broad-based, all sectors are creating new jobs, the pace is very strong, and we hope that measures we are taking will accelerate this process even further,"" he said.
Some 1.55 million positions were created in May and 1.27 million were cut, resulting in 280,666 net new positions. That was well up from the previous month and almost double the median forecast of 150,000 new jobs in a Reuters poll of economists.
The gains were led by the services sector, which created a net 110,956 new positions. Commerce accounted for 60,480 net new positions, industry 44,146 and agriculture 42,526, the ministry said.
This means Brazil created a net 1.23 million new formal jobs in the first five months of the year. These figures do not include the nearly 40 million undocumented workers in Brazil who do not have formal employment registration.
The total number of formally registered workers in Brazil rose to 40.6 million in May, the highest May reading since 2015, according to ministry figures.

Earnings fell, however, with the average monthly salary of new jobs created in May down 4.1% in real terms from the prior month to an unadjusted 1,797.10 reais ($363).

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that construction spending dropped 0.3% after edging up 0.1% in April. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.4%. Construction spending, which accounts for about 3.6% of gross domestic product, increased 7.5% on a year-on-year basis in May.
Spending on private construction projects fell 0.3%, weighed down by a 1.1% drop in private nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling. Business investment on nonresidential structures has declined for sixth straight quarters. Private construction outlays increased 0.3% in April. 
Investment in residential projects rose 0.2%, lifted by a 0.8% increase in single-family homebuilding. 
Demand for housing remains robust, but expensive building materials, especially framing lumber, are constraining builders' ability to ramp up construction.
The government reported last month that homebuilding rose moderately in May, while permits for future home construction fell to a seven-month low. Housing completions also declined while the number of homes authorized for construction but not yet started rose to the highest level since 1999.

Outlays on residential projects advanced 0.7% in April. 
Spending on public construction projects fell 0.2% in May after decreasing 0.6% in April.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a moderate pace in June, but employment contracted for the first time in seven months, likely because of rampant shortages of raw materials and labor. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity slipped to 60.6 last month, the lowest reading since January, from 61.2 in May.
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to 61.0 in June.
Massive fiscal stimulus boosted demand for long-lasting manufactured goods during the COVID-19 pandemic, with millions of Americans working from home and learning remotely. Factories are struggling to keep up as the pandemic fractured supply chains and disrupted the global shipping industry. 
A global shortage of semiconductors is undercutting production of motor vehicles, electronics and household appliances. The scarcity of raw materials is driving up costs for both manufacturers and consumers, contributing to an acceleration in inflation in recent months.
Though higher inflation is generally viewed as transitory, Americans should expect to pay more for goods and services until the demand-supply imbalance eases. Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) believe supply will start catching up later this year, but caution it could take until at least mid-2022 to fully restore motor vehicle inventories.
The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to a record 92.1 last month from a reading of 88.0 in May. Consumer prices have been surging, with the Federal Reserve's main annual inflation measure rising by the most in 29 years in May. 
Demand is also being fueled by the reopening of the economy, with more than 150 million Americans fully vaccinated.
The survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index edged down to a reading of 66.0 last month from 67.0 in May. Inventories at factories remain low and business warehouses are almost empty. A pickup in production allowed factories to work through some of the backlog of uncompleted work.
A measure of factory employment contracted for the first time since November. 
Labor is scarce even as 9.3 million people are officially unemployed. Generous unemployment benefits funded by the government, problems with child care and fears of contracting the virus have been blamed for keeping workers home.

There have also been pandemic-related retirements as well as transitions to new careers. The slowdown in hiring at factories last month was highlighted in the June ADP National Employment Report published on Wednesday.
The government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 700,000 jobs in June after rising 559,000 in May, according to a Reuters survey of economists.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Growth in Brazil's manufacturing sector accelerated in June to its fastest rate in four months, a survey of purchasing managers' activity showed on Thursday, led by the strongest growth this year in employment and export orders.
The average pace of growth in the second quarter, however, was slower than the prior three-month period, a consequence of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But Brazilian businesses banked on an end to the current difficulties and a brighter second half of the year, IHS Markit's purchasing managers index (PMI) report showed.
The headline PMI rose to 56.4 in June from 53.7 in May, IHS Markit said, the highest since February. A reading above 50.0 marks expansion, while a reading below signifies contraction. The series was launched in 2006.
""Despite the ongoing battle against another wave of COVID-19 cases, companies saw their order books expand substantially from last month ... (and) factories worked on rebuilding their stocks to fulfill rising demand,"" said Polyanna de Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
""The resilience of the manufacturing industry fed through to the labor market as companies were confident in the rebound and took on additional workers. Employment increased at the quickest pace in seven months as business optimism improved,"" she said.

The economy's resilience to the pandemic has prompted upward revisions to this year's growth outlook, and the latest median forecast in a weekly central bank survey of economists is 5.1%. 
The employment index rose to the highest since November, and the new export orders index rose to the highest since December, IHS Markit said.

Initial claims in regular state programs decreased by 51,000 to 364,000 in the week ended June 26, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 388,000 initial applications.
Continuing claims for ongoing state benefits increased to 3.47 million the week ended June 19.
The drop in applications is consistent with improving business conditions and companies’ efforts to increase headcounts to meet demand as the economy reopens. Still, initial claims remain above pre-pandemic levels and many employers say they are having trouble finding qualified workers, which is likely holding back the pace of the recovery.

Early estimates published by the Office for National Statistics had shown 1.7 million people were furloughed in late May.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -European factories continued to ramp up their post-lockdown recovery in June but Asian manufacturers saw momentum weaken amid rising input costs and the reintroduction of curbs to combat a new wave of coronavirus infections, surveys showed.
Euro zone manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace on record last month while Britain's factories extended their post-lockdown recovery and went on a hiring spree.
""How has that story turned -- a few months ago we were seeing the euro zone was lagging with vaccinations far behind. We were expecting a turnaround and we haven't seen much disappointment,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""That upside scenario has materialised. There is a very broad feeling amongst businesses in both services and industry that the coming months are going to be very strong as economies reopen.""
Czech and Polish manufacturing hit a record pace of activity for the second month in a row as orders rose and economies opened up again.
But manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in China and Japan as raw materials rose, while activity shrank in Vietnam, Malaysia and India, where governments imposed tougher restrictions to contain fresh coronavirus outbreaks.
A shortage of shipping containers and supply chains hugely affected by the global pandemic have made it a sellers' market for materials needed by factories. An index measuring input prices in the euro zone was at its highest since the survey began 24 years ago.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) nevertheless rose to a survey high of 63.4 in June from May's 63.1, above an initial 63.1 ""flash"" estimate. Anything above 50 indicates growth. [EUR/PMIM]
Britain's PMI dipped to 63.9 from May's all-time high but the pace of expansion in output, new orders and employment remained among the highest in the survey's near 30-year history after some COVID-19 restrictions were eased. [GB/PMIM]
ASIA LAG
Data showed Asia was lagging behind western economies in recovering from the pandemic doldrums, reinforcing the view that many regional central banks were unlikely to withdraw pandemic-era stimulus soon.
""The June PMIs dropped back as virus outbreaks and supply chain issues created mounting headwinds for industry,"" said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
""With neither issue likely to be resolved soon, the rapid growth in industry over the past few quarters looks unlikely to be repeated.""
China's factory activity expanded at a softer pace in June with output growth slumping to the lowest level in 15 months, according to a private survey, in line with an official survey showing a dip in activity to a fourth-month low.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI fell to 51.3 in June from May's 52, marking the 14th month of expansion but coming in below analyst expectations for only a slight slowdown to 51.8.
Higher raw materials costs and a shortage of semiconductor chips also hurt export powerhouses including Japan, which saw factory activity expand at the slowest pace in four months in June.
South Korea fared better, with factory activity growing for a ninth consecutive month in June, though record input and output price rises pointed to strains on manufacturers.
""Manufacturers were increasingly commenting that severe supply chain disruption was starting to impact activity,"" said Usamah Bhatti, an economist at IHS Markit.
Once seen as a driver of global growth, Asian's emerging economies are lagging advanced economies in recovering from the pandemic's pain as delays in vaccine rollouts hurt domestic demand and countries reliant on tourism.

Vietnam's PMI plunged to 44.1, marking the sharpest deterioration in business conditions while Malaysia's PMI fell to 39.9 as renewed COVID curbs weighed on external and domestic demand. The PMI for Taiwan fell to 57.6 from 62.0.
India's factory activity contracted for the first time in almost a year as restrictions to contain the deadly second wave of the coronavirus hit demand.

The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments to shutter much of the 19-country bloc's dominant services industry, ravaging the economy, but factories have largely remained open and the lifting of some restrictions has boosted demand.
IHS Markit's final manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 63.4 in June from May's 63.1, above an initial 63.1 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday and seen as a good guide to economic health, rose from May's 62.2 to 62.6. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""Euro zone manufacturing continued to grow at a rate unbeaten in almost 24 years of survey history in June as demand surged with the further relaxation of COVID-19 containment measures,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""However, the sheer speed of the recent upsurge in demand has led to a sellers' market as capacity and transportation constraints limit the availability of inputs to factories, which have in turn driven industrial prices higher at a rate not previously witnessed by the survey.""
Due to a shortage of shipping containers and supply chains hugely affected by the global pandemic, the input prices index soared to 88.5 from 87.1 -- by far the highest in the survey's history. Inflation dipped to 1.9% last month, official flash data showed on Wednesday.

After a slow start, vaccine programmes are accelerating in the bloc so optimism improved and to meet strong demand, factories increased headcount at the fastest rate since the survey began.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 63.9 from an all-time high of 65.6 in May. It was also down a touch from a preliminary ""flash"" reading for June of 64.2.
The pace of expansion in output, new orders and employment remained among the highest of the survey's near 30-year history after COVID-19 restrictions in Britain and beyond were eased.
But the combination of surging demand and lingering social-distancing requirements caused delays in supply chains and fanned inflationary pressures, IHS Markit said.
Average input costs rose at the fastest pace on record with prices rising for chemicals, electronics, energy, food products, metals, plastics and timber.
As a result, selling prices rose by the most since those figures were first collected in November 1999.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing rose to 60.4 last month from 59.4 in May, which was already the highest level since April 1998. Figures above the 50.0 mark indicate expansions in activity.
""Order books were swelled by improved demand from across a spectrum of sources, with hospitality reportedly a key driver of growth as the economy reopens further in line with easing COVID restrictions,"" said Paul Smith, an economist at IHS Markit.
The strong growth is coming alongside challenges with supply chains, creating pressure on wholesale prices.

While Spain's economy shrank 0.5% in the first quarter as COVID-19 restrictions hurt businesses, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said earlier this week that the country's output expanded a record 18% in the second quarter from a year ago.
The government expects the economy to grow 6.5% this year after 2020's record 10.8% contraction.

Although many Indian states have recently relaxed some containment measures following a decrease in daily cases the rapid emergence of the new Delta Plus variant has raised concerns over the nation's already weak economic outlook.
The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index, compiled by IHS Markit, declined to an 11-month low of 48.1 in June from May's 50.8, moving below the 50-level separating growth from contraction.
""The intensification of the COVID-19 crisis in India had a detrimental impact on the manufacturing economy,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit.
""Out of the three broad areas of the manufacturing sector monitored by the survey, capital goods was the worst-affected area in June. Output here declined at a steep rate due to a sharp fall in sales.""
As overall demand and output shrank in June for the first time in 11 months, manufacturing firms extended their record job cutting spree, albeit at a slower pace.
The survey, conducted before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's announcement of additional fiscal support on Monday, also showed optimism about the year ahead declined to its lowest since July 2020.
""Companies became increasingly worried about when the pandemic will end, which resulted in downward revisions to output growth projections. As a result of subdued optimism, jobs were shed again in June,"" De Lima said.
Despite a sustained rise in input costs, firms increased output prices at a slower rate last month to attract demand.

However that may not be enough to significantly soften a surge in overall inflation, which hit a six-month high in May. A jump in input costs due to a strong increase in energy and commodity prices pushed wholesale price inflation to its strongest in at least 15 years.
Still, the Reserve Bank of India, which in April cut its growth forecast for this fiscal year to 9.5% from 10.5%, was not expected to hike its key interest rates anytime soon as the primary focus remains on boosting economic growth. [ECILT/IN]

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean exports marked a fourth consecutive month of double-digit growth in June, albeit at a reduced pace, propelled by solid economic recovery in major markets globally and continued strong demand for memory chips and automobiles.
Exports surged 39.7% in June versus the same month a year earlier, reaching the third-biggest value on record at $54.80 billion, trade ministry data showed on Thursday. That beat the 33.6% average of 17 economist estimates in a Reuters poll, and marked the eighth consecutive month of expansion.
Exports grew 45.6% in May, the sharpest increase since August 1988.
""As base effect (from the coronavirus) fades, the growth rate itself probably reached the peak in May ... but the exports value will likely continue growing in the third quarter,"" said Park Sang-hyun, chief economist at Hi Investment & Securities.
""We expected weakened Chinese demand due to shipping delays and supply-chain disruptions but the impact is seen limited, with exports to other ASEAN economies improving.""
The nation's monthly trade data is a closely watched as it is the first to be released among major exporting economies and so widely considered a bellwether for global trade.
Overseas sales of semiconductors, the country's top export, grew for the 12th month in a row, by 34.4%, while those of cars and petrochemical products surged 62.5% and 68.5% respectively.
By destination, exports to China, the United States and the European Union soared 14.3% and 51.9% and 65.3%, while those to South Korea's six other major trading partners also increased.
Fresh risks to exports are the spread of the coronavirus Delta variant and worries about slowing Chinese economic recovery, economists said.
""Exports to China may fall to single-digit growth as China's June manufacturing PMI (purchasing managers index) signalled weakening recovery momentum... Delta virus and related lockdown measures are also a potential risk to exports,"" Park said.
Data on Wednesday showed growth in Chinese factory activity slowed in June to a four-month low on higher raw material costs, a shortage of semiconductors and a COVID-19 outbreak in major export province Guangdong, amid wider supply chain disruption in Asia.

Meanwhile, South Korean trade data on Thursday also showed imports grew 40.7% in June, beating forecasts for a 33.0% jump. The trade surplus stood at $4.44 billion, versus $2.94 billion a month prior.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese big manufacturers' business confidence improved in the second quarter to hit a two-and-half-year high, a central bank survey showed, a sign solid global demand was helping the economy emerge from the coronavirus pandemic-induced doldrums.
Service-sector sentiment also turned positive for the first time in five quarters, the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) ""Tankan"" survey showed, indicating that the economic recovery was broadening even as Japan struggles to contain a fresh wave of coronavirus infections.
Companies expect to increase capital expenditure in the year that began in April as profit recovers from last year's slump, offering hope among policymakers who project growth to accelerate in the latter half of this year.
""The further rebound in the Q2 Tankan supports our view that the economy's disappointing start to the year won't prevent vaccines driving a strong rebound in the second half of the year,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment jumped to plus 14 in June from plus 5 in March, improving for the fourth consecutive quarter and hitting the highest level since December 2018, the survey showed on Thursday.
Non-manufacturers' mood also improved to plus 1 from minus 1 in the previous survey, to reach its highest index reading since March 2020, as goods distribution and leisure industries saw activity gradually resume after disruption caused by COVID-19.
""Exports and output continue to improve, which is helping sentiment improve for most manufacturing sectors. The auto sector, however, saw sentiment worsen due to shortages in semiconductor chips,"" a BOJ official said at a briefing.
Big companies expect capital expenditure to rise 9.6% in the current fiscal year ending in March, after a 8.3% drop in the previous year, the survey showed.
Some analysts, however, have questioned how quickly the economy can sustainably emerge from the pandemic with a resurgence in infections and slow a vaccination programme clouding the outlook for consumption.
Soaring raw material costs and chip shortages were also fanning caution among some manufacturers, such as those of lumber goods and automobiles, the survey showed.
""Industries such as restaurants and hotels showed signs of improvement probably because people are getting used to the coronavirus, though department stores appear to feel more of a pain from COVID curbs,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities.
""The pace of recovery will largely depend on developments of the coronavirus and vaccine rollout from now on,"" he said.
Japan's economy shrank an annualised 3.9% in the first quarter and likely grew only modestly in the April-June period as state-of-emergency curbs to prevent the spread of COVID-19 cooled consumption.
While the curbs have been lifted for most areas, many analysts expect consumption to remain a weak spot in Japan's export-driven recovery as slow vaccinations keep households from boosting spending on leisure and dining out.

The Tankan will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise at its interest rate review on July 15-16, when it will produce fresh quarterly growth and inflation projections.
Tankan sentiment index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.3 last month from May's 52, marking the 14th month of expansion, but it came below analyst expectations for a only slight slowdown to 51.8. 
The softer results in the private survey, mostly covering export-oriented and small manufacturers, are in line with those in an official survey, which showed factory growth dipped to a four-month low due to the drag from production.
A sub-index for output dropped to 51.0 in June, the lowest since March 2020, when the industrial sector started to rebound from COVID-induced paralysis. The growth in new orders also eased to a three-month low. 
New export orders barely grew, compared with a robust expansion the previous month as rising COVID-19 cases across the world, especially of the more infectious Delta variant, took a toll on demand. 
More than 150 novel coronavirus cases have been reported in Guangdong province, a manufacturing and exporting hub in southern China, since the latest wave of cases struck in late May, prompting local governments to step up prevention and control efforts that have curbed port processing capacity.
However, there are some bright spots in the private survey, which showed firms added to their payrolls at the fastest pace in seven months, as they ramped up efforts to increase capacity in the months ahead amid improved customers demand.
Inflationary pressures eased a bit, with input prices rising at slowest pace since November last year. 

""The manufacturing sector has gradually returned to normal,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group. 
""In the second half of this year, the low base effect from last year will weaken. Inflationary pressure, coupled with the economic slowdown, is still a serious challenge for China.""

(Reuters) -Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes rose by the most in 11 months in May driven by a decline in mortgage rates as well as an uptick in listings.
The increase could signal some imminent relief from the shortage of homes for sale that has weighed on sales and driven residential property prices to record highs.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, rose 8.0% to 114.7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales would decline 0.8% percent.
Pending home contracts are seen as a forward-looking indicator of the health of the housing market because they become sales one to two months later.
""May's strong increase in transactions – following April’s decline, as well as a sudden erosion in home affordability – was indeed a surprise,"" Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist, said in a statement. 
Compared with one year ago, pending sales were up 13.1%.
New and existing home sales have fallen sharply this year because of a shortage of houses on the market, and the limited supply has resulted in skyrocketing home prices.
But Yun said listings were up recently - with the inventory of existing homes climbing to 2.5 months' supply at recent sales rates, the highest since last October, according to NAR data.
He also pointed to an easing in borrowing costs as a factor helping to lift the volume of contract signings. 

After hitting record lows below 3% late last year, the interest rate on 30-year fixed rate mortgages climbed sharply in the first quarter, but then fell back somewhat in May. The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages was 3.20% last week, according to the Mortgage Bankers' Association.. 
""Home price growth will steadily moderate with increased supply, but a broad and prolonged decline in prices is unlikely,"" Yun said. ""However, if a reduction occurs in some markets, homebuyers will view the lower home price as a second-chance opportunity to get into the market after being outbid in previous multiple-bid market conditions.""

112,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 12:47PM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls increase solidly; pending home sales rebound,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased more than expected in June as companies rushed to boost production and services amid a rapidly reopening economy, though a shortage of willing workers continues to hang over the labor market recovery.
The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed hiring in the leisure and hospitality sector accounting for nearly half of the increase in private payrolls this month. Manufacturing payrolls growth slowed, likely reflecting labor shortages as well as scarce raw materials. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering production of motor vehicles and some household appliances.
""The labor market is continuing to heal,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""Job growth is expected to pick up on a broader reopening, but timing is uncertain given it is unclear how quickly supply constraints will ease.""
Private payrolls increased by 692,000 jobs in June. Data for May was revised lower to show 886,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 978,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 600,000 jobs. 
More than 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing authorities to remove pandemic-related restrictions on businesses and mask mandates for the inoculated. 
Employment gains in June were evenly spread among small, medium and large companies, indicating that the economy's recovery from the pandemic was broadening in scope.
Leisure and hospitality payrolls increased by 332,000 jobs and there were solid gains in education and health services. Factories added only 19,000 jobs, below the monthly average 43,000 jobs in the past three months. 
Hiring at construction sites increased by 47,000 jobs. The sector is being underpinned by strong demand for housing, thanks to historically low mortgage rates and a shift to home offices during the pandemic. 
A separate report from the National Association of Realtors on Wednesday showed contracts to buy previously owned homes rebounded 8% in May. But the housing market is grappling with a severe shortages of homes for sale, which is driving up prices well beyond the reach of some first-time buyers.
Applications for loans to buy a home fell last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said in another report. Home purchase loans were down 17.3% compared to same period last year.
""We expect record high home prices and scarce inventories of existing homes for sale will continue to weigh on home sales,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
LABOR CRUNCH
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive and closely watched employment report for June on Friday. But it has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics because of methodology differences.
The ADP report has in recent months overestimated the private payroll gains reflected in the BLS data after understating that growth through much of the jobs recovery, which started in May 2020.
""It remains difficult to use the ADP data to accurately predict the BLS data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 600,000 jobs in June after rising 492,000 in May. With government hiring expected to have increased by about 100,000, that would lead to overall payrolls advancing by 700,000 jobs in June. 
The economy created 559,000 jobs in May. A shortage of willing workers is frustrating efforts to ramp up hiring. There were a record 9.3 million job openings as of April.
The precise cause of the labor crunch is a matter of fierce - often political - debate. Economists generally point to several factors, among them the unusually generous unemployment benefits, including a weekly $300 subsidy from the federal government, that were part of the Biden administration's pandemic relief package. 
A lack of child care facilities as some centers which shut during the pandemic never reopened, is also keeping some parents home, and there is also indication that some workers remain worried about the health risks of returning to work.
At least 26 states mostly led by Republican governors are terminating federal government-funded unemployment benefits before the Sept. 6 expiration date. No evidence has emerged so far that the early terminations, which started on June 12 and will run through July 31, are pulling the unemployed into jobs, although the rolls of those receiving benefits is shrinking faster in those states.
A survey by job search engine Indeed https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/06/29/indeed-job-seeker-survey-june-2021 found that while the vast majority of unemployed indicated they would like to start looking for work in the next three months, many did not express a sense of urgency. It showed rising vaccinations, shrinking savings and the opening of schools in the fall will be key catalysts.

About 9.3 million people are officially classified as unemployed. Job growth could, however, surprise on the upside this month. The Conference Board's survey of consumers showed households extremely upbeat in their views of the labor market.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, surged in June to the highest level since 2000.

113,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 11:36AM ET</span>",India's Jan-March current account deficit widens as imports normalise,"By Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's current account deficit widened in the January-March quarter on the back of a higher trade deficit and lower net invisible receipts, the Reserve Bank of India said in a release on Wednesday.
The current account deficit stood at $8.1 billion in the January-March quarter compared to a surplus of $0.6 billion in the same quarter last year.
The deficit stood at 1% of gross domestic product in the latest quarter, RBI data showed.
""A normalisation in import demand as well as a surge in gold imports contributed to the widening of the current account deficit,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at the rating agency ICRA.
Data earlier in June showed India's deficit in goods trade had widened to $6.28 billion in May from $3.15 billion in May 2020.
RBI said net external commercial borrowing had fallen to $6.1 billion in the January-March quarter compared with $9.4 billion a year earlier, but portfolio investments, mainly in the form of equity purchases, increased by $7.3 billion versus a decline of $13.7 billion.
Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Financial Holdings, said the current account data was revealing.
""India needs to focus on improving the competitiveness of its exports to make its external balance position more sustainable,"" she said. 
Boosting exports would also help to offset weakness in domestic demand stemming from the slowness of economic recovery from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, she added.
A second wave of coronavirus infections is seen delaying economic recovery, while a rise in crude oil prices is also likely to hurt the economy. India imports over two-thirds of its oil.
For the full year 2020/21, which ended on March 31, India recorded a current account surplus of 0.9% of GDP, as against a deficit of 0.9% of GDP in 2019/20, on account of a sharp contraction in the trade deficit.
India moved to a current account surplus for the first time in over a decade in January-March 2020, and touched a record $19.2 billion in the April-June quarter.
During that period, the trade deficit narrowed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a related drop in domestic economic activity.
The balance of payments showed a surplus of $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter of the financial year 2020/21, compared with a surplus of $18.8 billion the previous year.
Net foreign direct investment inflows increased marginally to $44 billion in 2020/21 but in the January-March quarter they stood at just $2.7 billion, well down from $12 billion a year earlier. 

Nitsure said the decline in net FDI did not bode well and that India needed to become more attractive as a destination for long-term investments.
""With the widening state-level restrictions shrinking the domestic demand for fuels and gold in May 2021, we expect the current account to revert to a small, transient surplus in the ongoing quarter,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist rating agency ICRA.

(Reuters) - U.S. applications for home mortgages decreased by the most in almost five months driven by sharp declines in refinancing activity and purchase applications.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index fell 6.9% in the week ending June 25 from a week earlier, the largest drop since early February. This reflected an 8.2% decrease in applications for refinancing existing loans and a 4.8% drop in applications to purchase a home.
The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year mortgages increased to 3.20% last week from 3.18% the prior week.

""Purchase applications for conventional loans declined last week to the lowest level since last May,"" Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s Senior Vice President and Chief Economist, said in a statement. ""The average loan size for total purchase applications increased, indicating that first-time homebuyers, who typically get smaller loans, are likely getting squeezed out of the market due to the lack of entry-level homes for sale.""
Both new and existing home sales have fallen sharply this year due to a shortage of houses on the market.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's unemployment rate held steady at a historic high of 14.7% in the three months through April, figures showed on Wednesday, with the rate of deterioration in the labor market continuing to slow gradually from a year ago. 
Although the unemployment rate was unchanged from the quarter ending in March, statistics agency IBGE's comparisons with the three months through January indicated a softer market amid the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Rodolfo Margato, an economist at brokerage XP (NASDAQ:XP), said the labor market will continue to improve in the months ahead due to ""increased mobility, rising business confidence and more favorable growth prospects for the labor intensive service sector.""
That said, the labor force will only get back to ""normal levels"" in the second quarter of next year with the unemployment rate not falling below pre-pandemic levels until the second half of next year, he said.
The 14.7% unemployment rate is the highest since IBGE's series began in 2012, and as has consistently been the case for almost a year now, less than 50% of the working population have a job, the figures showed. 
Graphic: Brazil unemployment - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzzdjdvw/PARO.png 
Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) calculated that the unemployment rate would have been over 20% had the rate of participation in the job market been the same as it was a year ago.
IBGE said that the number of people officially unemployed was 14.8 million, up 489,000 from the three months through January. There are now 3.3 million fewer Brazilians in work than before the pandemic struck over a year ago, IBGE said.
Some 85.9 million Brazilians had work in April, IBGE said, little changed from the previous quarter but down 3.7%, or 3.3 million people, from the same period a year earlier.

The number of people entirely out of the workforce held steady at 76.4 million, IBGE said, but that was up more than 5.5 million people, or 7.7%, from a year earlier.
The under-employment rate rose to 29.7% from 29.0% in the November-January period, IBGE said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's public finances improved across the board in May, official figures showed on Wednesday, as the budget deficit shrank to a year low and government debt fell to its lowest as a share of the overall economy in almost a year.
Government debt fell to 84.5% of gross domestic product in May, central bank figures showed, the lowest since July 2020 and down from 85.6% the month before. 
Graphic: Brazil debt - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdvxlnjdvx/DEBTGDP.png 
Net public-sector debt also fell in May, to 59.7% of GDP from 59.8% the month before, the lowest since August.
Stronger-than-expected tax revenues in recent months have helped brighten the outlook for Brazil's public finances, so much so that Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said last month that the overall budget deficit could swing to surplus in 2023.
Guedes said last week that Brazil's debt-to-GDP ratio should close this year at 84%.
The central bank's figures on Wednesday showed that the public sector registered a deficit in May excluding interest payments of 15.5 billion reais ($3.1 billion), less than the 23.7 billion reais deficit forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The nominal deficit in the month including interest payments was 37.4 billion reais, the central bank said.
The accumulated primary deficit in the 12 months through May was 428.6 billion reais, or 5.4% of GDP, the smallest deficit since May 2020 and below a downwardly revised 7% of GDP in the year through April, the central bank said.

The nominal deficit including interest payments in the year through May was 724.3 billion reais, or 9.1% of GDP, the central bank said, compared with 827.2 billion reais, or 10.6%, of GDP the month before.

117,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 05:13AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation eases before expected march higher,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation eased this month, levelling off for the summer months before an expected move well above the European Central Bank's target towards the autumn on higher commodity prices. 
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro slipped to 1.9% in June from 2.0% in May, in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll and right on the ECB's target of ""below but close to 2%"".
Consumer price growth has accelerated this year but mostly on one-off factors, such as rebounding oil prices, a German tax hike and the statistical impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
These factors will continue to push inflation higher and price growth is likely to peak above 2.5% towards the end of the year, according to the ECB's projections.
That is creating a communications challenge for the bank, which has persistently undershot its target since 2003 and not faced rapid price growth in a decade.
However, the ECB has made it clear that this is not the sort of inflation that requires a policy response, so no tightening is on the cards and borrowing costs are set to stay ultra-low for years to come.
Policymakers argue that higher commodity prices mask weak underlying trends and inflation for services and durable goods, more meaningful measures for central bankers, remain weak.
Indeed, core inflation, or prices excluding volatile food and energy costs, held steady in June as expected at 0.9% while a more narrow measure excluding alcohol and tobacco slipped to 0.9% from 1.0%.

Wage growth, a key condition of durable inflation, is also anaemic while ECB policy is usually ineffective against short-term price movements, providing yet another reason for the bank to look past this year's surge.
The ECB sees inflation well below its target both next year and 2023 and so far no policymaker has argued that this current period of relatively high inflation could translate into the sort of durable price pressure that would risk an overshoot beyond a temporary peak.

The better-than-expected job market data increases the chances of a consumer-driven recovery over the summer months, with households ready to splash out after months of limited possibilities to spend due to COVID-19 restrictions.
The Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 38,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.691 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 20,000.
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate stood at 5.9%.

In a further positive sign, the number of employees put on reduced working hours in job protection schemes, also known as Kurzarbeit, fell sharply in June, preliminary figures showed.
""Companies are scaling back short-time work and are looking for new staff again,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said, adding that both unemployment and underemployment continued to fall sharply.

119,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2021 03:21AM ET</span>",Locked-down UK households ramped up savings in early 2021,"By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -British households increased their savings sharply in early 2021 as a return to lockdowns prevented them from visiting bars, restaurants and many shops, potentially boosting their spending power for the economic recovery now under way.
The country's savings rate, which measures the income households save as a proportion of disposable income, rose to 19.9% from 16.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday.
That was the second-highest savings rate on record after a leap to 25.9% in April-June last year during the first round of coronavirus lockdowns.
Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics, said the stock of excess savings was bigger than he had expected. 
""This represents a larger upside risk to the pace and duration of the economic recovery further ahead should households choose to spend it,"" he said.
The data also showed Britain's economy shrank a bit more than previously thought in the first quarter as gross domestic product contracted by 1.6%. The ONS had previously estimated GDP shrank by 1.5%.
Household spending was weaker than first estimated.
However, the hit to GDP in early 2021 was just a fraction of the roughly 20% slump in the second quarter of 2020 when Britain was in its first lockdown. Many businesses have adapted to the rules by, for example, ramping up their online operations. 
Britain has suffered one of the world's biggest coronavirus death tolls and its GDP shrank by almost 10% in 2020, a more severe hit than in almost all other advanced economies.
Samuel Tombs, with consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Britain was probably was the Group of Seven's laggard for the last time in the first quarter, thanks to a fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccines which would boost growth into early 2022.
""Thereafter, however, the recovery likely will lose momentum and the UK will slip back towards the bottom of the pack, as other countries close the vaccination gap,"" Tombs said.
Last week, the Bank of England kept its economic stimulus programmes in place and, despite the signs of economic recovery, most of its monetary policymakers said they wanted to ""lean strongly against downside risks to the outlook"".
Separate ONS figures showed Britain's current account deficit narrowed to 12.828 billion pounds ($17.76 billion) in the first quarter as the tightening of coronavirus rules hit the economy and hurt demand for imports.
The balance of payments shortfall was equivalent to 2.4% of GDP compared with 4.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The deficit is a long-standing concern for investors because it leaves Britain reliant on foreign inflows of cash and is bigger than in many other similar economies.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment surged in June to a 21-year-high as an accelerated pace of COVID-19 vaccinations led to further reopening and an improved mood across all sectors of the economy, notably in retail and services.
The European Commission's monthly sentiment survey for the 19 countries sharing the euro on Tuesday showed optimism rising to 117.9 points in June from 114.5 in May, beating the consensus estimate in a Reuters poll of 116.5.
Sentiment became much more upbeat in services, the euro zone's biggest sector that is responsible for more than two thirds of gross domestic product. The sub-index rose to 17.9 points from 11.3 in May, far above expectations.
Retail sentiment rose to 4.5 points from 0.5 in May.
Optimism in industry, construction and among consumers also ticked up, although more modestly.
Sentiment in Germany hit an all-time high and improved in the six largest EU countries, except Spain, where it slightly declined.
The optimism translated into manufacturing industry's selling price expectations rising to 36.0 points in June from 29.9 in May, the highest reading in records stretching back to 1985.
Consumers also began to expect higher inflation over the next 12 months, with the reading going up to a 13-month high of 27.1.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Growth in China's June factory activity dipped to a four-month low on higher raw material costs, a shortage of semiconductors and a COVID-19 outbreak in the major export province of Guangdong, amid wider supply chain disruptions in Asia. 
The chip supply crunch has hammered other manufacturing powerhouses in Asia. Industrial output in Japan and South Korea slumped in May from the previous month as auto production declined due to semiconductor shortages, adding to concerns of flagging momentum in their respective economies.
China's June official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) eased slightly to 50.9 versus 51.0 in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. It, however, exceeded analysts' forecast for a slowdown to 50.8.
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The soft factory activity data aided a rebound in Chinese 
stocks on Wednesday as it eased fears of policy tightening.
""This was largely a result of COVID, which has affected factory output and also new export orders due to the rising waves of infections and resultant restrictions in some neighbouring economies,"" said Iris Pang, Great China chief economist at ING. 
""Overall, (it's) not a great month but no really worrying signs ... China's growth rate is still positive, though it would be a lot lower in H2 than H1, mostly because of the change in base effects,"" said Pang, referring to year-ago comparisons with 2020's pandemic disruptions.
The sub-index for production eased to 51.9, a four-month low, from 52.7 the previous month. Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the NBS, attributed the slowdown in production to constraining factors such as a shortage of semiconductors, inadequate coal supply, a power crunch and maintenance of equipment.
A shortage of coal supply in China's southern regions, which started in mid-May, hit factory operations though the government has said the power crunch should ease soon.
New export orders fell for a second consecutive month in June and at a faster pace, likely due to the global resurgence of COVID-19 variants, forcing some countries to reimpose lockdowns.
A sub-index for raw material costs in the official PMI stood at 61.2 in June, compared with May's 72.8, as the government cracked down on high raw material prices.
BRIGHT SPOTS
Growth in new orders, however, picked up, as domestic demand improved. 
Economists at Nomura believe the PMI prints were still solid in the second quarter, despite recent sequential moderation, pointing to the resilience of China's economy amid the recent resurgence of infections in Guangdong province.
""We expect the official manufacturing PMI to rebound slightly to 51.2 in July, thanks to the release of pent-up demand following the containment of latest wave of COVID-19, the recovery of some South China ports, and the relaxation of safety and environmental protection rules imposed before the 100th anniversary of the ruling party's foundation.""
The world's second-largest economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the pandemic, with the consumption and service sectors seen catching up to exports and manufacturing, though gross domestic product growth is set to moderate. 
""Much of the recovery has occurred and the momentum is slowing. Combined with a relatively higher base, this means year-on-year GDP growth is expected to slow to 7.2% in Q2 from 18.3% in Q1,"" said analysts at HSBC.
However, in two-year average terms, they expect growth to pick up to 5.2% from 5.0%, though this is still below pre-pandemic levels of 6.0% growth.

The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.5 in June from 55.2 in May, a separate survey from the NBS showed, dampened by a sharp pull-back in the recovery of the services sector due to local COVID outbreaks.
The construction index held steady at 60.1, although analysts expect the sector to face headwinds amid Beijing's clampdown on the property market.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity kept growing in June but at a slower pace, falling to a four-month low. Manufacturers were grappling with new challenges such as higher raw material costs, as well as a recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangdong province.
China’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 50.9 for June, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day. It was slightly higher than 50.8 figure in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but lower than May’s 51 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 53.5 in June, below May’s 55.2 figure.
They remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
The data also indicated that China’s economic recovery is steadying and more balanced among sectors, following its rapid growth as the economy recovered from COVID-19. Chinese policymakers were optimistic about the economy, saying earlier this week that it is showing more stability and strength despite global and domestic risks.
However, Chinese manufacturers still face challenges, including higher raw material costs and global supply chain bottlenecks. Meanwhile, a recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Guangdong, a major export province, disrupted shipments.
Factors such as a shortage of semiconductors, inadequate coal supply, a power crunch and maintenance of equipment contributed to the slowdown in production, NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe told Reuters.
Factory output remained expansion but at a slower pace, and job sentiments have improved, the NBS said in a statement. The services sector was affected by the “impact of regional pandemic outbreaks.” It added that air transport, hotels and catering had contracted in June.
Despite an accelerating vaccination and demand recovery globally, the stimulus measures China rolled out during COVID-19 are likely to fuel inflation and weigh on China’s manufacturing sector.
China’s regulators, however, said it would take measures to curb any unreasonable surges in commodity prices.
Investors now await the Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs to gauge progress in the private sector."

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's industrial output posted the biggest monthly drop in a year in May, as a sharp fall in car production threatened to undermine the country's economic recovery just weeks before Tokyo is set to host the Olympic Games.
The world's third-largest economy will likely grow at a much slower pace than initially thought in the current quarter in part due to weakness in consumer spending, a poll by economists showed this month.
Factory output slumped 5.9% in May from the previous month, official data showed on Wednesday, hit by declines in the manufacturing of cars and production machinery to post its largest monthly drop since May last year.
The contraction, which was the first drop in three months, was much weaker than a 2.4% fall forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. It followed a 2.9% gain in the previous month. 
Output was weighed by a 19.4% drop in motor vehicle production, largely due to supply issues with semiconductor chips, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said.
The car industry has a big impact on Japan's overall economy. Manufacturers of intermediate goods, such as tires and electrical lighting of passenger cars, are taking a hit from declines in motor vehicle production.
""The service sector was impacted by a state of emergency. If output comes in negative in the second quarter, the economy will be pushed down considerably,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""There's a possibility the economy will see negative growth,"" she said, adding that may show Japan as a laggard in its coronavirus recovery compared to other major global economies.
Manufacturers said they expected output to rebound 9.1% in June and drop 1.4% in July, though those forecasts may not fully take the global semiconductor supply issue into account, a trade ministry official said.
The worse-than-expected output data comes weeks before the start of the Tokyo Summer Olympics on July 23, which were already delayed by a year.
A successful staging of the Games may help boost confidence among the Japanese public, which could stimulate household consumption and broader demand conditions at home.
Separate figures on Tuesday showed retail sales rose for a third straight month in May, but failed to dispel worries that the economic recovery will take time to gather steam as COVID-19-linked pressures remained.

Japan's economy slipped into contraction in the first quarter as a late vaccine rollout and emergency measures put in place to stem a rise in infections have taken a toll on domestic demand, throwing into doubt the country's economic outlook.
Despite those setbacks, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura expects the economy to return to pre-coronavirus levels in the current fiscal year, which runs through March 2022.

The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, dropped to 53.5, lower than the 55.3 predicted by economists. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion in output.
The latest data adds to signs that China’s economic recovery is steadying after rapid expansion from the pandemic, with growth becoming more balanced among sectors. Top policy makers this week provided a positive assessment of the economy, saying it’s showing more stability and strength even though global and domestic risks remain.
Manufacturers continued to face constraints from supply chain bottlenecks and raw material price hikes in June. A Covid-19 outbreak in the Guangdong province caused a month of disruptions at Yantian, one of the world’s busiest container ports, and only restored normal operations last week. Price pressures remained elevated in the month, although there are signs they are beginning to cool.

The recovery in the services industry was likely affected by virus outbreaks in some parts of China and tightened movement control measures ahead of the Communist Party’s 100th anniversary celebrations.
Factory output continued to expand but at a slower pace, and job sentiments have improved, the NBS said in its statement. The services sector was affected by the “impact of regional pandemic outbreaks,” it said, adding that air transport, hotels and catering had contracted in the month.
The construction sector remained robust in June, with the pressure of rising construction costs easing somewhat, according to the NBS.
A sub-index of new export orders for factories remained below 50 for a second month, a sign of contraction. New orders continued to grow, with the sub-index rising to 51.5. The manufacturing employment index rose slightly to 49.2 in June, while non-manufacturing employment worsened to 48.

The British Retail Consortium's shop price index for June showed prices were 0.7% lower than a year before compared with a 0.6% fall in the year to May, which was the smallest drop since February 2020.
Shop prices as measured by the BRC typically show year-on-year price falls unlike the wider measure of consumer price inflation targeted by the Bank of England which includes services and a bigger range of goods.
The BoE said last week that CPI is likely to peak at more than 3%, above its 2% target, but the increase would be due largely to a global rise in energy prices and one-off supply chain problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The central bank stuck to its view that the rise in overall inflation was likely to be temporary.
""The fact that shop prices remain in negative territory despite the recent rise in CPI is indicative of the competitive retail landscape in the UK,"" said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ which co-produces the index.
BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said costs for retailers were rising due to higher food and fuel prices, Brexit-related red tape and supply chain disruption caused by the pandemic.

""The increasing cost burden on retailers may be passed onto the consumer, threatening price rises as the pressure mounts in the months ahead, especially with additional Brexit checks this autumn,"" she said.
The BRC collected price data between June 1 and June 7.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 03:51PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence at 16-month high; house price inflation heating up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence jumped to its highest level in nearly 1-1/2 years in June as growing labor market optimism amid a reopening economy offset concerns about higher inflation.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed a healthy appetite for long-lasting manufactured goods such as motor vehicles and household appliances, suggesting strong momentum in the economy as the second quarter ended. 
Consumers were also keen to purchase homes, a sign that house prices will continue to rapidly increase as supply lags. Many intended to go on vacation, mostly in the United States, over the next six months, which should boost demand for services and add fuel to consumer spending. 
""Consumers have plenty to be cheerful about after being cooped up at home for more than a year,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Looking ahead, low COVID infections, rebounding employment, and elevated savings will buoy confidence and push consumers to spend at a breakneck pace over the summer.""
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index raced to a reading of 127.3 this month, the highest level since February 2020, from 120.0 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 119.0. 
The survey places more emphasis on the labor market, which is steadily recovering. More than 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, allowing for broader economic re-engagement.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to 157.7 from 148.7 last month. The expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, rose to 107.0 from 100.9.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months rose to 6.7% from 6.5% last month.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 hitting a record high for the fourth straight session. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

STRONG LABOR MARKET VIEWS
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, vaulted to 43.5 in June. That was the highest level since 2000 and was up from 36.9 in May.
This measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report. The jump in the so-called labor market differential augurs well for June's employment report due out on Friday. There are a record 9.3 million job openings.
""This could indicate one million new nonfarm payroll jobs in Friday's report if the consumer is right,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. 
According a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 690,000 jobs in June after rising 559,000 in May. The unemployment rate is forecast falling to 5.7% from 5.8%. Though job growth has picked up, a shortage of willing workers is frustrating companies' efforts to ramp up hiring. 
The worker shortage has been blamed on generous unemployment benefits, including a weekly $300 subsidy from the federal government. A lack of child care facilities as some centers which shut during the pandemic never reopened, is also keeping some parents home.
At least 26 states are terminating federal government-funded unemployment benefits before the Sept. 6 expiration date. This, together with school districts expected to resume in-person classes in the fall, is seen expanding the labor pool.
This month, more consumers planned to buy homes, cars and major household appliances over the next six months, relative to May. That suggests demand for so-called durable goods will remain strong even as spending shifts backs to services such as air travel, dining out and hotel accommodation.
Economists are forecasting another double-digit rise in consumer spending this quarter, which is expected to lead to the economy growing at about a 10% annualized rate. Gross domestic product expanded at a 6.4% pace in the first quarter.
Accelerating home prices are curbing sales, which will likely limit the housing market's contribution to GDP growth this quarter. Demand for housing is being driven by historically low mortgage rates and shift to home offices during the pandemic. Other parts of the economy are also experiencing shortages and high prices because of bottlenecks in the supply chain. 
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas accelerated 14.9% year-on-year in April, the largest gain since December 2005. That followed a 13.4% increase in March.
(Graphic: Case Shiller, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbpgqodkpq/caseshiller.png) 
Soaring house price inflation was corroborated by another report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index shot up a record 15.7% in April from a year ago after rising 14.0% in March. 
Economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing as the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis. 

""We often get asked if we are in a housing bubble, but that is not necessarily the case,"" said Jordan van Rijn, senior economist at the Credit Union National Association. 
""There are structural factors at play, such as lower supply of existing homes, a shortage of materials and labor, and higher cost in materials.""

128,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>","Financial sector faces heavier burden in EU climate plans, sources say","By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is considering a wide range of measures to bring the bloc's financial sector into line with its climate plans, sources who have seen a European Commission strategy paper told Reuters.
The document outlines several actions including combating so-called greenwashing of investments, setting climate change targets for banks and encouraging low carbon blockchain projects, the sources said.
Entitled ""financing transition to a sustainable economy"", the paper builds on the EU executive's 2018 action which set the stage for the bloc's classification of truly green investments, and mandatory climate-related disclosures by companies. 
But the commission believes more action is needed because it has become clearer that Europe should improve how the financial sector contributes to sustainability, the sources said.
The EU's goal to eliminate its net emissions by 2050 will require huge investments, much of it private funding. Its system of classification, or taxonomy, aims to make green activities more visible and attractive to investors.
EU states will be asked to assess how their financial markets contribute to reaching the bloc's climate goals, covering asset managers, pension funds, banks and insurers.
A consolidated report on EU financial markets' transition will be delivered by the end of 2023, the sources said.
The commission will then coordinate with the European Central Bank and the bloc's banking watchdog to ""calibrate the right pace for the transition"".
There will be more work on labelling bonds as sustainable.
An ""initiative"" by the first quarter of 2023 will aim to make environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings of companies more reliable and comparable. The EU will also consider options to broaden out its taxonomy to cater better for investments in companies moving to a more sustainable footing, the sources said.

The strategy paper seeks to ""empower"" retail investors and small companies through green loans and mortgages, and better expertise of financial advisors in sustainability investments, 
There will be a ""digital sustainable finance roadmap"" by 2023 to foster investment in low emission data centres and blockchain technology, the sources said.

129,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 01:05PM ET</span>",U.S. home prices rose in April at fastest pace in 15 years - S&P/Case-Shiller,"By Evan Sully
(Reuters) -U.S. single-family home prices in 20 key urban markets rose in April from a year earlier by the most in over 15 years as the shortage of homes available to buy drives up prices at the fastest rate seen since before the financial crisis, a closely watched survey said on Tuesday.
The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 14.9% through the 12 months ended in April, the largest annual price increase since December 2005. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 14.5% increase. 
On a month-to-month basis, the 20-city composite index rose 1.6% from March. Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a 1.7% increase.
Among the twenty cities, Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle reported the highest year-over-year gains in April. 
""While the acceleration may be met with concerns, mortgage interest rates remain 50% lower than they were in 2005, when home price growth last peaked, keeping the ratio of mortgage payments to monthly households income lower today,"" Selma Hepp, CoreLogic Deputy Chief Economist said. ""It's probably that continued massive demand will keep pressure on prices, which are likely to remain at double-digit growth rate throughout the remainder of 2021.""
Similar data out Tuesday from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency showed its home price index gained a record-high 15.7% through the 12 months ended in April.
Home prices have surged nationwide in large part due to limited supply. Contrary to the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the current boom does not feature a frenzy of speculators and buyers with low credit scores buying homes and trying to flip them. Prices are at a record while sales volumes are still roughly 20% below their peak level in mid-2005.

""Despite sharply rising prices, demand for homes remains very strong,"" Zillow Economist Matthew Speakman said. ""Bidding wars for the relatively few houses available remain common and homes are going under contract at an increasingly fast pace. Inventory upticks in recent weeks suggest that a respite from these red-hot market conditions may be starting to form.""
Last week, the Commerce Department reported that sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a one-year low in May as expensive raw materials such as lumber continue to increase prices of newly constructed houses. Also, the National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes fell for a fourth consecutive month in May.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>",UK government set for leading role in insuring live entertainment,"By Carolyn Cohn and Barbara Lewis
LONDON (Reuters) - The British government is expected to announce an insurance scheme in the coming weeks for live events, including festivals, theatre and sports, to allow them to go ahead despite the pandemic, insurance industry sources said.
Insurers have since last year stripped COVID-19 from event cancellation insurance policies, meaning event organisers have no cover if a coronavirus outbreak forces them to tear up their schedules.
A report from a parliamentary committee last month called for a government-backed insurance scheme for live events, similar to a successful 500 million pounds ($696.05 million) scheme introduced for the film and TV industry last year.
The government is due to respond to the committee's report by the end of the month.
It was ""considering options"" on insurance and indemnity, Nigel Huddleston, a junior minister at Britain's culture ministry, told parliament last week.
""We are hopeful there will be an announcement,"" said Tim Thornhill, a director at insurance broker Tysers, highlighting the urgency given there have already been cancellations.
Music festival Womad cancelled its July 2021 festival on Monday, citing the government’s unwillingness to provide insurance support for festivals.
However, insurance industry sources said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has set up an ""events indemnity sprint team"" across several government departments and a government spokesperson said the department was working flat out to support live events. 
""We are aware of the wider concerns about securing indemnity cover and are exploring what further support may be required when the sector is able to reopen,"" a ministry spokesperson said by email. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said further lockdowns cannot be entirely ruled out, but that Britain is on course to lift most remaining COVID-19 restrictions on July 19. 
ECONOMIC VALUE
In pressing the case for government support, the cultural sector says it is a huge tourist draw and theatre closures last year and this year have dealt a heavy blow to the economy.
In 2019, before the pandemic, Britain's music industry alone contributed 5.8 billion pounds ($8.04 billion) to the economy, UK Music said.
After months of closure or pared back performances with reduced audiences to allow social distancing, planning ahead to revive the sector is all but impossible without events cancellation insurance, theatre and music directors say.
That makes government intervention crucial if the commercial sector will not pay.
""It would make a massive difference to us,"" said Neil McPherson, artistic director at the Finborough Theatre, an independent venue in west London.
""We basically have the choice of carrying on with productions with devastating repercussions if we have to cancel, or cancel completely in advance because we can't take the risk."" 
Andrew Lloyd-Webber and other West End impresarios last week also said a government-backed insurance scheme was vital.
Specialist insurers in the Lloyd's of London and broader London commercial insurance market would be likely to provide some initial cover, brokers said, but most would take the form of a backstop from the government.
That structure would enable the government to reduce its exposure as the risk of COVID-19 subsides. 
""There have to be insurers involved so there is an exit plan,"" said James Davies, divisional director, sport and entertainment at EC3 Brokers. Both Tysers and EC3 have provided data to the government to help it to design a scheme.
Industry sources are hoping for a scheme at least as large as the film and TV scheme. The larger the scheme, the greater the variety of events which could get cover, including conferences and weddings, they said.

Thornhill said modelling by Tysers showed the government could insure 1.1 billion pounds in event costs with 250-300 million pounds of insurance.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 10:21AM ET</span>",Electric car sales surge as Europe's climate targets bite,"By Kate Abnett
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - One in every nine new cars sold in Europe last year was an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle, with low-emission car sales surging even as the COVID-19 pandemic knocked overall vehicle sales, the European Environment Agency said on Tuesday.
The uptick in electric car sales caused a 12% drop in average CO2 emissions of new cars sold in Europe last year, compared with in 2019, reversing a trend that had seen such emissions increase for three consecutive years.
It was the biggest annual drop in such emissions since the EU introduced its car CO2 standards in 2010.
Of the 11.6 million new cars registered in the EU, Iceland, Norway and Britain last year, 11% were fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, according to the provisional data. 
Those vehicles tripled their share of new car sales, from 3.5% in 2019.
Tougher CO2 targets for carmakers came into force last year, pushing carmakers to curb their fleet-wide emissions by selling more low-emission vehicles, buy credits from other carmakers that overachieved their targets, or face fines. The EEA did not confirm which carmakers met their targets.
Countries including France and Germany also included electric vehicle subsidies in COVID-19 economic recovery packages last year.
While overall new car sales dropped, Europe's electric and plug-in hybrid car sales increased to more than 1 million in 2020.
Campaign group Transport & Environment said the data showed the emissions targets were working, but urged Brussels to propose CO2 standards that would ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2035, when it announces a package of climate policies next month.
EU officials said policymakers have not yet confirmed which specific car CO2 targets the Commission will propose.

The average car stays on the road for 10 to 15 years, and campaigners say selling polluting vehicles after 2035 would thwart the EU's target to have net zero emissions by 2050.
Average emissions for new cars registered in Europe were 107.8 grams of CO2 per kilometre in 2020, a decrease of 14.5 grams compared with 2019.

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 2.1% in June, down from 2.4% in May.
The June reading was in line with a Reuters forecast.
The national consumer price index (CPI) slowed to 2.3% in June from 2.5% in May.
Germany's preliminary inflation data does not include a harmonized figure for core inflation which strips out more volatile index components such as energy and food costs.
But a breakdown of the non-harmonized data showed that energy and food inflation rose a little less strongly in June while prices for rents and goods accelerated at the same pace.
""There are increasing signs that underlying price pressure is picking up slightly,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Marco Wagner said, adding that clothing, overnight stays and restaurant visits had become noticeably more expensive.
The German central bank earlier this month lifted its inflation forecast to 2.6% this year, which would be the highest since 2008.
The Bundesbank has played down the significance of the surge, blaming it mainly on energy prices and tax effects. Without those, it said, inflation would stand at just 1%, in line with last year and well below 2019's level.

The sudden surge in prices, which could see inflation touch 4% in the second half of 2021, might affect perceptions after a long period of low inflation and impact consumer behaviour.
Citing the temporary nature of price rises, both the central bank and government expect inflation to ease again next year despite an expected strong economic recovery.

The finance ministry said that payment card data showed spending was up 18% in the third week of June from the same period of 2019 with little sign of easing in the weeks after coronavirus restrictions were relaxed.
""The real surprise is that it's holding up over time,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Cnews television. ""That proves that (consumers) are using their savings for consumption and reviving the economy."" 
Spending on electronic goods was up more than 45%, and nearly 30% on clothes while spending in hotels and restaurants was up more than 10%, the data showed.
Shops, museums, cinemas and theatres reopened on May 19, ending the country's third nationwide lockdown since the pandemic emerged last year. 
Since then cafes, bars and restaurants have gradually been allowed to have more patrons and a national night-time curfew ended on June 20, 10 days earlier than initially scheduled as infection numbers fell and a vaccination campaign gained speed.
With restrictions relaxed, consumer confidence surged in June to its highest level since March last year, just before the outbreak swept across the country.
The INSEE official statistics agency said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index jumped to 102 in June from 98 in May, surpassing economists' average expectation for a reading of 100 in a Reuters poll.

It also showed that concerns about unemployment were the lowest since the outbreak first started while pessimism about the general economic outlook was the weakest since December 2017.
Separately, INSEE said that unemployment ticked only marginally higher in the first quarter, rising to 8.1% from 8.0% in the previous three months.

136,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2021 03:06AM ET</span>",Pandemic boom drives UK house prices up by most since 2004,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices jumped by the most in more than 16 years this month, soaring by 13.4% from June 2020, and demand is expected to stay strong while a coronavirus emergency tax break remains in place, mortgage lender Nationwide said.
In monthly terms, house prices were 0.7% higher than in May as buyers rushed to take advantage of the tax incentive and sought bigger homes after their experiences of lockdown.
""While the strength is partly due to base effects, with June last year unusually weak due to the first lockdown, the market continues to show significant momentum,"" Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said on Tuesday.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 13.7% in annual terms and by 0.7% from May. 
The tax break, introduced last year as part of British finance minister Rishi Sunak's emergency support for the economy, had originally been due to expire at the end of March. 
But the first 500,000 pounds ($693,250) of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland are now due to remain exempt until the end of June, and a 250,000 pound tax-free allowance will run until the end of September.
""Underlying demand is likely to remain solid in the near term as the economy unlocks,"" Gardner said. 
""Consumer confidence has rebounded while borrowing costs remain low. This, combined with a lack of supply on the market, suggests further upward pressure on prices. But as we look toward the end of the year, the outlook is harder to foresee.""
THE BOE IS WATCHING 
As well as the tax break, Sunak's huge jobs support programme is also due to be phased out by the end of September, raising fears of an increase in unemployment. 
Nationwide said it was still possible that the shift in demand for larger properties seen during the pandemic would continue to help the market once the tax break is gone.
The lender published a survey last month showing that almost seven in 10 homeowners who were considering a move would be doing it even without the extension of the tax incentive.
Nationwide said house prices were close to a record high relative to incomes, making it harder for first-time buyers to raise a deposit. But mortgage payments were not high as a proportion of pay, due mostly to low mortgage rates. 
The Bank of England has said is monitoring the housing market as it weighs up the chances of a broader pick-up in inflation as the economy reopens. 
Last week, the central bank left its key interest rate at an all-time low or 0.1% and made no change to its plan to increase its government bond purchases to 895 billion pounds.
Despite the signs of recovery in Britain's economy, most BoE rate-setters said they wanted to ""lean strongly against downside risks to the outlook"".

Nationwide said house prices in London rose at the slowest rate of any region in England during the second quarter of 2021 but they still increased by 7.3%. Northern Ireland was the strongest performing region, with prices up 14% year-on-year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales beat expectations in May as households loosened their purse strings, but underlying trends in consumption remain hostage to COVID-19-linked pressures and suggest the economic recovery will take time to gather steam. 
With Tokyo set to host the Olympic Games next month, analysts expect Japan's economy will barely grow in the second quarter after prolonged coronavirus emergency curbs hurt the growth outlook.
As major global economies such as the United States rebound strongly from the COVID-19 slump, the weak growth rate in Japan is pressuring policymakers to take fresh supportive measures on top of the massive existing stimulus to boost demand.
Retail sales jumped 8.2% in May from a year earlier, the third straight month of growth, government data showed on Tuesday, a larger rise than the median market forecast for a 7.9% gain. 
Despite the better-than-expected rise in retail sales, the jump was not strong enough to mark a definite shift towards a brighter outlook for spending conditions, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Many elderly were unlikely to go out and spend money in April and May as there was still a state of emergency or quasi-emergency measures (in major areas),"" said Minami.
""It's hard to imagine that the Olympics will set off a spending rush,"" he said, adding that risks remained that another resurgence in COVID-19 infections would weigh on consumption ahead.
The broader rise in retail sales, which was largely due to statistical base effects that reflected last year's slide, was underpinned by year-on-year gains in spending on items such as general merchandise, clothing, cars and fuel, the data showed.
But compared with the previous month, retail sales lost 0.4% on a seasonally adjusted basis, in a sign the trend for spending by Japanese consumers was losing steam.
Separate data showed the nationwide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was up at 3.0%, above the previous month's 2.8% and a median forecast of 2.9%.

There were 1.09 jobs per applicant in May, unchanged from April, labour ministry data showed. 
The world's third-largest economy is set to expand by an annualised 0.5% in the current quarter after posting a sharp 3.9% annualised drop in January-March, according to the latest Reuters poll data.

The ministry said that after a 1.5% decline last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, a fall that was modest compared to most other developed countries, exports have done well so far this year, with goods exports up 2% and services exports up 15%.
Software and computers services, which make up most of high-tech exports, are up more than 20% so far in 2021, the ministry said.
Service exports rose 11.6% in 2020 to $43.4 billion and have risen an average of 13% a year since 2016.

High tech is a key economic growth driver for Israel, accounting for some 12% of economic output and 10% of the country's labour force. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, a former tech executive, has set a target of raising the tech workforce to 15% by 2026.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2021 03:16AM ET</span>",China's factory activity seen growing at a slower pace in June: Poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese factory activity likely expanded at a slower pace in June, hit by a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the major export province of Guangdong, a Reuters poll showed on Monday, though quick containment indicates economic disruption is easing. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is likely to ease to 50.8 in June from 51 in May, showed the median forecast of 32 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
""The key drag would be COVID disruption on Shenzhen ports, accounting for about 7% of national exports, which has led to slower container throughput growth,"" said analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in a note to clients.
""This could weigh down national exports by 3-4 percentage points, and thus drag the pace of production in mid- to downstream sectors. Meanwhile, construction activity likely slowed amid higher raw material prices.""
More than 150 novel coronavirus cases have been reported in Guangdong province, a manufacturing and exporting hub in southern China, since the latest wave of cases struck in late May, prompting local governments to step up prevention and control efforts that have curbed port processing capacity. 
But port congestion is easing, with Shenzhen's Yantian Port, which had been hit by a COVID-19 outbreak, resuming full capacity on Saturday, state media reported. Guangdong has not reported any COVID-19 cases in six days.
Chinese exporters, which have defied expectations of a slowdown since the beginning of the pandemic, are grappling with a global shortage of semiconductors, high raw material costs and sky-rocketing shipping fees as a surge in global demand for Chinese goods stretches global shipping capacity. 
Chinese officials have said they would curb any unreasonable increases in commodity prices. The state planner has launched investigations into the coal, iron ore and fertiliser markets.
Meanwhile, at China's industrial firms, profit growth slowed again in May, official data showed on Sunday, as surging raw material prices squeezed margins and weighed on factory activity.

The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Wednesday.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Thursday. Analysts expect the headline reading will slip slightly to 51.8 from May's 52.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2021 10:30PM ET</span>",China's industrial profit growth slows amid high raw material prices,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed again in May as surging raw material prices squeezed margins and weighed on factory activity.
Profits at China's industrial firms rose 36.4% in May from a year earlier to 829.92 billion yuan ($128.58 billion) official data showed on Sunday.
That was a slowdown from the 57% surge reported in April, according to National Bureau of Statistics.
The world's second-largest economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by COVID-19, but it faces new challenges such as elevated raw material costs and global supply chain crunches. Officials warn that China's recovery remains uneven.
Imbalances in profitability became prominent between upstream and downstream firms due to high commodity prices, said Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau.
""The foundation for recovery is not yet solid,"" he said in a statement accompanying the data. 
Profits grew rapidly in the metals, chemicals and petroleum sectors, while smaller and downstream enterprises saw much more pressure, Zhu said. 
For the January-May period, industrial firms' profits grew 83.4% from the same period a year earlier to 3.42 trillion yuan. 
Factory-gate inflation saw its fastest annual growth in over 12 years in May driven by surging commodity prices, posing risks to profit margins for mid- and downstream firms.
Chinese policymakers have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to cool runaway metals prices, including selling supplies from state reserves, but with global demand continuing to recover some analysts believe the moves will have only a limited impact.
China's official manufacturing data this week is expected to show weaker growth in activity in June, likely due to disruptions caused by COVID-19 flare-ups at the country's major southern ports. In addition, investors will be looking to trends in input costs and selling prices for any further signs of margin pressure.

Liabilities at industrial firms were up 8.2% year-on-year at the end of May, versus 8.6% growth a month earlier.
The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment ticked up in June, driven by an improving economic outlook among affluent households, a survey released on Friday showed.
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index rose to a final reading of 85.5 from May's final level of 82.9, though it was below June's preliminary reading of 86.4.
That was below the median forecast of 86.5 among economists polled by Reuters.
""All of the June gain was among households with incomes above $100,000, and mainly in the way they judged future economic prospects,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. Also, a record 56% of respondents expect a drop in unemployment in the year ahead.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 88.6 from May's 89.4, and also down from June's preliminary reading of 90.6.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations jumped to 83.5 in June from May's 78.8, but down modestly from the mid-month reading of 83.8.
""While many are optimistic about a gradual end to the pandemic, consumers still judged the risks from emerging COVID variants as appreciable,"" Curtin said. ""It is likely that consumers will not reduce their savings and wealth to pre-pandemic levels, but maintain a higher level of precautionary funds.""

The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 4.2% from May's final reading of 4.6%, while the survey's five-year inflation outlook declined to 2.8% from 3%.
""Not only did year-ahead inflation expectations fall slightly to 4.2% in June from May's decade peak of 4.6%, consumers also believed that the price surges will mostly be temporary,"" Curtin said. ""The growing strength in the economy meant that nearly three-quarters of all consumers expected rising interest rates during the year ahead, the highest proportion since 2018 when the economy was near its last peak.""

142,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2021 12:41PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending takes breather amid shortages; inflation rises,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending paused in May as shortages hurt motor vehicle purchases, but the supply constraints and increased demand for services helped to lift prices, with the Federal Reserve's main inflation measure rising by the most in 29 years.
There was, however, some good news on inflation. Consumers this month perceived higher inflation to be temporary, a survey showed on Friday, aligning with the views of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Consumers' inflation expectations are key as they can influence households' behavior.
With at least 150 million Americans fully vaccinated against COVID-19, which is allowing the economy to reopen and people to travel, dine out and engage in other activities that were restricted during the pandemic, consumer spending is expected to pick up in the coming months. Trillions of dollars in excess savings and rising household wealth due to gains in stock prices and home values are expected to provide a powerful tailwind. 
""Spending growth will shift to services from goods, and drive a strong economic recovery throughout the rest of 2021 and all of 2022,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh. ""The biggest drags are higher prices for some goods and services and shortages due to production bottlenecks.""
The unchanged reading in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, followed an upwardly revised 0.9% jump in April, the Commerce Department said. Consumer spending was previously reported to have increased 0.5% in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would rise 0.4% in May. 
Motor vehicles and some household appliances are scarce because of supply bottlenecks stemming from the pandemic. A global shortage of semiconductors is hampering motor vehicle production. Spending is also starting to shift back to the services part of the economy, which accounts for two-thirds of consumer spending, though the pace last month was insufficient to offset the drag from goods. 
Spending on services rose 0.7%, led by recreation, restaurants and hotels as well as housing and utilities. Spending on goods fell 1.3%, with outlays of long-lasting goods like motor vehicles tumbling 2.8%. Goods spending surged as the pandemic confined people to their homes. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.5% after advancing 0.7% in April. In the 12 months through May, the so-called core PCE price index shot up 3.4%, the largest gain since April 1992. The core PCE price index rose 3.1% on a year-on-year basis in April. 
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% target. Year-on-year inflation is accelerating in part as last spring's weak readings drop from the calculation. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher, with the S&P 500 index hitting a record high as investors focused on the moderation in the monthly inflation reading. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower. 
Graphic: Inflation on the rise - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/rlgpdrwrqpo/chart_eikon.jpg 
NO RUNAWAY INFLATION
Though the so-called base effects likely peaked in May, inflation will probably remain high in the near term because of the supply constraints and worker shortages, which are boosting wage growth.
""While we foresee increased inflation stickiness, with core PCE inflation hovering around 3.0% in the second half (of the year), we don't foresee runaway inflation,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Consumers seem to agree. The University of Michigan consumer survey's one-year inflation expectation dropped to 4.2% in June from a decade-high 4.6% in May. The survey noted that ""consumers also believed that the price surges will mostly be temporary.""
The five-to-10-year inflation expectation fell to 2.8% this month from 3.0% in May. Fed officials put more emphasis on the five-to-10-year series.
Powell acknowledged this week that ""inflation has increased notably in recent months,"" but told lawmakers that the U.S. central bank ""will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation."" 
Graphic: A Fed favorite? - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/INFLATION/jznpnybdbvl/chart_eikon.jpg 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.4% last month after rising 0.3% in April. Despite May's drop in the so-called real consumer spending, consumption is running higher than its pace in the first quarter.
Gross domestic product growth estimates for this quarter are around a 9% annualized rate, which would be an acceleration from the 6.4% pace logged in the first quarter. Economists believe the economy could achieve growth of at least 7% this year. That would be the fastest growth since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years. 
In addition to the supply squeeze, the ebbing boost from government stimulus checks likely restrained consumer spending last month. Transfer payments from the government dropped 11.7%. That resulted in personal income falling 2.0% after declining 13.1% in April. 

But there is ample fuel to drive spending. Wages gained 0.8% after rising 1.0% in April. The saving rate fell to a still-lofty 12.4% from 14.5% in April. Households accumulated at least $2.5 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic.
From July through December some households will receive income under the expanded Child Tax Credit program, which will soften the blow of an early termination of government-funded unemployment benefits in 26 states.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's balance of payments position with the world improved again in May, central bank figures showed on Friday, as the second consecutive monthly current account surplus shrank the rolling 12-month deficit to its smallest in more than 13 years.
Latin America's largest economy also attracted a combined $7.2 billion of foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows into its domestic stock and bond markets in the month, the figures showed.
The narrowing current account deficit and consistent capital inflows recently have helped propel a rapid rise in the exchange rate, with the dollar now trading below 5.00 reais for the first time in a year. 
Central bank figures show that Brazil posted a $3.8 billion current account surplus in May, slightly less than the $4 billion median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
That was largely thanks to a goods trade surplus of $8.1 billion in the month. Exports jumped 54.4% from the same month last year to a record $27.2 billion, outstripping a 31.9% increase in imports.
In the 12 months to May, the current account deficit totaled $8.4 billion, or 0.55% of gross domestic product, which was the smallest since February 2008. The deficit a year earlier stood at almost 4% of GDP.
On Thursday, the central bank raised its 2021 current account surplus forecast slightly to $3 billion from $2 billion. That would be the country's first annual surplus since 2007.
On the capital flows side, foreign direct investment in May totaled $1.2 billion, the central bank said. That was less than the $2.5 billion forecast in the Reuters poll.
Based on partial data already in for June, the central bank said it expects a current account surplus of $6.5 billion and FDI inflows of $2.5 billion in the month.
Investors plowed a net $6 billion into Brazilian stocks and bonds in May. Stocks saw a $2.9 billion inflow and debt securities attracted $3.1 billion, the central bank said.

On Thursday, the central bank more than doubled its 2021 portfolio inflows forecast to $21 billion from $10 billion. Net inflows in the 12 months through May totaled $41.8 billion, the central bank said.

Power and LMC Automotive said on Friday.
Retail sales for new vehicles in June are estimated to reach 1.1 million units, up 12.4% from last year, the companies said in a statement, lower than their expectations for 34% and 110% growth in May and April, respectively.
Total new-vehicle sales for June, including retail and non-retail, are projected to reach 1.3 million units, a 19.5% increase compared with the same period in 2020.
""The effect of fewer vehicles in inventory at dealerships is finally starting to have a material effect on aggregate industry sales volumes, as eager buyers struggle to find their desired new vehicle,"" said Thomas King, president of data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
Average transaction prices are expected to rise 14.9% to $40,206, the highest on record, while the average incentive spending per unit is expected to fall to $2,492 from $4,349 last year.

""Consumers are buying more expensive vehicles despite smaller discounts, which is dramatically increasing the profitability of those sales for both manufacturers and retailers,"" King added.
The total seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 15.8 million vehicles, up 2.6 million units from 2020 but 1.4 million units less than 2019.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian consumer inflation rose above 8% in the month to mid-June for the first time in almost five years, figures showed on Friday, driven by strong rises in gasoline and electricity prices.
The IPCA-15 annual price index rose to 8.1% from 7.3% a month earlier, statistics agency IBGE said, another sharp rise that shows why the central bank last week again raised interest rates aggressively to try and keep 2022 inflation expectations in check.
That was the highest level since October 2016, and just shy of the 8.2% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. A year ago, annual inflation was under 2%.
The 0.83% monthly rate of inflation in mid-June was virtually double the 0.44% the month before and also pretty much in line with a Reuters poll estimate of 0.86%. 
According to IBGE, prices rose in all nine groups of goods and services covered. 
Transport costs rose 1.35% in the month, accounting for just over a quarter of the overall rise, IBGE said. Within that segment, gasoline prices jumped 2.9% and are now up 46% over the last 12 months.
Housing costs rose 1.67% in the month, also accounting for around a quarter of the overall rise, led by a 3.9% surge in electricity prices, IBGE said.
The central bank's year-end inflation goal is 3.75% with a margin of error of 1.5 percentage point on either side, and its central target for next year is 3.50%. 

The central bank last week raised its benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points for a third time to 4.25%. Minutes of the meeting showed that policymakers discussed an even bigger increase and could make a bolder move in August.
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said on Thursday that many of the recent inflation surprises were transitory but had spread. He said the central bank would use all the tools at its disposal to ensure its 2022 inflation goal was met.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output likely fell in May while retail sales rose for a third straight month, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, highlighting the uneven recovery in the world's third largest economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The mixed data forecast comes as the government lifted a state of emergency in Tokyo and elsewhere this week to ease curbs on service-sector firms such as bars and restaurants, stoking worries about a resurgence of infections a little less than a month before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics.
While pent-up demand may underpin private consumption, which makes up more than half of the economy, a global chip shortage may weigh on an export-led recovery, analysts say.
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry data out at 8:50 a.m. June 30 (2350 GMT June 29) is expected to show factory output fell 2.4% month-on-month in May, reversing from a 2.9% gain in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of 17 economists.
Factory activity is seen as a key driver of economic recovery, led by global demand for cars and electronics, but the chip shortage is likely to weigh on auto production and shipments in the coming months, analysts say.
""Overseas economies will continue to recover but cuts in car production will drag on, causing factory output to seesaw in June and July as well,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Japan's economy likely avoided falling into recession this quarter but an extension of emergency measures to stem a rise in coronavirus infections has dented the growth outlook, a separate Reuters poll showed.
Separate METI data due at 8:50 a.m. June 29 (2350 GMT June 28) is expected to show retail sales grew 7.9% in May, following a 12% increase in April, likely driven by pent-up demand from COVID-19 curbs and rises in gasoline prices.

While the job availability and jobless rate probably little changed at 1.08 and 2.9% respectively in May, housing starts are expected to have increased 8.3% in the year to May, which would mark a third straight month of annual gains.
Job data will be published at 8:30 a.m. June 29 (2330 GMT June 28) and housing starts data will be issued at 2 p.m. June 30 (0500 GMT).

GfK's consumer confidence index remained at -9 in June, unchanged from May and its highest since early March 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a small rise to -7.
""Forecasts for rising retail price inflation could weaken consumer confidence quickly and that may account for the six-point dip in June in our measure for the wider economy in the coming year,"" GfK's client strategy director, Joe Staton, said.
The Bank of England warned on Thursday https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2E019B that consumer price inflation was likely to temporarily exceed 3% later this year, after a bigger-than-expected jump to 2.1% in May.
Households in the GfK survey, which began in 1974, were more upbeat about the outlook for their personal and their willingness to make bigger purchases.

Britain's economy shrank almost 10% last year, its biggest decline in more than 300 years, but the impact was softened for many households by a job furlough scheme that paid 80% of their previous wages.
The number of workers on furlough has fallen sharply since the end of March, as shops and restaurants reopen, but around 1.5 million staff are yet to return to work. The programme ends on Sept. 30.

150,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 04:54PM ET</span>","Banks Easily Clear Stress Tests, Setting Stage for Payouts","(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street banks are poised to announce a deluge of dividend increases and stock buybacks after the Federal Reserve’s stress tests showed the industry built up a stockpile of cash during the pandemic.
Lenders can announce their plans for distributing capital after the market closes on June 28, and the industry’s strong results mean payouts may be the largest ever following the Fed’s annual exams. Early estimates indicate the six biggest U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., could return more than $140 billion to shareholders.
The passing marks -- announced Thursday by the Fed -- mean firms are officially free from restrictions that the regulator put on dividend payments and share repurchases last year when Covid-19 was ravaging the economy. The banks’ solid showing also signals that the industry has grown much more comfortable with the exercises, which used to trigger anxiety and frustration across Wall Street.
In the Fed’s invented economic pain in this year’s exams, the biggest U.S. banks saw their aggregate common equity tier 1 capital ratio fall to a minimum of 10.6%, which is still more than twice the 4.5% minimum the agency demands.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). was -- as usual -- among the megabanks closest to the edge, with 8.8%.  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. joined it at that level.
“Over the past year, the Federal Reserve has run three stress tests with several different hypothetical recessions and all have confirmed that the banking system is strongly positioned to support the ongoing recovery,” Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said in a statement.
Banks rose in postmarket trading with Bank of America Corp.,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Goldman all gaining.

The hypothetical crisis envisioned in this year’s exams -- including a nearly 11% unemployment rate and the stock market tanking by more than half -- produced unique loss figures for each of the 23 lenders tested based on their differing books of business.
The banks use those numbers to assess how much capital they can afford to dole out to investors, a metric known as the stress capital buffer. Unlike in previous exams, banks don’t need the Fed to sign-off on their capital plans, as long as each lender stays above its established capital minimum.
If a bank falls below its required stress capital buffer at any point in the year following the stress tests, the Fed can hit it with sanctions, including restrictions on capital distributions and bonus payments.
Even before the results were released, Wall Street lobbyists were defending the industry’s plans to boost payouts to shareholders. Kevin Fromer, president of the Financial Services Forum in Washington, argued this week that increased dividends and buybacks are “a promising sign for the economy.”
Such comments aren’t likely to impress Senator Elizabeth Warren and other progressive lawmakers. The Massachusetts Democrat has repeatedly criticized buybacks, labeling them a form of market manipulation that enriches executives. Banks should instead use their excess capital to invest in their businesses and their employees, she’s argued.

(Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in several Midwestern and Rocky Mountain states ticked up in June, driven by demand for durable goods such as fabricated metals and machinery, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City said on Thursday.
The Kansas City Fed's monthly survey of manufacturing activity across its district showed its composite index rose to 27 in June from 26 in May, edging back toward April's record-high level. Meanwhile, the bank's measure of production in the district - which covers Kansas, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming and parts of Missouri and New Mexico - declined to 30 from 32, also after reaching a record high in April.
""Manufacturers reported that stronger demand and growth were primary factors supporting business investment and capital spending for the remainder of 2021,"" the survey said. ""On the other hand, manufacturers also reported the lack of availability of parts and employees were primary factors restraining business investment and capital spending for the rest of 2021.""
Manufacturing employment strengthened in the district and price pressures eased a touch but remained near historically high levels.
The bank's measure of the number of employees rose to 26 in June from 20 a month earlier. The gauge of prices paid for materials pulled back to 79 from May's record-high 86, and the index for prices received for finished products fell to 48 from 51.
Looking ahead, the bank's future composite index reached a new survey record high, increasing from 33 to 37 in June.
Factories have struggled to keep up with demand in recent months as the U.S. economy shows signs of emerging from the COVID-19 recession and consumers flush with cash from recent stimulus programs ramp up spending.
The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that orders for durable goods rose 2.3% in May.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 01:21PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market healing; businesses boost spending as profits rebound,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week as the labor market steadily recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic amid a reopening economy, but a dearth of willing workers could hinder faster job growth in the near term.
The economy appears to be at cruising speed more than half way through the second quarter, with other data on Thursday showing strong growth in business spending on equipment in May. While the goods trade deficit widened, that was because of an increase in imports as businesses desperately try to keep up with robust demand. Retailers' warehouses are almost bare.
""It looks like the economy continues to astound us with the speed and strength of the recovery from what is turning out to be the quickest recession in history,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 411,000 for the week ended June 19, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 6,000 more applications received than previously reported. The first increase since late April was blamed by economists on volatility in the aftermath of the May 31 Memorial Day holiday.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 380,000 applications for the latest week. There was a surge in claims in Pennsylvania last week. The state upgraded its filing system this month and the transition could have caused a backlog. There were sizeable declines in California, Florida and Illinois.
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, but are still above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. Despite last week's modest decline, layoffs are trending lower, with companies scrambling to fill a record 9.8 million job openings.
The claims data could become volatile in the weeks ahead as 26 states with mostly Republican governors pull out of federal government-funded unemployment programs, including a $300 weekly check, which businesses complained were encouraging the jobless to stay at home. The early termination started on June 5 and will run through July 31. 
Louisiana is the only state with a Democratic governor to terminate federal benefits. For the rest of the country, these benefits will lapse on Sept. 6. There is no evidence so far of a surge in job searches in the 12 states that have already ended the federal benefits. 
""The fits and starts in the labor market should be expected and imply that a premature withdrawal of support for the unemployed would be a policy error that will reduce overall economic activity,"" said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM in New York.
At least 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, allowing the economy to begin reopening. A shortage of childcare facilities is keeping some parents, mostly women, outside the labor force. Some people also are hesitant to return to work out of fear of contracting the virus. Pandemic-related retirements and transitions into new careers are factors as well.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that he believed the economy would see strong job creation in the fall.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes hitting all-time highs. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

The number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 144,000 to 3.390 million in the week ending June 12. At least 14.8 million people were receiving unemployment checks under all programs in the first week of June, compared to 31.3 million during the same period in 2020.
In addition to the brightening public health situation, trillions of dollars in pandemic relief from the government are underpinning the economy. In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said shipments of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.9% in May after gaining 1.0% in April. 
Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. But supply bottlenecks could be slowing momentum.
Still, a strong rebound in corporate profits and excess savings accumulated by households should allow factories to weather the production and labor supply constraints. Profits from current production increased $55.2 billion in the first quarter after decreasing $31.4 billion the fourth quarter.
""We expect strong revenues this year while margins remain well-supported as stronger productivity growth and increased pricing power offset higher labor costs,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The summer will be hot for the U.S. economy.""
Strong demand and tight supply are forcing businesses to turn to imports, boosting the trade deficit. In a third report, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 2.8% to $88.1 billion in May. While inventories at wholesalers rose 1.1%, stocks at retailers dropped 0.8%. That mostly reflected a 5.3% decline in inventories of motor vehicles. Auto production has been hampered by a global semiconductor shortage.

The swelling goods trade deficit and falling retail inventories did little to change economists' robust GDP growth expectations for this quarter, with estimates around a 10% annualized rate. The Commerce Department confirmed in a fourth report that economic growth accelerated in the first quarter, thanks to the massive fiscal stimulus. 
The economy grew at a 6.4% rate last quarter, unrevised from the estimate published in May. That followed a 4.3% pace of expansion in the fourth quarter.

153,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 24, 2021 09:11AM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders dip in May; shipments increase solidly,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods unexpectedly fell in May, likely held back by shortages of some products, but a solid increase in shipments suggested business spending remained strong in the second quarter.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dipped 0.1% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders jumped 2.7% in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 0.6%. Orders increased 16.3% year-on-year in May.
Business investment on equipment has enjoyed double-digit growth over the last three quarters thanks to a shift in demand towards goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic and massive fiscal stimulus to ease the blow to the economy from the public health crisis.
Though demand is starting to revert back to services as vaccinations allow for broader economic re-engagement, appetite for goods remains healthy. But manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is experiencing shortages of labor and raw materials, causing shortages that are boosting prices. 
Last month, core capital goods orders were held down by machinery and fabricated metal products, as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components increased 1.3%.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.9% after advancing 1.0% in April. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
With households sitting on more than $2 trillion in excess savings, demand booming and inventories low, businesses are likely to continue investing in equipment to boost production.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rebounded 2.3% in May after falling 0.8% in April. They were lifted by a 7.6% rise in orders for transportation equipment.
Orders for civilian aircraft increased 27.4%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 73 aircraft order compared to only 25 aircraft in April. 

Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 2.1% in May after decreasing 8.1% in April. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products has also been impacted. 
Unfilled durable goods orders increased 0.8% in May after rising 0.4% in April.

Initial claims in regular state programs decreased by 7,000 to 411,000 in the week ended June 19, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 380,000 new applications. The prior week’s claims were revised up to 418,000.
Weekly unemployment claims have fallen considerably since the beginning of the year as health concerns abate and businesses like restaurants return to full capacity. Still, the initial claims remain significantly higher than they were before Covid-19 and many employers say they are having trouble finding workers.
Federal Reserve officials are focused on achieving maximum employment, which they define as a “broad and inclusive goal.” In a congressional hearing Tuesday, Chair Jerome Powell said that the labor market has a long way to go and needs continued support.
“The very quick job gains of the early recovery essentially involved going back to your old job,” Powell said. “Now it’s actually finding new jobs and that’s a that’s a matching function that that is more labor intensive and time consuming.”

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer confidence in Brazil rose in June to a seven-month high, a survey indicated on Thursday, a third consecutive increase as households looked through the current wave of COVID-19 to brighter economic prospects in the coming months.
The Getulio Vargas Foundation's (FGV) consumer confidence index rose 4.7 points to 80.9 points in June, the highest since November, FGV said, with future expectations rising much faster than the current conditions index. 
Graphic: Brazil consumer confidence - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprzjodpe/consconf.png 
""For the first time since July last year, intentions to buy durable goods has risen more sharply, which seems related to greater optimism regarding the labor market in the coming months,"" said survey coordinator Viviane Seda Bittencourt.
The index remains below its pre-pandemic level of 87.8 in February last year, however. 

The current situation index rose 2.9 points to 71.6, while the expectations index jumped 5.9 points to 88.3, FGV said.
The rise in confidence was spread across all income brackets, especially those consumers at the top earning more than 9,600 reais ($1,940) a month, FGV said. Confidence among those consumers rose to the highest level since February last year, just before the pandemic struck. ($1 = 4.96 reais)

EDC's Trade Confidence Index jumped 19% from end-2020 to mid-2021, the largest 6-month increase since the survey began in 1999, the agency said. The recovery appears to be broad-based across all regions of the country, it said.
""It's just extraordinary that this kind of rush is happening. It's really telling us that everybody is arming themselves for what's coming in the second half of this year,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at EDC. 
Canada's economy - like those of many of its global peers - is set to boom in the second half of 2021, as widespread public vaccinations allow businesses to reopen and consumers begin to dip into their pandemic savings. 
A strong rebound south of the border is also expected to help. A growing share of companies reported orders from customers in the United States, Canada's largest trading partner, had improved in the past six months, EDC said. 
And 65% of respondents said they are planning to export to new markets, with the UK and Australia top destinations. Exports account for about a third of Canada's gross domestic product.

But concerns remain, notably the strong Canadian dollar - which hit a six-year high earlier this month - and mounting worries over trade protectionism, especially U.S. President Joe Biden's ""Buy American"" plan and fraught China-Canada relations.
The survey was conducted between April and June, spanning a period that saw fresh lockdowns amid a harsh third wave of COVID-19 infections followed by the early stages of reopening.

BERLIN (Reuters) -German business morale rose by more than expected in June and hit its highest level since November 2018 on companies' surging optimism about the second half of the year in Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index rose to 101.8 from 99.2 in May. A Reuters poll of analysts had pointed to a June reading of 100.6.
""The German economy is shaking off the coronavirus crisis,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday Germany was on the verge of a strong economic upswing, adding that Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann had given a very positive assessment of the economic outlook to the cabinet.
Germany's central bank raised its growth forecasts earlier this month and now expects the economy to reach pre-pandemic levels as soon as next quarter and grow by 3.7% this year and 5.2% next year.
German authorities have loosened COVID-19 restrictions in light of falling infections and higher vaccination numbers.
The bounce-back from lockdown is driving the largest upward leap in retail conditions seen since German reunification more than three decades ago, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
Despite concerns about supply bottlenecks, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Tuesday a global chip shortage that is hitting carmakers will not impact its forecasts for 2021 operating profit margins.
""Fortunately, been we have able to notably limit the negative impact on our customers and thus on delivery figures so far, for example by selling off inventories and other measures,"" a spokesperson for the company said.
Ifo's Wohlrabe said the economy would grow by 1.3% in the second quarter, and by a further 3.6% in the following quarter, with bottlenecks and rising input costs pushing many companies to raise prices.
Even in hospitality, among the sectors worst-hit by lockdown, where conditions were still bad, there was growing optimism, he added.
Thomas Gitzel, economist at VP Bank Group, said the economy is ""currently in excellent shape"".

""However, the pandemic is still not completely eliminated as an economic stumbling block. The Delta variant worries not only virologists but also economists,"" he added.
The share of COVID-19 infections caused by the more easily transmitted Delta variant of the coronavirus has doubled in Germany in a week and is likely to gain more traction over other variants, the Robert Koch Institute public health agency said on Wednesday.

Investing.com -- German business confidence hit its highest level since the end of 2018 in June. as the gradual relaxation of pandemic restrictions supported both current activity and expectations for the future.Ifo, the Munich-based think-tank, said its closely-watched business climate index rose to 104.0, from 102.9 in May. Analysts had expected a more modest increase to 103.6. Ifo economists said that conditions in the retail sector were improving at their fastest rate since reunification back in 1990 - a reflection of the lifting of restrictions on many German retailers as the incidence of Covid-19 in Europe's largest economy receded.
Germany's economy is typically the engine of growth for the broader Eurozone economy, which is showing signs of an increasingly broad and robust recovery as vaccination rates improve.. The IHS Markit composite PMI for the Eurozone, a real-time proxy for economic growth, hit a record high in June, according to preliminary estimates released on Wednesday.
""The reopening of the economy on the back of a still accelerating vaccination rollout has clearly boosted optimism and seems to be outweighing any concerns stemming from supply chain disruptions,"" ING analyst Carsten Brzeski said in a note to clients. ""The potential spillovers from US fiscal stimulus, the implementation of the European Recovery Fund in the second half of the year, a rebound in the construction sector and the fact that the manufacturing sector still has not reached pre-crisis levels, all signal that the only way is up for the German economy.""
Earlier Thursday, the Eurozone's second-largest economy France had reported a similar rise in its INSEE business confidence index to 107. That rise was, however, less sharp than forecast. "
159,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 03:31PM ET</span>",U.S. new home sales hit one-year low; prices soar,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a one-year low in May as the median price of newly built houses soared amid expensive raw materials, including framing lumber.
The second straight monthly decline in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was the latest indication that the tailwind from the COVID-19 pandemic could be subsiding. Single-family housing benefited from a migration from cities as millions of Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling during the pandemic.
""New home sales along with existing home sales suggest home buying activity is past its peak,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""We don't know what is going to happen when the stay-at-home economy shifts to going back to the office.""
New home sales dropped 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 769,000 units last month, the lowest level since May 2020. April's sales pace was revised down to 817,000 units from the previously reported 863,000 units. 
New home sales are considered a leading housing market indicator as they are recorded when contracts are signed. Last month's decline was concentrated in the populous South, where sales tumbled 14.5%. Sales, however, rose in the Northeast and West. They were unchanged in the Midwest.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for a small share of U.S. home sales, would be at a rate of 870,000 units in May. 
New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales rose 9.2% on a year-on-year basis in May. The median new house price jumped 18.1% from a year earlier to $374,400 in May. 
U.S. stocks were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
INVENTORY SQUEEZE
The market for new homes is being supported by a dearth of previously owned houses. At least 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, allowing the economy to begin reopening and companies to recall workers back to offices. A report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed sales of previously owned homes fell for a fourth straight month in May.
Builders have failed to take advantage of the inventory squeeze because of shortages of lumber and other raw materials. Exorbitant prices for raw materials are significantly raising the prices of newly built homes. At the same time, the supply gap is boosting competition for available homes, threatening to sideline some first-time buyers from the market. 
The supply-side constraints were also underscored by a separate survey from data firm IHS Markit on Wednesday showing manufacturers struggling to source raw materials this month.

New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 2% of transactions last month.
There were 330,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 315,000 in April. At May's sales pace it would take 5.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.6 months in April. About 76% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

160,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity index rises to record high in June - Markit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. factory activity climbed to a record high in June, but manufacturers are still struggling to secure raw materials and qualified workers, substantially raising prices for both businesses and consumers.
Data firm IHS Markit said on Wednesday its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI rose to a reading of 62.6 this month. That was the highest since the survey was expanded to cover all manufacturing industries in October 2009 and followed a final reading of 62.1 in May. 
The survey was conducted between June 10 and June 22. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index slipping to 61.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
The strength in manufacturing bolsters economists' expectations for double-digit growth in the second quarter. Demand shifted to goods from services as the COVID-19 pandemic kept Americans at home and is remaining robust even as vaccinations and trillions of dollars in relief money from the government allow the economy to reopen more broadly. 
But supply is struggling to cope with the demand surge, leading to huge backlogs of uncompleted work as well as sky-rocketing prices for raw materials and finished products, which are feeding into higher inflation.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that inflation has ""increased notably in recent months,"" which he attributed in part to the supply bottlenecks and the rebound in spending as the economy continues to reopen. Powell expressed optimism that inflation will subside ""as these transitory supply effects abate.""
IHS Markit said ""average supplier delivery times lengthened to the greatest extent on record."" 
The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers rose to the highest level since the series started. It said ""firms raised their selling prices at a quicker rate in an effort to pass on these higher costs."" 
The survey's new orders measure slipped, noting also that ""firms struggled to find staff or entice workers back to employment.""
Though IHS Markit's flash services sector PMI dropped to 64.8 from a reading of 70.4 in May, it was still the second highest since data collection began in October 2009.
Businesses in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, worried about rising inflation and the inability to find qualified labor and people willing to work. 

There are a record 9.3 million job openings. About 9.3 million people are classified as officially unemployed. 
With services activity moderating, overall business activity cooled this month. The survey's flash composite PMI output index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to 63.9 from a final reading of 68.7 in May.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 10:43AM ET</span>",U.S. current account deficit rises to 14-year high in the first quarter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. current account deficit increased to a 14-year high in the first quarter as an acceleration in economic growth drew in imports, and the gap could remain wide, with the United States leading the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, rose 11.8% to $195.7 billion last quarter. That was the largest shortfall since the first quarter of 2007.
Data for the fourth quarter was revised to show a $175.1 billion gap, instead of $188.5 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account gap widening to $206.8 billion in the January-March quarter.
The current account gap represented 3.5% of gross domestic product last quarter. That was up from 3.3% in the fourth quarter and the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
Still, the deficit remains below a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the United States is now a net exporter of crude oil and fuel.
The wider deficit is likely not an issue for the United States because of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. The economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter. Growth this year is expected to top 7%. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Imports of goods jumped $39.9 billion to a record $677.0 billion in the first quarter. Vaccinations against COVID-19 and trillions of dollars in pandemic relief are allowing for a greater reopening of the economy, unleashing pent-up demand, which is being partially satiated with imports. 
Exports of goods rose $24.5 billion to $408.6 billion last quarter. The increases in both exports and imports reflected increases in nearly all major categories, led by industrial supplies and materials, primarily petroleum and products.
Imports of services increased $1.8 billion to $120.2 billion, mostly reflecting a rise in sea freight transport. Exports of services increased $1.1 billion to $175.9 billion, led by personal travel.
Primary income receipts increased $9.6 billion to $261.7 billion, lifted by a rise in direct investment income, mostly earnings. Payments of primary income increased $13.5 billion to
$211.4 billion, driven by gains in earnings and portfolio

investment income, mostly interest on long-term debt securities.
Secondary income receipts rose $1.6 billion to $42.6 billion. They were boosted by increase in general government transfers, primarily public sector fines and penalties.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales plunged in April and May, as shops and other businesses were shuttered amid a third wave of COVID-19 infections, Statistics Canada data showed on Wednesday.
Retail trade fell 5.7% in April, the sharpest decline in a year, missing analyst forecasts of a 5.0% drop. In a preliminary estimate, Statscan said May retail sales likely fell by 3.2% as store closures dragged on.
""April showers brought no May flowers for Canadian retailers this year,"" Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, said in a note.
Statscan said that 5.0% of retailers were closed at some point in April. The average length of the closure was one day, it said, citing respondent feedback. 
Sales decreased in nine of the 11 subsectors, while core sales, which exclude gasoline stations and motor vehicles, were down 7.6% in April.
Clothing and accessory store sales fell 28.6%, with sales at building material and garden equipment stores falling for the first time in nine months, by 10.4%.
""These results continue to suggest that the Bank of Canada is too optimistic on the growth outlook for the second quarter, even if there is a solid rebound occurring now in June,"" Mendes said.

The central bank said in April that it expects Canada's economy to grow 6.5% in 2021 and signaled interest rates could begin to rise in the second half of 2022.
The Canadian dollar held on to earlier gains after the data, trading up 0.3% at 1.2271 to the greenback, or 81.49 U.S. cents.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>",UK inflation pressures mount as bounce-back slows only slightly -PMI,"By William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) -Inflation pressures faced by British firms hit record levels this month, and growth in the private sector cooled only slightly from an all-time high in May when coronavirus restrictions were lifted, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The preliminary reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) pointed to one of the strongest monthly improvements in business activity since 1998, with a reading of 61.7 - not far off May's unprecedented 62.9.
Input costs matched a previous record increase from June 2008 and prices charged by firms rose by the largest amount since these records began in 1999, as disruption to supply chains caused a scramble for components.
Inflation faced by consumers could now have a lot further to rise after breaking above the Bank of England's 2% target last month, said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The BoE is not expected to change monetary policy when it announces the outcome of its June policy meeting on Thursday but investors are waiting to hear whether it is sticking to its view that the rise in inflation is likely to prove transient.
Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said the PMI showed the private sector was struggling to keep up with the vaccine-driven rebound in demand.
""Today's data will strengthen the conviction of those on the Monetary Policy Committee who believe that extraordinary levels of policy support are no longer warranted,"" he said.
But Samuel Tombs, at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said an expected rise in unemployment as the government's job protection scheme winds down over the next three months, and an easing of COVID-19 bottleneck pressures on prices, meant the BoE would probably not be swayed by short-term inflation signals.
BREXIT EFFECT
Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed bars, restaurants and other hospitality firms in England to resume indoor service in mid-May. But last week he delayed the removal of the last social-distancing rules after COVID-19 cases rose again.
There were signs in the PMI survey that the rebound might be slowing as new orders cooled and manufacturers also felt the effects of Brexit after Britain left the European Union's single market on Jan. 1.
Tombs said British manufacturers' export orders undershot those of their euro zone peers for the sixth consecutive month, and by a larger margin than in May.
The PMI survey showed hiring rose by a record amount in June but many firms were unable to operate at full capacity because of staff shortages. The lack of candidates also pushed up wages.
Williamson said that could add to worries that the recent spike in inflation will last longer than the BoE has suggested.

The PMI for the services sector dipped to 61.7 in June from 62.9 in May. The index for the smaller manufacturing sector fell to 64.2 from 65.6.
Sentiment about the economic outlook, while still positive, fell to its lowest in five months.

164,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Euro zone business growth at 15-year high as demand unleashed -PMI,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in 15 years in June as the easing of lockdown measures unleashed pent-up demand and drove a boom in the dominant services sector but also led to soaring price pressures, a survey found.
When the coronavirus was spreading rapidly, governments imposed strict restrictions, encouraging citizens to stay at home and forcing much of the service industry to close.
But after a slow start the region's vaccination drive is picking up pace and the burden on health services has eased, allowing some restrictions placed on services firms - which were already adapting to new operating conditions - to be lifted.
That led to a jump in IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to economic health, to 59.2 from 57.1, its highest reading since June 2006. It was ahead of the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and a Reuters poll estimate for 58.8.
""Accelerated vaccine rollouts and falling case numbers are allowing restrictions to be eased and consumers to feel more confident,"" said Willem Sels, chief investment officer, Private Banking and Wealth Management at HSBC. 
""Services, and consumption in particular, are seeing strong momentum and are now the number one engine of European economic growth.""
A flash services PMI bounced to 58.0 from 55.2, its highest since January 2018 and above the 57.8 Reuters poll prediction. Suggesting that momentum would continue, the new business index climbed to a near 14-year high of 57.7 from 56.6.
The latest easing of restrictions in Germany and France, the bloc's two biggest economies and the only ones to report flash PMIs, led to a boom in services there as well.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, growth in the private sector cooled only slightly from an all-time high in May when more coronavirus restrictions were lifted.
PRICING PRESSURES
The expansion in euro zone manufacturing activity meanwhile matched May's blistering record pace, with the June flash PMI estimate holding steady from May's final reading of 63.1, confounding the Reuters poll estimate for a dip to 62.1. 
An index measuring output which feeds into the Composite PMI nudged up to 62.4 from 62.2.
But supply side disruptions and huge demand have made it a sellers' market for the raw materials factories need. The manufacturing input prices index rose to 88.0 from 87.1, the highest since the survey began in June 1997.
""Inflation pressures continued to mount as input prices soared in June,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
""The problem with these surveys is that they measure the number of businesses that indicate higher prices, not the extent of it. In this reopening phase, that might overstate expectations of the pace of inflation.""

The European Central Bank is likely to look through those inflationary pressures and will keep monetary policy loose this year to offer support to the economy, a Reuters poll found earlier this month. [ECILT/EU]
Amid hopes the worst of the pandemic is behind the bloc, overall optimism rose to its highest since IHS Markit began collecting the data in July 2012. The composite future output index rose to 71.6 from 70.6.

165,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2021 04:50AM ET</span>",Swedish government sees faster growth as pandemic effects fade,"By Johan Ahlander and Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's economy will grow substantially faster than previously expected this year, as it bounces back from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government said on Wednesday. 
The hit to Sweden's economy from the pandemic has turned out to be milder than first feared in 2020, when GDP shrank 2.8%.
The recovery has also been quicker, despite concerns over shortages of input goods and transport bottlenecks that have hit the export sector.
""We can revise up growth for this year,"" Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference. ""We had the strongest growth in the Nordic region in the first quarter. The labour market is strengthening and government finances are improving.""
However, Andersson warned that the current political uncertainty could damage prospects. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven lost a vote of no-confidence in parliament on Monday and has a week to decide whether to resign or call a snap election.
""It is clear that political uncertainty can have an adverse effect,"" Andersson said. ""It is clear that there is a risk.""
The centre-left and centre-right blocs in parliament are evenly balanced with no clear alternative to Lofven's minority coalition of the Social Democrats and Greens. Opinion polls suggest little would be changed by a new election.
VOLUNTARY MEASURES
Sweden's strong economic performance through the pandemic has, in part, been due to a response based more on voluntary measures focused on social distancing, than the kind of strict lockdowns adopted across much of the continent. 
But its heavy reliance on industry, with a smaller services sector, has also helped.
The government said gross domestic product would expand 4.7% in 2021 against 3.2% growth predicted in the previous forecast, made in April. Andersson said she did not see signs of overheating.
In 2022, growth is seen slowing to 2.9%, versus a previous forecast of 3.8% growth as a result of the quicker recovery this year.
In a separate forecast, the National Institute of Economic Research, a leading think-tank, said it saw growth this year of 4.4%.
The government has pumped more than 400 billion crowns ($47.19 billion) into the economy in measures such as furlough schemes to see it through the pandemic.
However, Sweden's finances remain strong with debt expected to be around 38% of GDP this year against around 90% across the European Union.

The government's forecast showed public finances running a deficit of 2.2% of GDP this year, compared with the previous forecast of a deficit of 4.5%. Finances should be balanced again by next year, the government said.

Activity for the private sector as a whole contracted for a second straight month due to the weaker reading for manufacturing and continued shrinking in the services sector, clouding the outlook for second-quarter economic growth in the country.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.5 in June from a final 53.0 in the previous month, largely due to a sharp decline in output.
Output shrank at the quickest rate since last November, the PMI survey showed, underscoring the pressure Japanese firms were facing from restrictions put in place in response to the health crisis.
""Flash PMI data signalled a quicker deterioration in business activity,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
Manufacturers faced disruptions to operating conditions from ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and supply chain pressures, according to Bhatti.
Overall orders and export orders expanded, but at a weaker pace than in the previous month, the survey showed.
But manufacturers' optimism for the year ahead stayed largely intact on hopes that Japan's delayed vaccine roll-out would lead to an easing of coronavirus restrictions and fuel an economic recovery.
The survey also highlighted severe conditions in the services sector, which saw activity contract for the 17th straight month, though at a slightly slower pace.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI index rose to a seasonally adjusted 47.2 from the previous month's final of 46.5.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, fell to 47.8 from May's final of 48.8.

The Recruitment & Employment Confederation's measure of business confidence surged by 21 percentage points to a net reading of +11.
That was the highest level since July 2016, shortly after Britain voted to leave the European Union, and the first time the index was in positive territory since 2018.
""This surge in employers' confidence in the UK economy is remarkable,"" Neil Carberry, REC chief executive, said.
""However, we are seeing labour and skills shortages across the economy right now, which the pandemic has made worse. These could threaten to slow down the recovery if not addressed quickly,"" he said. Better access to training was needed, as was support for staff wanting to change sectors, he added.
Britain's economy has shown signs of a strong recovery from its slump of nearly 10% in 2020, although the Bank of England thinks it will only regain its pre-pandemic size in the final quarter of this year.

REC said employers' confidence about hiring and investment was the highest since March 2016 at +29.
The data was based on telephone polling of 600 employers between March 8 and May 28.

In the second straight month of double-digit growth in borrowings, more companies lined up for new loans, leases and lines of credit compared with last year, but borrowings in May fell 17% from the previous month. 
""While overall industry performance is relatively strong during the first half of this year, even more robust demand for financing is being constrained by supply chain shortages in several economic subsectors,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said in a statement on Tuesday.

169,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2021 02:01PM ET</span>","Record-high U.S. house prices, tight supply weigh on sales","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell for a fourth straight month in May as record-high prices amid low inventory frustrated potential buyers, a trend that could persist for a while, with builders unable to deliver more houses because of expensive lumber.
The decline in sales reported by the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday was concentrated in the single-family housing segment, which benefited from a migration from cities as millions of Americans sought more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sales are retreating back to their pre-pandemic levels, indicating that the tailwind from the virus is diminishing. 
""It's becoming clear that record-high price growth and an enduring shortage of available homes are beginning to hinder would-be homebuyers,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. ""Sales volume continues to struggle to regain the momentum it built late last year.""
Existing home sales dropped 0.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.80 million units last month. Sales fell in the Northeast, West and the densely populated South. They, however, rose in the Midwest, which is generally considered as having more affordable homes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall to a rate of 5.72 million units in May. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 44.6% on a year-on-year basis. The annual increase was, however, distorted by the plunge in sales in May 2020, when the economy was reeling from mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
The median existing house price accelerated a record 23.6% from a year ago to an all-time high of $350,300 in May, with sales remaining skewed towards bigger and more expensive homes.
U.S. stocks were mostly higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
BIDDING WARS 
Single-family home sales, the largest segment of the housing market, dropped 1.0% to a pace of 5.08 million units, the lowest since last June. Sales of multi-family homes were unchanged, though they continue to rebound as more people return to cities.
At least 150 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing the economy to begin reopening and companies to recall workers back to offices.
""The pandemic-driven tailwind home sales have enjoyed appears to be lessening,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Much of the speculation about how many workers would work remotely indefinitely appear to have been greatly exaggerated."" 
Housing supply was already tight before the pandemic. With the public health situation brightening, there is cautious optimism that inventory will improve. Some homeowners were reluctant to list their homes because of fear of contracting the virus from potential buyers touring their properties. Some elderly Americans likely delayed downsizing due to the pandemic.
Economists are also hopeful that higher prices will entice some owners to put their homes on the market.
There were 1.23 million previously owned homes available for sale in May, up 7.0% from April and down 20.6% from one year ago. While the monthly improvement in inventory is welcome, the supply gap could take a long time to close.
The pandemic has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials. Though lumber prices have eased from recent record highs, they remain exorbitant, limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes. The government last week reported a moderate rebound in homebuilding in May and a drop in permits.
""A lack of availability and affordability concerns will likely be headwinds until supply constraints ease,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
That has led some economists to expect that housing would be a drag on gross domestic product growth in the second quarter after hefty contributions since the third quarter of 2020.
At May's sales pace, it would take 2.5 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.6 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Properties typically remained on the market for only 17 days in May, down from 26 days a year ago. 
There are widespread bidding wars, with institutional buyers reported to be outbidding other buyers. First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in May, down from 34% a year ago.

All-cash sales made up 23% of transactions, up from 17% last May.
Economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the price surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis. But the rapidly rising prices could feed inflation.

The Confederation of British Industry's monthly index for industrial output growth over the past three months was the highest since the CBI records began in 1975 at +37, helped by the lifting of coronavirus restrictions.
The CBI's orders balance - measuring the difference between the proportion of employers who say order levels are above or below normal - hit +19 in June from +17 in May, its highest since 1988.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of +18.

""However, supply shortages continue to bite, and firms expect that to push through into prices in the months ahead.""

rose by 0.8% compared with a month before, the biggest rise for the time of year since 2015, as available housing remains in short supply, property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said on Monday.
The increase is less than the 1.8% recorded a month earlier but still takes asking prices 7.5% above their level in early March 2020, before Britain went into its first COVID lockdown.
""Buyer demand remains very strong, though with an all-time low in the number of properties available for sale ... and new stock at higher-than-ever average prices, there are early signs of a slowing in the frenetic pace,"" Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said.
Rightmove, which says it advertises 95% of homes for sale in Britain, collected the data between May 9 and June 12.
British house prices surged last year despite the pandemic as many richer households sought more space to work from home, and the government cut property purchase taxes to reverse an initial slump in sales early in the pandemic.
June is the last month when the full stamp duty tax break applies, before it is wholly phased out in October.
Britain's official measure of house prices, based on completed transactions, showed prices in the year to April rose 8.9%, after a 9.9% increase for the year to March.
Rightmove said the most expensive homes were seeing the biggest percentage increases in asking prices. Typically these were detached houses with at least four bedrooms whose buyers were less stretched for cash.
London has seen weaker prices and demand than other parts of Britain, due to a fall in the number of foreign buyers and less need for many high-paid workers to commute to city-centre jobs.

Separate figures from property data company LonRes showed prices were 1.9% lower in expensive parts of the capital than a year ago. The number of new listings in central London was 33% higher in May than two years before. 
""Demand is not outstripping supply in most areas of prime London. Estate agents' windows have, for the most part, stayed well stocked, meaning prices have not seen the rapid growth experienced in other parts of the country,"" LonRes's head of research, Marcus Dixon, said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales fell unexpectedly last month as a lifting of lockdown restrictions encouraged spending in restaurants rather than shops, according to official data.
Retail sales fell 1.4% between April and May, the Office for National Statistics said.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to an 1.6% month-on-month increase in retail sales volumes for May. Only three of 19 forecasts showed a fall.
Food stores suffered the biggest hit, with a 5.7% drop in sales. Separately on Friday supermarket chain Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Britain's biggest retailer, reported a sharp slowdown in underlying UK sales growth in its first quarter.
""Anecdotal evidence suggests the easing of hospitality restrictions had an impact on sales as people returned to eating and drinking at locations such as restaurants and bars,"" the ONS said.
Most economists said the weak retail sales data was not necessarily suggestive of weaker consumer spending as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, since hospitality businesses have reported booming trade.
But Samuel Tombs, at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said more recent payment card data suggested that the surge in consumer spending could be losing steam.
""Households' real disposable income looks set to fall in Q4, as the end of the furlough scheme reduces employment and inflation rises to match wage growth,"" he said.
The rapid advance of the ""delta"" variant of COVID-19, despite Britain's swift roll-out of vaccines, could also crimp household spending in the weeks ahead.
An end to lockdown in England that had been scheduled for Monday has been delayed for four weeks.
In annual terms, retail sales were 24.6% higher than May last year, short of the median expectation for a 29.0% increase.
Household good stores bucked the wider decline with month-on-month growth of 9.0%, which the ONS linked to spending on outdoor goods.

Earlier this week, motoring and outdoor goods store Halfords said it had been doing a roaring trade in bicycles.

Other data next week is expected to show the Tokyo-area consumer price index (CPI) fell again in June as slow consumer demand amid the coronavirus pandemic caused a further easing of prices.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey was expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment rose to plus 15 from plus 5 in March, the poll of 16 economists showed.
An increase would mark the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement.
""Large manufacturers are expected to see corporate profits improve as the yen remains on a depreciating trend, and are supported by steadily increasing conditions in exports due to a recovery in overseas economies,"" analysts at the Japan Research Institute wrote.
The mood among big non-manufacturers was also likely to improve, turning positive for the first time since the first quarter of last year, the poll showed.
But big non-manufacturers' sentiment was still expected to remain more subdued than that of manufacturers, likely coming in at plus 3 from minus 1 in March.
The forecasts suggested firms are shaking off more of the drag from the coronavirus pandemic, but it continues to weigh heavily on non-manufacturers.
After contracting in January-March, Japan's economy is expected to grow at a much slower pace than other major economies such as the United States in the second quarter, in part due to anti-virus measures and a late vaccine rollout.
For the three months ahead, big manufacturers' optimism was expected to improve at a slower pace, likely rising to plus 18, the poll showed.
The big non-manufacturers' outlook index was seen rising to plus 8, it showed.
Big firms will likely raise their capital spending plans by 7.2% for the current fiscal year as the outlook improves.
The BOJ will announce the tankan quarterly survey results at 8:50 a.m. on July 1.

The BOJ on Friday maintained its massive stimulus, while it also said it will launch a new scheme to encourage financial institutions to boost lending and investment for fighting climate change.
Separate data from the internal ministry due out on June 25 is expected to show Tokyo-area core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include oil products, fell 0.1% in June from a year earlier, the poll found.

Consumer prices excluding fresh food ticked up 0.1% compared with a year earlier, lifted by a 20% jump in gas prices, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Economists had predicted flat prices overall.
While even the smallest uptick in inflation is likely to be seen positively by the Bank of Japan, price momentum is still far more subdued than in the U.S. and other countries where central banks are starting to project possible rate increases. The BOJ forecasts inflation staying below its 2% target for the foreseeable future, meaning its main stimulus will probably stay in place for years to come.

The index, which tracks repeat sales of single-family homes in 11 major Canadian markets, rose 2.8% on the month in May, led by strong month-over-month gains in the Ottawa-Gatineau capital region, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and in Hamilton, Ontario.
""It was a third consecutive month in which all 11 markets of the composite index were up from the month before,"" said Daren King, an economist at National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF), in a note.
On an annual basis, the Teranet index was up 13.7% from a year earlier, the 10th consecutive acceleration and the strongest 12-month gain since July 2017. 
Halifax led the year-over-year gains, up 29.9%, followed by Hamilton at 25.5% and Ottawa-Gatineau at 22.8%.
Housing price gains in smaller cities outside Toronto and its immediate suburbs again outpaced the major urban centers, with Barrie, Ontario leading the pack, up 31.4%.
On a month-over-month basis, prices rose 4.9% in Ottawa-Gatineau, 4.3% in Halifax and 3.7% in Hamilton.

The Teranet index measures price gains based on the change between the two most recent sales of properties that have been sold at least twice.

A breakdown of the figures showed that secondary activities, which include manufacturing, were up by 36.4% from May 2020. Meanwhile tertiary activities, which encompass the service sector, expanded by 19.8% over the same period.
If the preliminary estimate is confirmed, May's activity was only about 0.4% behind the level reached in February 2020, the last full month before pandemic-related restrictions began to hit the economy, according to an index compiled by INEGI.
INEGI noted that April's data had been revised up to show growth of some 21.6% from the same month in 2020, one percentage point higher than the previous estimate.
The agency also said the preliminary figures pointed to month-on-month economic growth of 0.5% between April and May.

The coronavirus pandemic hit the Mexican economy hard last year, reducing gross domestic product by some 8.5%. In 2021, the finance ministry says the economy could grow by 6.5%, recouping much of the ground lost.
Robust export activity has helped to drive the recovery, which has benefited from massive economic stimulus spending in the United States, Mexico's top trade partner.

The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 30.7 from 31.5 in May. That was just shy of economists' expectations for a reading of 31.0, according to a Reuters poll.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, next due out July 1.
Factories have struggled to keep up with demand in recent months as the economy shows signs of emerging from the COVID-19 recession and consumers flush with cash from recent stimulus programs ramp up spending. In March, the Philly Fed's factory activity gauge hit its highest level since April 1973.

The bank's employment index increased to 30.7 from 19.3 in May.

Even with the increase in claims, which have been volatile during the pandemic, layoffs have declined significantly in recent months as health concerns ebb and businesses ramp up hiring. Economists forecast continued improvement in the labor market through the end of the year, with an expectation that the unemployment rate will fall below 5% by the end of the fourth quarter.
Federal Reserve officials are watching for signs that employment is “inclusive and broad-based.” At the conclusion of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting Wednesday, Chair Jerome Powell said the pace of improvement in the labor market has been uneven.
“Factors related to the pandemic, such as care-giving needs, ongoing fears of the virus, and unemployment insurance payments appear to be weighing on employment growth,” Powell said. “These factors should wane in coming months, against a backdrop of rising vaccinations, leading to more rapid gains in employment.”

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat confirmed inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.3% month- on-month for a 2.0% year-on-year increase, as estimated earlier. The ECB wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2%.
Energy prices added 1.19 percentage point to the overall year-on-year figure and services 0.45 point, while food, alcohol and tobacco added 0.15 point.
Without the most volatile components of energy and food, or what the ECB calls core inflation, prices rose 0.2% on the month and only 0.9% year-on-year.

Economists expect inflation may be even higher late in the year, coming closer to 2.5% as the recovery from a pandemic-induced double-dip recession and recent commodity price increases add to price pressures.
But the ECB believes the surge in inflation is temporary and has vowed to keep its monetary policy loose because the drivers of price growth will fade early next year and inflation will be below target for years to come.

Average new home prices in 70 major cities grew 0.6% in May, unchanged from April, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.
On a year-on-year basis, new home prices rose 4.9%, slightly faster than a 4.8% rise in April.
Real estate, a vital source of growth for China's economy, has bounced back quickly from the COVID-19 crisis. But a relentless rise in home prices, particularly in big cities, has raised concerns about overheating and prompted the government to ramp up efforts to cool the red-hot market this year.
""The new home price growth has peaked,"" said Li Yujia, chief economist at Guangdong Property Policy Research Institute. 
""It is due to local government's price caps, and sales discounts offered by many developers who are in debt repayment peak season and under stringent scrutiny on debt ratios."" 
Chinese property prices have risen rapidly this year, even as the government took a series of measures to cool the market including stricter rules for home buyers, curbing debt accumulation by developers and guiding banks to increase mortgage rates.
The NBS data showed 62 cities reported monthly gains in May, with the number unchanged from the tally in April.
New home prices quickened slightly in tier-1 cities, while growth flatlined in tier-2 and 3 cities.
Second-hand home prices in Shenzhen, the front runner amid the rampant property boom, fell 0.1% month-on-month in May. Zhang Dawei, chief analyst with property agency Centaline, said it was the first monthly fall in nearly two years.
Li expected new home price growth to remain elevated as land prices stay high, although developers are likely to ramp up price discounts to promote sales.
""The growth is expected to soften at the end of (the) third quarter if current policy tightenings remain in place.""

Earlier this week, data showed China's real estate investment rose in May at its weakest clip this year as policy tightening on developers' financing and mortgages gradually kicked in, although growth stayed resilient.
China's home prices are expected to grow 5% this year, according to a Reuters poll of analysts in June, up from a forecast for a 3.3% gain in a similar survey in February.

Thursday's data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed 115,200 net new jobs were created in May, far above forecasts for a 30,000 gain. Full-time jobs jumped by 97,500 and hours worked rose sharply, pointing to expanding output.
Unemployment dropped to 5.1%, from 5.5% in April, a remarkable recovery from a high of 7.5% hit last July when coronavirus lockdowns tipped the economy into recession.
Such strength will be warmly welcomed by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), but also challenges the bank's belief that it will be years before the labour market is tight enough to drive wages and inflation sustainably higher.
The RBA has been the odd man out as other rich world central banks turn more hawkish, notably the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand.
""In light of the recent shift in rhetoric overseas the RBA appears incredibly dovish, particularly given the relative strength of the economy,"" said Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at CBA.
The surprise jobs data came just after RBA Governor Philip Lowe argued that wages would remain subdued for some time, in part due to a widespread focus on cost cutting by firms.
Firms were using non-wage strategies to retain and attract staff, or even choosing to ration output instead, Lowe said in a speech delivered earlier on Thursday.
As a result, the RBA had signalled it would not raise the 0.1% cash rate until inflation was back in its 2-3% target band and that was unlikely until 2024.
Yet the May data showed unemployment already down at 5.1%, when the RBA had not expected to reach 5% until the end of this year. Lowe has said it could take a jobless rate of 4% or lower to push annual wage growth above 3% as desired.
The data added to the case for the RBA to scale back its bond yield target and asset buying programme at its July policy meeting, said Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics.

""We expect the RBA to announce a flexible asset purchase programme at its next meeting,"" Udy said.
""But if the labour market recovery holds up as we expect, the Bank may be making use of that flexibility by tapering asset purchases sooner than November as we had anticipated.""

184,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 10:18PM ET</span>",Australian Unemployment Tumbles to 5.1% in May as Jobs Surge,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s unemployment rate tumbled in May in response to a burst of hiring, led by full-time positions, underscoring the economy’s ongoing momentum supported by fiscal-monetary stimulus.
The jobless rate declined to 5.1% in April, well below economists’ estimate that it would remain unchanged at 5.5%, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Thursday in Sydney. The economy added 115,200 roles versus a forecast 30,000 gain, while the participation rate climbed to 66.2%.
The decline in the jobless rate is now back to the level in February 2020, said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS. “The declining unemployment rate continues to align with the strong increases in job vacancies,” he added.
The Australian dollar jumped 0.3% to the day’s high of 76.45 U.S. cents as some traders rushed to cover short positions, according to an Asia-based FX trader.
The yield on sovereign bonds that mature in November 2024 surged almost 12 basis points as investors bet that a more hawkish Federal Reserve and the stronger jobs data add to the case for the Reserve Bank of Australia to decide against rolling forward its yield control. The spread between April and November 2024 notes surged to over 30 basis points.
Australia has transitioned from recovery to expansion after recouping jobs and output lost during the pandemic. Thursday’s data suggests the economy has managed to absorb losses from the end of the government’s signature JobKeeper wage subsidy in late March.
Withdrawal Weathered
“The labor market has weathered the withdrawal of JobKeeper very well,” said Sean Langcake, a senior economist at BIS Oxford Economics. “The recovery took a pause in April following the last JobKeeper payments at the end of March. But there are no signs of lingering effects in today’s data. Participation is back around an all-time level.”
Both the RBA and Treasury expect employment will keep strengthening, based on job advertisements and other forward indicators. Yet there may also be some weaker readings ahead after Melbourne was forced back into a two-week lockdown to contain a Covid-19 outbreak.
Among other details in today’s report:
The RBA is due to decide in less than three weeks whether to roll over its three-year yield target bond to November 2024 from the current April 2024 and the scale of any further quantitative easing. Its current A$100 billion ($76 billion) tranche of QE is due to conclude in September.
The government has joined forces with the central bank in trying to push unemployment down toward 4% to spur wage growth and rekindle inflation. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced targeted additional fiscal support in his May budget to keep supporting the economy.
The RBA’s updated quarterly forecasts released last month show the jobless rate falling to 5% by the end of this year and 4.5% at the end of 2022. Under an optimistic scenario for unemployment, the rate could decline to 3.75% by mid-2023, the forecasts showed.
Australia’s containment of Covid has underpinned a recovery in sentiment that’s seen households spend and firms flag further investment. However, Melbourne’s lockdown did put a damper on the latest consumer confidence reading.
Yet business conditions -- which measures hiring, sales and profits, and is monitored by the RBA -- rose in May to a fresh record.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 09:55PM ET</span>","NZ economy surges as housing, retail drive post-COVID recovery","By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's economic growth swept past forecasts in the first quarter on the back of a housing boom and strong retail spending, avoiding a second recession and bringing forward expectations for tighter monetary policy.
Gross domestic product (GDP) rose 1.6% in the three months through to March, Statistics New Zealand said on Thursday, well ahead of a Reuters poll forecast of 0.5% growth and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) estimate of a 0.6% fall.
New Zealand's success in virtually eliminating the coronavirus in the country allowed it to reopen its domestic economy must before other advanced nations, boosting employment and consumer spending.
Westpac Bank said economic growth was estimated to be running at about 0.8% above levels prior to the global coronavirus outbreak.
The rapid recovery follows better than expected readings on key indicators like employment and retail spending in recent months that prompted the central bank to signal a move away from stimulatory monetary policy settings adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the first in the world to do so.
ANZ Bank said it was bringing forward its forecast for the central bank to hike its official cash rate to February 2022, saying ""a year from now feels too far away"".
""Q1 data confirm NZ's economic recovery has been spectacular relative to early-pandemic expectations. And while there are still pockets of weakness, they are getting hard to identify at the aggregate level,"" said ANZ Chief Economist Sharon Zollner.
The better than expected GDP figures pushed the Kiwi dollar up 0.3% to around $0.7073.
Growth was largely driven by a surging housing sector amid historically low interest rates and cheap mortgages, although worries about housing affordability have led the government and RBNZ to introduce measures to try to cool the market.
Finance Minister Grant Robertson said in a statement that confidence in the recovery also led to a boost in retail spending, dining out and holiday accommodation, offsetting the loss of overseas tourism, but he warned there were still uncertainties.
New Zealand's vaccine rollout has been slower than other nations, and the country's border are expected to remain closed until 2022.
The GDP bounce comes after New Zealand reported a 1.0% fall in economic growth in the final quarter of 2020.

The country had rebounded from recession with a revised 14.1% quarter-on-quarter GDP growth in the three months to end-September last year. That more than reversed an 11% drop in the preceding quarter as the country observed strict lockdown measures. 
Annual GDP rose 2.4% in the first quarter, Statistics New Zealand said, compared with analyst expectations for a 0.9% rise.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding rebounded less than expected in May as very expensive lumber and shortages of other materials continued to constrain builders' ability to take advantage of an acute shortage of houses on the market.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed permits for future home construction falling to a seven-month low. Housing completions also declined while the number of homes authorized for construction but not yet started rose to the highest level since 1999, indicating supply will likely remain tight for a while and boost house price inflation.
""Shortages of materials and labor have builders struggling to increase production of new homes, though the demand remains strong,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Potential home buyers should expect tight inventories and rising prices for both new and existing homes for the foreseeable future.""
Housing starts rose 3.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.572 million units last month. Data for April was revised down to a rate of 1.517 million units from the previously reported 1.569 million units. 
Groundbreaking activity rose in the Midwest, the West and the densely populated South, but fell in the Northeast.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts increasing to a rate of 1.630 million units. Last month's increase still left starts below March's rate of 1.725 million units, which was the highest level since June 2006. Housing starts, however, jumped 50.3% on a year-on-year basis in May.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, increased 4.2% to a rate of 1.098 million units. Starts for the volatile multi-family segment rose 2.4% to a pace of 474,000 units. 
(Graphics: Housing starts and building permits - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdvzxgemvw/hsbp.png) 
Softwood lumber prices increased a record 154.3% year-on-year in May, according to the latest producer price data. Lumber futures contracts have dropped from historic highs set in early May as sawmills ramped up production and imports increased. Still, prices remain very high.
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders fell to a 10-month low in June. 
The NAHB blamed the ebb in sentiment on ""higher costs and declining availability for softwood lumber and other building materials,"" noting that was driving up prices of new houses ""which has slowed the strong pace of homebuilding."" 
Copper is in short supply while tariffs on steel imports are also adding to building costs, which are boosting new home prices and contributing to higher inflation. Some appliances are also scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage. 
A separate report from the Labor Department on Wednesday showed import prices rising 1.1% in May. That lifted the year-on-year increase to 11.3%, the largest gain since September 2011, from 10.8% in April. 
(Graphics: Inflation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnvwmozjvw/inflation.png) 
""The U.S. is experiencing cost-push inflation, which historically has proven more temporary than other causes of inflation, primarily demand pull,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
DEMAND BOOM
Demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has left millions of Americans still working from home, is driving a housing market boom. The inventory of previously owned homes is near record lows. 
House prices have increased by the most in more than 15 years on an annual basis, raising concerns that some first-time buyers could be priced out of the market.
Permits for future homebuilding fell 3.0% to a rate of 1.681 million units in May. Building permits surged 34.9% compared to May 2020. They are running slightly ahead of starts, suggesting moderate gains in homebuilding in the months ahead.
The housing market has been the star performer in the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession, which started in February 2020. Residential construction investment has enjoyed double-digit growth since the third quarter of last year. Most economists expect housing will make a modest contribution to gross domestic product growth in the second quarter.
""New residential construction remains strong, but building material pricing and availability are likely to remain significant headwinds,"" said Charlie Dougherty, an economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Building permits for single-family homes fell 1.6% to a rate of 1.130 million units. The number of housing units authorized to be built but not started increased 0.8% to a rate of 238,000 at the end of May, the highest since the government started tracking the series in January 1999.
Building permits for multi-family housing projects dropped 5.8% to a rate of 551,000 units. The multi-family housing market is seen getting a lift from people returning to cities as the economy reopens amid an easing of the pandemic's grip.
Housing completions fell 4.1% to a rate of 1.368 million units last month. Single-family home completions dropped 2.6% to a rate of 978,000 units.

Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction rose 0.5% to a rate of 1.324 million units last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Business confidence levels of Japanese manufacturers and service sector firms were little changed in June from the prior month, highlighting the fragile and uneven state of the country's coronavirus recovery, a Reuters survey showed.
While manufacturers' mood remained positive thanks to strong overseas demand, it was forecast to be slightly lower three months from this month, according to the Reuters Tankan poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers edged up to 22 from 21 in May, while the mood in the service sector was more dour. The service index was flat, down from 2 the prior month, the poll conducted June 3-14 showed. (For a detailed table of the results, click)
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.
Among manufacturers, buoyant sentiment at chemical and metal product makers offset less favourable conditions in sectors such as textiles and paper, according to the survey of 481 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 238 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
""We're seeing a positive impact from growing overseas demand and in electronic materials-related industries,"" a manager at a chemical products maker said.
The poll comes a day before the BOJ is set to end a June 17-18 policy meeting where it may extend its pandemic-relief programmes to support the country's economic recovery, which would help solidify the view it will lag other central banks in cutting crisis-mode policies.
The BOJ's own ""tankan"" business survey is next due on July 1, weeks before Tokyo is set to host the Olympic Games later that month amid ongoing concerns the event could fuel a spike in COVID-19 infections.
Japan's economy is expected to narrowly avoid falling into recession this quarter, but is unlikely to see the sharp growth rates of the United States, largely due to extended coronavirus curbs and Tokyo's late vaccine rollout.
The Reuters Tankan survey also highlighted the hit that firms were feeling from the health crisis, with a manager at a wholesaler describing the recovery from the coronavirus blow as still being ""sluggish"".

Another manager, at a real estate firm, also remained negative. ""Demand in aviation continues to decline due to the impact of the coronavirus,"" the manager wrote in the survey.
Manufacturers' business confidence was seen a notch lower at 21 in September, while that of service-sector firms was expected to rise to 10, the survey showed.

Sunak said there was no sign that expectations for higher inflation were becoming entrenched as the economy bounces back from its coronavirus lockdowns.
""That's different to what's happening in the U.S. so I think actually here, people's expectation is inflation will remain at target over the medium term, but of course that's one of the many risks that it's my job to worry about,"" Sunak said in an interview with broadcaster GB News.
Earlier, official data showed Britain's consumer price index hit 2.1% in May. 
Sunak also told GB News there would be would be no return to austerity after his 350 billion pounds ($490 billion) of spending to see Britain's economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, he said he wanted to protect the country against shocks ahead and not leave Britain's debt to be paid for by future generations 
""(And) that does require a bit of focus and prioritisation,"" Sunak said.

Asked if the government will keep its promise to maintain its mechanism for increasing state pensions, which could mean rises that track fast-growing wages, Sunak said the issue would be reviewed in the autumn.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 01:46PM ET</span>",U.S. import prices accelerate in May; export prices surge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. import prices increased more than expected in May as the cost of petroleum products rose and supply chain bottlenecks boosted prices of other goods, adding to signs that inflation was heating up amid a reopening economy.
Import prices rose 1.1% last month after gaining a 0.8% in April, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. The seventh straight monthly gain lifted the year-on-year increase to 11.3%, the largest rise since September 2011. Import prices surged 10.8% on a year-on-year basis in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, rising 0.8%. Part of the acceleration in the year-on-year prices reflected the dropping of last spring's weak readings from the calculation.
Data this month showed strong increases in producer and consumer prices in May. Vaccinations against COVID-19, trillions of dollars from the government and record-low interest rates are whipping up demand, leaving companies scrambling for raw materials and labor. But the higher inflation is largely viewed as transitory, with supply chains expected to adjust.
Imported fuel prices jumped 4.0% last month after rising 1.6% in April. Petroleum prices increased 3.8%, while the cost of imported food fell 0.4%. Excluding fuel and food, import prices rose 1.0%. These so-called core import prices advanced 0.7% in April.
The report also showed export prices jumped 2.2% in May after rising 1.1% in April. Prices for agricultural exports rose 6.1%, the largest gain since in November 2010. 

Nonagricultural export prices rose 1.7%, lifted by industrial supplies and materials and consumer goods.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2021 09:11AM ET</span>","UK inflation hits 2.1%, vaults past Bank of England target","By William Schomberg and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation unexpectedly jumped above the Bank of England's target in May when it hit 2.1%, part of a post-lockdown climb in prices that is expected gather pace.
The acceleration of the consumer price index from April's 1.5% largely reflected how weak inflation was in May 2020 when the economy was reeling from its first tight lockdown.
The figure represented the first time inflation has gone above the BoE's 2% target in almost two years and was above all 33 forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists which had pointed to a rise in inflation to 1.8%.
Yields on British government bonds rose early on Wednesday with the yield on two-year gilts - which are sensitive to speculation about BoE policy moves - briefly touching their highest in nearly a month.
Investors around the world are assessing the risks of a sustained jump in prices, especially in the United States where annual inflation hit 5.0% in May, the highest in almost 13 years, and where President Joe Biden has proposed a $6 trillion stimulus package.
""Whether the upside news proves temporary or persistent, it is clearly a hawkish surprise,"" HSBC economist Chris Hare said. 
""Of course, some major uncertainties, such as the end of the furlough scheme in September, remain. But if the upside surprises continue, calls for a rate rise on the Monetary Policy Committee may grow louder.""
The CPI data showed fuel prices in May were almost 18% higher than a year earlier while clothing and footwear costs rose by 2.1% as people, emerging from their lockdown isolation, bought new outfits.
The price data was collected on or around May 11, before pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors and cinemas and hotels reopened from May 17. 
The BoE has said it expects inflation to hit 2.5% by the end of this year before settling back to its 2% target as the impact of post-lockdown energy price rises fades along with other cost pressures, such as bottlenecks in supply chains.
Previous surges in inflation since the 2008 financial crisis proved temporary, as the labour market was too weak to create the type of wage-price spirals which occurred in the 1970s.
The central bank is expected to leave policy unchanged on June 24 after its latest meeting.
SIX-MONTH SURGE
Jack Leslie, an economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the speeding up of price growth from 0.3% in November to 2.1% in May represented the fastest six-month rise since sterling collapsed after the 2008-09 financial crisis.
""But UK inflationary pressures are different - and nowhere as near as large - as those causing fierce debate in the U.S.,"" Leslie said.
Sterling rose slightly after the ONS figures.
Core inflation, which excludes the price of food, energy and other volatile items, rose to 2.0% in the 12 months to May from 1.3% in April, the Office for National Statistics said.
While BoE Governor Andrew Bailey and most of his colleagues say the climb in inflation will be temporary, Chief Economist Andy Haldane said last week the central bank faced the ""most dangerous moment"" since the European Exchange Rate Mechanism crisis in 1992.
There were signs of further price pressure ahead in Wednesday's data.

Prices paid by manufacturers for their inputs rose by 10.7% in the 12 months to May, the highest since September 2011, and the prices they charged rose by 4.6%, the biggest increase since January 2012.
House prices in April were 8.9% higher than a year before, slowing from a 9.9% rise in March which was the strongest increase since 2007. The ONS said April's dip reflected a rush of sales in March when buyers had been expecting the expiry of a cut in stamp duty which has since been extended.

While the COVID-19 pandemic briefly halted seven years of unbroken price growth last year, a second shutdown of construction earlier this year has compounded a long-standing mismatch between low supply and high demand.
Property prices outside of Dublin were 5.4% higher in April than a year before compared with growth of 3.5% in the capital, the data showed. Overall, prices are 14.3% below a peak hit in 2007 before the bursting of a property bubble.

BEIJING (Reuters) -Growth in China's factory output slowed for a third straight month in May, likely weighed down by disruptions caused by COVID-19 outbreaks in the country's southern export powerhouse of Guangdong.
Retail sales and investment growth also came in below market expectations, but analysts say underlying activity still looks quite solid, noting headline readings remain highly distorted by comparisons to the pandemic plunge early last year. 
The Chinese economy has largely shaken off the gloom from the coronavirus slump, but officials warn its recovery remains uneven amid challenges including soft domestic demand, rising raw material prices and global supply chain disruptions.
China's rapid recovery last year and a U.S. rebound this year have sharply boosted Asia's export-reliant economies -- Japan posted its strongest export growth in 41 years on Wednesday -- but resurgent COVID infections and lockdowns are holding back broader-based recoveries.
Chinese industrial production rose 8.8% in May from a year ago, slower than the 9.8% uptick in April, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Wednesday, missing a 9.0% on-year rise forecast by analysts from a Reuters poll.
In particular, the output of auto vehicles fell 4% from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 6.8% in April, crimped by a global chip shortage.
""This is a normal cyclical slowdown after an economic recovery. In a nutshell, we can see the economic rebound is peaking,"" said Hao Zhou, senior EM economist Asia, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
""The extent of the slowdown in the second half is key. So far, it's still normal and there's still room for the fiscal policy to play a part later in the year.""
Most analysts had expected some moderation in May output due to softer export orders, higher input costs for factories and tighter environmental restrictions on heavy industry.
Outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Pearl River Delta since late May also have brought some key ports to a standstill, economists at Nomura said in a note to clients, though it believes the current spate of infections can be contained in a relatively short period of time.
Fu Linghui, an NBS official, said external risks also remain, such as still rising global COVID-19 infections, an uneven recovery in the world economy and spill-over effects from large stimulus programmes from some countries.
BRIGHT SPOTS
Retail sales rose 12.4% year-on-year in May, weaker than 13.6% growth expected by analysts and down from the 17.7% jump seen in April.
Chinese consumer and business confidence has been picking up thanks to pent-up demand and quickening vaccine rollouts, which are also reviving domestic tourism.
Two-year average growth for retail sales stood at 4.5% in May, faster than the 4.3% in April, in a sign that sales are gradually rebounding, Fu from NBS told reporters.
Fixed asset investment increased 15.4% in the first five months from the same period a year earlier, versus a forecast 16.9% rise, slowing from January-April's 19.9% increase.
Notably, two-year average growth in manufacturing investment turned positive in May. 
""What is gratifying is some weak indicators such as consumption and manufacturing investments are showing some improvement,"" Li Huiyong, deputy general manager at Hwabao WP Fund Management Co., adding that he expects the trend to continue. 
China's unemployment rate also continued to drop. Nationwide urban jobless rate fell to 5.0% in May, the lowest since May 2019, from 5.1% in April.
On a month-on-month basis, Capital Economics estimated industrial output growth was unchanged at 0.5%, the pace of investment spending eased slightly and retail sales picked up.
However, Reuters calculations showed real estate investment 
in May rose at its slowest pace this year as more smaller towns joined bigger cities in trying to curb red-hot housing prices. New construction starts fell for a second month.
MIXED BAG?
Earlier data for May painted a somewhat mixed picture, with export growth easing but imports picking up, fuelled by surging demand and prices for raw materials.

Surging commodities prices pushed China's producer inflation to its highest level in over 12 years, squeezing profit margins for mid- and downstream firms.
Bank lending unexpectedly rose but broader credit growth continued to slow, a trend analysts said could start to weigh on activity in the second half of the year.

The lower growth forecast for Europe's largest economy represented a cut of 0.4 percentage points compared to its previous estimate from March, Ifo said.
For 2022, the institute raised its GDP growth forecast to 4.3% from 3.2% previously.
""In the short term, the bottlenecks in the delivery of primary products in particular are holding back the economy,"" Ifo economist Timo Wollmershaeuser said.
""The recovery, which is strong in itself due to the reopening of the economy, is being pushed back a bit further than we had expected in spring.""
Germany's Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Tuesday they are cutting working hours at some of their plants as carmakers continue to suffer from a shortage of semiconductors.
The recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply bottlenecks for chips, timber and other materials are pushing up prices, prompting Ifo to forecast inflation will jump to 2.6% this year from 0.6% in 2020 before easing back to 1.9% in 2022.
The strong rebound is likely to push up domestic demand and with it imports, which are forecast to surpass exports in 2021 and 2022.
This will help to reduce Germany's large current account surplus to 5.8% of economic output in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, bringing it below the European Union's indicative threshold of 6% for the first time in many years, the institute said.

Ifo's growth forecast is less optimistic than estimates from the Bundesbank, which predicts 3.7% for this year and 5.2% next year.
In contrast to the Bundesbank, the Ifo institute expects household spending to be less supportive as many consumers are unlikely to spend all the savings which they piled up during the lockdowns, Wollmershaeuser said.

Japan’s exports surged by nearly 50% from last year’s dismal level, as record jumps in shipments to the U.S. and Europe helped boost an economy still struggling with the virus at home.
The value of overseas shipments jumped 49.6% in May compared to a year earlier, when the world economy was suffering under pandemic lockdowns, according to finance ministry figures released Wednesday that were largely in line with the median forecast from analysts. It was the biggest gain since April 1980.
Shipments of cars and auto parts more than doubled, despite a shortage of semiconductors that has crimped vehicle production in the U.S. and other markets.
Still, economists warned that the data give an inflated view of the strength of Japan’s exports because they’re based on a comparison with 2020’s terrible figures, pointing out that the value of shipments was flat compared with April on a seasonally adjusted basis. Compared with 2019’s level, exports rose more than 7%.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports rose at the fastest pace since 1980 in May and a key gauge of capital spending grew, helping the world's third largest economy offset sluggish domestic demand as COVID-19 vaccinations boost business activity in key markets.
The jump in exports largely reflected a rebound in shipments from last year's pandemic-driven plunge, but was a welcome sign as the economy struggles to rebound from the first quarter's doldrums amid a prolonged coronavirus state of emergency.
The solid data will likely bolster the view that the central bank will stick with its ultra-easy policy at its June 17-18 policy meeting, although it may extend pandemic-relief programmes to back a fragile economic recovery. The government recently extended coronavirus emergency curbs in Tokyo and other major areas.
""We cannot count on private consumption, but an uptrend in exports and capital spending will help pick up the slack in the second quarter,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Still, export growth may lack strength as a global chip shortage will put a drag on car production over the next half year or so,"" he added.
Ministry of Finance data on Wednesday showed exports grew 49.6% year-on-year in May, versus a 51.3% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll, led by U.S.-bound car shipments.
The jump followed a 38% rise in April and marked the sharpest monthly increase since April 1980, when shipments surged 51.4%.
May's rise largely reflected the recoil effect of a 28.3% plunge in May of 2020.
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, grew 23.6%, led by chip production equipment, hybrid cars and scrap copper, the trade data showed.
Exports to the United States, another key market for Japanese goods, jumped 87.9% in May, a record for year-on-year growth according to comparable data going back to January 1980, driven by cars and auto parts.
Imports rose 27.9% year-on-year in May versus a median estimate for a 26.6% gain, resulting in a trade deficit of 187.1 billion yen ($1.70 billion), against the median estimate for a 91.2 billion yen shortfall.
Separate data by the Cabinet Office showed core machinery orders, which serve as a leading indicator of capital expenditure in the coming six to nine months, rose 0.6% in April from the previous month, below an expected 2.7% gain.
The Cabinet Office left its assessment on machinery orders unchanged, saying a pick-up was stalling.
A government official said solid overseas demand for chip manufacturing equipment helped support external orders, which jumped 46.2% in April, rebounding from a 53.9% fall in March.
Core orders, which exclude those for ships and electrical utilities, grew 6.5% year-on-year in April, versus an 8.0% gain expected by economists, the data showed.

The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its policy interest rate at minus 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% at its policy meeting this week.

196,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 03:36PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales take step back as spending pivots to services, trend remains strong","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales dropped more than expected in May, with spending rotating back to services from goods as vaccinations allow Americans to travel and engage in other activities that had been restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite last month's decline reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, the trend in retail sales remains strong. Sales in April were revised sharply up and are well above their pre-pandemic level, keeping intact expectations of double-digit growth in both consumer spending and the economy this quarter.
""The days of spending money online and splurging on durable goods and home furnishings is pivoting toward getting ready for trips to see grandma and grandpa at the lake or the beach and evenings out reconnecting with friends at bars and restaurants,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Retail sales fell 1.3% last month. Data for April was revised higher to show sales increasing 0.9% instead of being unchanged as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales declining 0.8%. 
Retail sales surged 28.1% on a year-on-year basis. The retail sales report mostly capture spending on goods, with restaurants and bars the only services category included. 
During the pandemic, demand shifted to goods like electronics and motor vehicles as millions of people worked from home, switched to online classes and avoided public transportation. More than half of eligible Americans are fully vaccinated, boosting demand for air travel, hotel accommodation, dining out and entertainment among other activities. 
May's decline in retail sales was also due to a drop in receipts at auto dealerships, reflecting tight supply as a global semiconductor shortage hampers motor vehicle production. 
Receipts at auto dealerships fell 3.7%. Shortages also likely hurt sales at electronics and appliance stores, which dropped 3.4%. Receipts at building material stores tumbled 5.9%. There were also declines in sales at furniture retailers as well as at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. 
Online retail sales slipped 0.8%. But sales at clothing stores rose 3.0%. Consumers also increased spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 1.8% rise in receipts. Sales at restaurants and bars are 70.6% higher compared to May 2020.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dropped 0.7% after a revised 0.4% fall in April. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
They were previously estimated to have decreased 1.5% in April. Services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation make up the other component of consumer spending.
U.S. stocks were lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
STRONG INFLATION
Vaccinations have allowed for a broader reopening of the economy. But the resulting demand, which is also being fired up by trillions of dollars from the government and record-low interest rates, is straining supply chains, fanning inflation.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.8% last month after rising 0.6% in April. In the 12 months through May, the PPI accelerated 6.6%, the largest gain since November 2010, after advancing 6.2% in April.
The report followed news last week that consumer prices rose solidly in May, leading to the biggest annual increase in inflation in nearly 13 years.
With the PPI and CPI data in hand, economists are forecasting that the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose at least 0.4% in May. That would push the year-on-year rate to about 3.4% from 3.1% in April. The U.S. central bank has a flexible 2% target.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. With the economy reopening, prices are rising back to normal levels in areas hardest hit by the virus. Last spring's weak readings are also dropping out from the calculation.
Fed officials started a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and were expected to keep the overnight benchmark interest rate near zero. The Fed is pumping money into the economy through bond purchases. Economists will, however, be watching to see if the Fed opens discussion about when and how it will withdraw some of the support to the economy. 
""Inflationary pressures are strong in the U.S. right now but should cool in the second half of the year,"" said Bill Adams, an economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is expected to reiterate tomorrow that more progress toward a recovery is needed before they slow their bond purchases."" 
There was some encouraging news on the supply bottlenecks, with a third report from the Fed showing production at factories increased 0.9% in May as motor vehicle assemblies jumped about 1 million units, though they remain below their average level in the second half of 2020.
Surging prices for used cars and trucks have been one of the main drivers of inflation. Some easing of the supply squeeze could help to slow inflation and support retail sales. 
Goods account for about 41% of consumer spending. Even with the boost from stimulus checks fading, consumption could get a powerful tailwind from the at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings amassed by households during the pandemic. 

Wages are rising and some households will from July through December receive income under the expanded Child Care Tax Credit program, which will soften the blow of an early termination of government-funded unemployment benefits in at least 25 states. 
""By our estimate, this program should provide approximately $16.7 billion in additional income per month in the second half of this year, for a total of $100 billion,"" said Stephen Juneau, a U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 03:11PM ET</span>",Peru economy rebounds from pandemic with nation gripped by election uncertainty,"By Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's economy grew by 58.49% in April, the government said on Tuesday, bolstered by soaring growth in key mining and fishing sectors and by a low basis for comparison with the same month in the previous year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The data came with the copper-rich Andean country stuck in a political impasse as tensions rise over the yet-to-be confirmed result of a tight June 6 run-off election between socialist Pedro Castillo and right-winger Keiko Fujimori.
Castillo, who has pledged to redraft Peru's constitution and hike taxes on mining firms, has a narrow 45,000-vote lead in the count with over 99.99% of ballots counted, but the result has been delayed with Fujimori seeking to get votes annulled.
The leftist's rise was driven by left-behind rural voters, who have felt the sharp impact of the world's deadliest per capita COVID-19 outbreak that has seen poverty and inequality levels rise as the mining-driven economy has tanked.
Government statistics agency INEI highlighted sharp expansions in the manufacturing, fishing and mining sectors as major factors contributing to Peru's fledgling recovery. Agricultural production fell off slightly, hampered by drought and a reduced planting area.
But the agency also noted that the spike in growth could be in part attributed to a low basis for comparison. Peru's economy in April 2020 contracted by 39.09%, ravaged by quarantines imposed to help contain the spread of the coronavirus.
The economy has yet to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels, the agency noted.

""The production results for April 2021 still have not exceeded the output levels registered in April 2019 (pre-pandemic year), showing a decrease of -3.46% with respect to production that month,"" it said in a statement.
The South American nation, which is the world's second largest producer of copper, has suffered the world's deadliest COVID-19 outbreak per capita, and last year posted its worst economic contraction in three decades.

(Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder confidence in the market for single family homes fell in June to its lowest level since August 2020, dented by higher housing costs and shortages in key materials such as lumber.
The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index declined to a reading of 81 this month from 83 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index would be unchanged at 83. A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index hit an all-time high of 90 in November 2020.
""While builders have adopted a variety of business strategies including price escalation clauses to deal with scarce building materials, labor and lots, unavoidable increases for new home prices are pushing some buyers to the sidelines,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ""Moreover, these supply-constraints are resulting in insufficient appraisals and making it more difficult for builders to access construction loans.""
Surging home prices and limited supply has put a lid on home sales recently, and fewer U.S. consumers believe that now is a good time to buy a home.

The NAHB survey's measure of single-family home sales expectations in the next six months fell 2 points to a reading of 79 in June, while a gauge of current sales conditions decreased 2 points to 86.
The prospective buyers index fell two points to 71.

199,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>",Sales of U.S. vacation homes rose twice as fast as other homes last year -study,"By Jonnelle Marte
(Reuters) -The U.S. housing market bounced back quickly last year after the pandemic gave some workers the flexibility to work from anywhere - and demand for vacation homes was especially hot, according to a report released on Tuesday by the National Association of Realtors. 
Sales of existing homes in counties with a higher share of vacation homes rose by 24% on average in 2020, more than double the 11% increase in counties that don't have a high concentration of vacation homes. 
Home prices also appreciated more quickly in vacation home counties, gaining an average 14% last year, compared with the average 10% annual increase in non-vacation-home counties. Buyers in vacation areas were also more likely to make all-cash offers.
Vacation-home counties were defined as those where at least 20% of the properties are for seasonal or recreational use. As of 2019, about 10% of the 3,143 counties in the United States were vacation-home counties, according to the association https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/vacation-home-sales-skyrocket-as-a-result-of-pandemic.
The hottest vacation markets were concentrated in 16 states, including North Carolina, New York, Vermont and Massachusetts. The No. 1 county, based on sales growth, price and days on the market, was Lee County in Florida, which includes cities such as Fort Myers and Cape Coral. 
In the next hottest market, Oscoda County, Michigan, home sales rose by 54% in 2020 and the median sales price increased by 79%, according to the report. The county, which is about four hours away from Detroit, includes the Huron-Manistee National Forests and Oscoda Beach Park. 
The increased demand for vacation homes was sparked by the move to work from home and the shift to virtual schooling, which gave families the flexibility to relocate, the researchers said. 
The dramatic increase in home sales in some vacation markets is a reminder of the stark inequality that struck the housing market during the pandemic, which left millions of Americans out of work and caused some to fall behind on their housing payments. 

A rush of federal aid - including direct cash payments, eviction moratoriums and a mortgage forbearance program - helped to keep many people in their homes, but some households are still struggling. 
The share of homeowners with mortgages in forbearance surged to 7% by May 2020 and slowly declined to 4% this spring, according to a report https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2021/05/keeping-borrowers-current-in-a-pandemic.html by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Borrowers in low-income areas and those with loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration were more likely to stay in forbearance for an extended period of time.

200,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories fall in April; sales rise,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories fell in April, with stocks declining at a sharper pace than initially estimated amid shortages of raw materials, which are undercutting production of motor vehicles and other goods.
Business inventories decreased 0.2% after increasing 0.2% in March, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories dipping 0.1%.
Inventories dropped 3.6% on a year-on-year basis in April.
Retail inventories decreased 1.8% in April, rather than 1.6% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.4% decrease in March. Motor vehicle inventories dropped 7.5% rather than 7.0% as estimated in an advance report published last month. Motor vehicle stocks are being run down as a global semiconductor shortage weighs on auto production.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.6% instead of 0.5% as estimated last month.
Manufacturers are battling shortages of raw materials and labor in the wake of pent-up demand unleashed by the reopening of the economy as vaccinations ease COVID-19's intensity.
With demand robust, inventories were depleted in the first quarter. The inventory drawdown subtracted nearly three percentage points from GDP growth last quarter. Still, the economy grew at a strong 6.4% annualized rate after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Most economists are forecasting double-digit GDP growth in the second quarter. 

Wholesale inventories increased 0.8% in April. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.3%.
Business sales advanced 0.6% in April after rebounding 5.8% in March. At April's sales pace, it would take 1.25 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.26 months in March.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 09:52AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing output accelerates in May on autos,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Production at U.S. factories increased more than expected in May as motor vehicle output rebounded, but shortages of raw materials and labor continue to cast a shadow over the manufacturing industry.
Manufacturing output accelerated 0.9% last month after dipping 0.1% in April, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output increasing 0.6% in May. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being underpinned by massive fiscal stimulus, low interest rates and continued strong demand for goods even as spending is shifting towards services amid a vastly improved public health situation. 
But robust demand is straining the supply chain, with shortages of raw materials and labor across the industry. 
The automobile industry has been hit by a global shortage of semiconductors, which has forced some automakers to cut production. Hyundai Motor USA said on Monday it would suspend production at its Montgomery plant in Alabama for a week because of the chip crunch and will ""will continue to take necessary measures to optimize production.""
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said last week it expected the supply squeeze to ease in the third quarter, though it saw the bottlenecks continuing in the long term.
That suggests the 6.7% increase in production at auto plants last month was likely temporary. Motor vehicle assemblies jumped about 1 million units to an annualized rate of 9.9 million units last month, but remained more than 1 million units below their average level in the second half of 2020.
Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.5% last month.
The rebound in manufacturing output combined with a 1.2% increase in mining and a 0.2% gain in utilities to boost industrial production by 0.8% last month. That followed a 0.1% rise in April. 

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.7 percentage point to 75.6%. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector was up 0.6 percentage point to 75.2%. It is 4.4 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

The regional Fed's ""Empire State"" index on current business conditions fell seven points to 17.4, lower than a reading of 23.0 forecast among analysts polled by Reuters. 

A reading above zero signals the New York manufacturing sector is expanding. 
New orders increased moderately, deliveries lengthened at a record-setting pace while inventories edged lower. New York's manufacturing firms were optimistic. The survey's six-month outlook gauge rose eleven points to 47.7. The indexes for new orders and shipments rose to similar levels.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2021 08:08AM ET</span>","Saudi inflation rate rises again in May, hits 5.7%","DUBAI (Reuters) -Saudi Arabia's inflation rate rose for the second consecutive month, climbing to 5.7% in May from 5.3% in April, again reflecting a tripling of value-added tax to 15% last year, official data showed on Tuesday.
The increase was mainly due to higher prices of food and beverages and transport, the General Authority for Statistics said. Food prices have a weight of 17% in the Saudi consumer basket, making them the main driver of the headline inflation rate in May.
The VAT increase, which went into effect in July last year, came as the Saudi government sought to bolster its coffers after being hit by the twin shock of last year's oil price crash and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as voluntary oil production cuts implemented to help stabilise world prices.
""Prices of food and beverages recorded the highest annual increase of 7.4%, mainly due to the increase in food prices (+7.3%). In particular, the increase in prices of meat (+6.8%) and vegetables (+6.7%) was remarkable,"" the General Authority for Statistics said.
Consumer prices rose slightly on a month-on-month basis, by 0.2%.
""Looking ahead, the headline inflation rate is likely to peak in June at around 6.3% y/y,"" James Swanston, an economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.
""But, from July, inflation will drop sharply as the base effects of the tripling of the VAT rate last year drop out of the annual price comparison. We think that the headline rate will slow to around 1.0-1.5% y/y and remain at this pace over the course of this year and throughout 2022-23.""

Saudi Arabia's economy shrank 3% in the first quarter of this year from a year earlier, hit by oil output cuts, but the non-oil economy expanded 2.9%, recovering from the pandemic.
The kingdom's economy, the largest in the Arab world, shrank 4.1% last year. The International Monetary Fund expects real GDP, an inflation-adjusted measure, to grow 2.1% this year.

The European Union's statistics office said the unadjusted trade surplus of the 19 countries sharing the euro was 10.9 billion euros in April compared with 2.3 billion in April 2020, as overall euro zone exports rose 43.2% while imports increased 37.4%.
But the April result fell short of market expectations of a 15.8 billion euro surplus in a Reuters poll of economists.
Exports of machinery and vehicles from the whole EU jumped 11.9% in the first four months of 2021, swelling the surplus in that category to 58.5 billion euros from 48.5 billion euros a year earlier.
The EU's trade deficit with its biggest trading partner China widened, but it was offset by increased trade surpluses with the United States and Britain.

The 27-nation bloc's overall trade volume with Britain fell after the country left the EU's internal market at the start of the year but the surplus surged because imports from Britain plunged 27.1% in January-April while exports declined only 3.3%.
Adjusted for seasonal factors the euro zone's external trade surplus was 9.4 billion euros in April, down from 18.3 billion euros in March.

LONDON (Reuters) -The number of employees on British company payrolls surged by a record amount in May as COVID restrictions eased and pubs and restaurants resumed indoor service, though it still remains more than half a million below its pre-pandemic peak.
Tax data released on Tuesday showed that British companies increased their number of employees by 197,000 in May, the biggest single-month increase since records began in July 2014, taking the total to 28.5 million. 
Tuesday's figures also showed the fastest headline wage growth since 2007 in the year to April, although statisticians warned that this was distorted by comparisons with depressed wages a year ago and greater job losses among low-paid staff.
""The level of employment is still well below its pre-crisis level, suggesting there is still plenty of slack in the labour market,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.
The headline unemployment rate fell for a fourth month in a row to 4.7% for the three months to April, in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. 
""The latest forecasts for unemployment are around half of what was previously feared and the number of employees on payroll is at its highest level since April last year,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. 
The jobless rate has been kept down by the government's furlough programme. This paid wages on 8.9 million jobs at its peak in May 2020, during the first COVID lockdown, and supported 3.4 million jobs in April 2021.
More recent ONS survey data pointed to a further fall to just over 2 million jobs by mid-May, and Tuesday's data showed the most job vacancies since the pandemic began.
The biggest rise in vacancies was in the accommodation and food service sector. The sector was hit hard hit by the pandemic, and will face an extra challenge in coming weeks as the full lifting of COVID capacity constraints has been delayed until July 19 due to the spread of a new, more infectious, COVID variant.
The Bank of England predicted last month that unemployment would only rise modestly when the furlough scheme stops at the end of September 2020, and is keeping a close eye on inflation pressures - though it still sees substantial slack.
The proportion of working-age men classed as inactive rose to a record-high 17.8%. This category includes students and people caring for family, as well as those who have given up looking for work.

Average weekly earnings in the three months to the end of April rose by 5.6% compared with a year earlier, its biggest rise since March 2007 and above forecasts.
The ONS said that although there were some signs of employers offering sign-on bonuses to attract staff, most of the rise reflected base effects and other distortions. It estimated underlying wage growth was around 3%.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's export growth shot up on a yearly basis to an 11-year high in May, supported by high commodity prices and a low base effect, while imports also jumped as domestic demand rose, official data showed on Tuesday.
Southeast Asia's largest economy has seen its exports recover vigorously from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on soaring prices of its main commodities amid improving demand from major trade partners like China and the United States.
In May, prices of commodities such as coal, palm oil and copper roughly doubled from a year earlier, helping the resource-rich country book a $2.37 billion trade surplus, the statistics bureau said, which was the highest in six months.
The poll had expected a $2.30 billion surplus in May after April's $2.19 billion surplus.
May's exports rose 58.76% to $16.60 billion, the biggest increase since January, 2010. This compared with a 57.49% rise expected in a Reuters poll and April's 51.94% growth.
Imports were $14.23 billion, up 68.68% from last year, higher than the poll's 65% growth forecast and April's 29.93% rise. May's growth was the strongest since April, 2010.
However, the robust growth figures also showed the extent the pandemic had hurt Indonesia's trade performance last year.
In the first five months of the year, Indonesia had a $10.17 billion surplus, also the highest in the past few years.

Dian Ayu Yustina, an economist at Bank Mandiri, expects the monthly surplus to narrow gradually as demand for imports climbs alongside the economic recovery, while exports are likely to remain strong in the next year.
""There is a base year effect and the economic recovery in advanced economies may not be balanced by a recovery in the supply side. Once supply catches up, commodity prices will plateau,"" she said.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers are expecting the economy to boom over the next year, with expectations for inflation, home prices, earnings and the labor market all picking up in May, according to a monthly survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
Median expectations for what inflation will look like over the next year rose for the seventh consecutive month to 4% in May. That is up from 3.4% in April and reaches a new high for the series, which launched in 2013. Expectations for inflation over the next three years increased more modestly to 3.6% from 3.1%. 
Consumers also shared a much brighter outlook for the labor market at a time when more businesses are opening up, travel is increasing and hiring is improving.
The average expectation that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher one year from now dropped to a series low of 31.9% in May, down from 34.6% in April. 
The perceived odds of losing a job over the next year also reached a new low, falling to an average of 12.6% in May from 15% in April. The shift was most pronounced among workers below the age of 40, those earning less than $50,000 in household income and people with no more than a high school degree. 

Workers also said they felt they had better odds of finding a job if they became unemployed, with the expected odds rising to 54% in May from 49.8% in April - the largest monthly increase for the series. Those expectations were the highest they've been since February 2020, but were still below pre-pandemic levels. 
Fed officials said they will soon begin discussing plans for pulling back the support they are offering to the U.S. economy through $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and low interest rates. Some economists expect the conversation could start during the policy meeting happening this week on Tuesday and Wednesday.

It said shopper numbers, or footfall, fell 9.0% on high streets week-on-week, by 7.5% in shopping centres and by 0.9% in retail parks.
""UK retail destinations suffered post Bank Holiday blues last week, with footfall dropping back by around half of the uplift recorded in the week before, when the school half-term holiday coincided with the Spring bank holiday and amazing weather,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's insights director.
Overall UK footfall increased 11.6% in the week to June 5.
Springboard said week to June 12 footfall was down 18.4% compared with the same week in 2019, before the pandemic started to disrupt traffic.
Non-essential stores reopened in England and Wales on April 12 after more than three months of COVID-19 lockdowns. They reopened in Scotland on April 26 and Northern Ireland on April 30. Indoor hospitality was allowed from May 17.
However, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce on Monday that the end of further restrictions will be delayed by several weeks following concerns about a rapid rise of Delta variant infections.

Springboard said that with the removal of restrictions set to be delayed by as much as a month, footfall is not likely to strengthen significantly over the next four weeks.

209,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone production stronger than expected in April,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production was stronger than expected in April, driven by a more than doubling of durable consumer goods output from a year earlier as economies steadily reopened after COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, data showed on Monday.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said industrial output in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.8% month-on-month for a 39.3% year-on-year surge.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.4% monthly and a 37.4% annual jump.

The biggest production gain in April against March was in durable consumer goods, where output rose 3.4% after 1.2% monthly declines in both February and March.
In year-on-year terms, the gain in durable consumer goods output was a spectacular 117.3% after a 34.5% annual rise in March, with capital goods also surging 65.4% year-on-year and intermediate goods up 38.7%.

The kingdom's economy has been hit hard by the twin shock of last year's historic oil price crash and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The non-oil sector grew 2.9%, from 1.6% growth a year earlier, while the oil sector declined by 11.7% which was a much sharper fall than the 4.6% contraction a year earlier, the General Authority for Statistics said in a statement on  Monday  (NASDAQ:MNDY). 
In flash estimates in May the authority said the economy shrank 3.3% in the first quarter and the non-oil sector grew for the first since the first quarter of 2020.
The non-oil and private sectors are at the centre of Vision 2030, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's transformation plan to wean the Saudi economy off oil.
Real GDP, an inflation-adjusted measure, shrank 4.1% last year. The International Monetary Fund expects the Saudi economy to grow 2.1% this year.
Saudi Arabia's private sector expanded by 4.4% in the first quarter and the government sector declined slightly, by 0.4%, the official data showed.
On a quarterly basis, real GDP declined by 0.5%, mainly due to an 8.7% drop in the oil sector, while the non-oil sector expanded by 4.9% compared to the fourth quarter, driven by a 6.3% private sector expansion as well as 1.7% growth in the government sector.

Crude petroleum and natural gas and petroleum refining activities was the only economic activity that did not record growth on a quarterly basis and was also the biggest drag on the quarter's decline compared to the first quarter of 2020.
Compared to a year earlier, the first quarter saw the highest economic growth in petroleum refining activities, which expanded 21.2%, followed by manufacturing, which grew 8.9%.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 14, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>",Average age of U.S. vehicles hit record 12.1 years in 2020-IHS Markit,"(Reuters) - The average age of U.S. cars and light trucks rose to a record 12.1 years in 2020, as Americans drove fewer miles and scrapped more vehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to IHS Markit.
The research firm said the two-month increase in vehicles' average age over the 2019 figure could be short-lived as sales of both new and used cars continue to pick up as the pandemic eases.
Vehicle miles traveled in the United States declined more than 13% in 2020, according to IHS, while more than 15 million vehicles were scrapped - about 5.6 percent of the total vehicle population.
Normally, such a high scrappage rate would cause average vehicle age to decline, the firm said. But fewer miles traveled, combined with lower vehicle sales during the pandemic, had the opposite effect, with average age rising from 11.9 years in 2019.

IHS researchers also said an ongoing shortage of semiconductors, which cut into vehicle production, resulted in lower dealer inventories and inflated transaction prices, in turn causing a concurrent rise in used vehicle prices.
The firm said these factors could cause the average vehicle age to go back down in 2021, as more owners sell or trade in their older used vehicles.

Trade body Make UK and accountants BDO said their quarterly gauge of manufacturing output rose at the fastest pace since the series started 30 years ago, chiming with other business surveys that show an accelerating economic recovery.
While this reflected a ""rubber band"" effect following the record-low readings seen last year, the strength of the upturn persuaded Make UK to raise its manufacturing growth forecast for 2021 to 7.8% from 3.9% previously.
""Manufacturing growth is now firmly accelerating as restrictions have been eased and economies around the globe have started to open up,"" said Fhaheen Khan, senior economist at Make UK.
""Looking forward there seems no reason to believe that this will not continue, assuming the shackles come off firmly in the second half of the year,"" he added.
Official data last week showed British manufacturing output in April remained 2.4% below its pre-pandemic level. Make UK estimated it would take until the end of 2022 to regain that level, less time than it had previously thought.
The survey's gauge of investment intentions showed growth for the first time since early 2020.

""It appears the government's introduction of the temporary super-deduction tax has provided the incentive manufacturers needed to bring forward their investment plans,"" said Richard Austin, head of manufacturing at BDO.

Compared with March, industrial output dropped 0.2% in seasonally adjusted terms as expansion in the mining sector was offset by declines in manufacturing, construction and energy, data published by national statistics office INEGI showed.
""Supply-chain frictions, cost-push pressures, lingering policy uncertainty, weak business confidence, and slow progress with the vaccination program are likely to weigh on the broad industrial sector for a while despite firmer external demand,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos.
The latest IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index showed factory activity shrinking for the 15th straight month in May due to subdued sales, raw material shortages and the COVID-19 crisis. Still, the rate of decline was the second-slowest since the pandemic hit.
In annual terms, output posted its largest jump in over 2-1/2 decades in April, rising by 35.7% in adjusted terms and by 36.6% in unadjusted terms. Both increases were the biggest registered in INEGI's online data bank, which extends back to 1994.

Industrial output hit bottom in May 2020 and has recovered as the economy gradually reopens, mobility increases, businesses adjust and external demand firms, said Goldman's Ramos, who anticipated ""significant positive spillovers from U.S. growth.""
The economy shrank by some 8.5% last year, the sharpest slump since the 1930s. Mexico is expected to recoup much of that in 2021, for which the government is forecasting 6.5% growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer sentiment rebounded in early June as inflation fears subsided and households grew more optimistic about future economic growth and employment, a survey showed on Friday.
The University of Michigan said its preliminary consumer sentiment index increased to 86.4 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 82.9 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 84.
""Stronger growth in the national economy was anticipated, with an all-time record number of consumers anticipating a net decline in unemployment,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. 
Curtin said the improvement in sentiment was largely led by middle-and higher-income households, reflecting the continued uneven nature of the economic recovery.
The survey's gauge of current economic conditions edged up to a reading of 90.6 from 89.4 in May. Its measure of consumer expectations rose to 83.8, the highest since February 2020, from 78.8. 
""Overall, taking into account the progress made in reopening and normalizing the economy as well as the state of the vaccine rollout, there is much more good in this report than bad,"" Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), said in a note.
The survey's one-year inflation expectations fell to 4.0% from 4.6%, while its five-to-10-year inflation outlook dropped to 2.8% from 3.0% in May.
While consumers have a brighter view of the job market and economy than they did in May and their inflation worries eased somewhat, people still remain concerned about high prices for things such as cars and homes. 

""Spontaneous references to market prices for homes, vehicles, and household durables fell to their worst level since the all-time record in November 1974,"" Curtin said. ""These unfavorable perceptions of market prices reduced overall buying attitudes for vehicles and homes to their lowest point since 1982.""
""Consumers tend to overreact to inflation, predicting it will be higher than it turns out to be, especially in volatile times such as these,"" Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a note. ""However, inflation perceptions can quickly turn. Should supply chain issues in auto manufacturing get ironed out, and prices of new and used cars moderate or even fall, that will go a long way to quelling inflation fears.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic sped up in April as lockdown measures eased, with the fastest monthly growth since July leaving output a record 27.6% higher than a year earlier, when the virus was rampant and lockdown tightest.
The figures on Friday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed rapid growth in the services sector as non-essential retail and hospitality businesses opened their doors after months of closure and schools fully restarted.
Economic output rose by 2.3% month-on-month in April, marking the fastest growth since July, the ONS said, and slightly above the Reuters poll consensus for a 2.2% increase.
""The jump in GDP in April was another sign that consumers are raring to spend as the economy reopens,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
However, British economic output remained 3.7% below its level in February 2020, before the pandemic led to lockdown measures, the ONS said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to fully lift lockdown restrictions in England on June 21, helped by a swift roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines that has brightened Britain's economic outlook.
But with the Delta variant of COVID-19 first detected in India spreading fast, Johnson has said the lifting of lockdown could be delayed.
April's growth came despite an unexpected 1.3% drop in industrial output, reflecting widespread maintenance of oil rigs and a shortage of computer chips for car manufacturers. 
Output in the services sector jumped by 3.4% in monthly terms in April - above all forecasts in the Reuters poll that pointed to growth of 2.8%.
Schools reopening added 0.7 percentage points to GDP growth in April, while the retail and wholesale sector added 0.9 percentage points, the ONS said.
Construction output fell unexpectedly by 2.0% in April - although the ONS said this followed a hefty 5.8% jump in March.
""Today's figures are a promising sign that our economy is beginning to recover,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Last month the Bank of England raised its forecast for British economic growth in 2021 to 7.25% from February's estimate of 5.0%.
That would be the fastest annual growth since 1941 when Britain was rearming during World War Two. But it comes after output plunged by almost 10%, the biggest drop in more than 300 years.
Trade with the EU continues to be hurt by friction from new post-Brexit trade restrictions, though by less than at the start of the year.
Compared with three years ago - the last time trade was unaffected by either COVID or fears of an imminent disruptive Brexit - British goods exports to the EU this April were 7.1% lower and imports from the EU were 15.3% lower.

Exports to the EU were also below their average for 2019.
""That is a disappointing performance, given the boom in global trade flows; UK exporters have lost market share,"" Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.

Overall sales in the world's biggest car market totaled 2.13 million vehicles in May, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.
China sold 10.88 million vehicles between January and May, up 36% from the same period a year earlier. 
A global chip shortage and surging raw material prices are having an increasing impact on automakers in the country, said Chen Shihua, senior official at CAAM. 
But Chen said CAAM remains cautiously positive about the sector's outlook. The industry body earlier expected China's overall vehicle sales to grow 6.5% this year.
Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, maintained their strong momentum, jumping 160%, with 217,000 units sold in the month.
NEV makers, such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, Xpeng Inc and BYD, are expanding manufacturing capacity in China, encouraged by the government's promotion of greener vehicles to cut pollution.

The production index measures factory output in manufacturing, mining and electricity generation.
The expansion in April beat the 46.1% jump forecast by 10 economists in a Reuters poll, and sharply higher than the 9.3% rise recorded in March.
The previous record for industrial production was a 20.2% spike in March 2009.
The sharp improvement was reflective of recovery due to base effects from a coronavirus lockdown in March last year when the government shut down all economic activity, the Statistics Department said in a statement.
Manufacturing output rose 68% year-on-year in April, driven by demand for transport equipment and other manufactures, and non-metallic mineral products and basic metal and fabricated metal products, the department said.

Electricity output rose 14.3%, while mining rose for the first time since February last year by 22.9%, according to the data.
Malaysia's exports rose 63% in April, its quickest pace since 1998, on a rise in shipments in all categories except liquefied natural gas and transport equipment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a May deficit of $132 billion, about a third of the May 2020 deficit of $399 billion, as higher employment and an earlier tax deadline this year boosted receipts sharply, even as COVID-19 pandemic-related outlays grew, the U.S. Treasury said on Thursday.
Receipts for May rose 167% to $464 billion, an increase partly attributed to last year's delay of the Internal Revenue Service income tax filing deadline until July 15. This year's deadline shifted by a month to May 17.
The Treasury also said taxes withheld from wages increased by 20% to $204 billion during May compared to a year ago, while May corporate taxes rose to $18 billion from $2 billion last year.
Outlays for May increased 4% from a year earlier to $596 billion as benefits from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid package continued to be paid out.

This spending also helped push the fiscal year-to-date deficit to a record $2.064 trillion from $1.88 trillion for the first eight months of the prior fiscal year, Treasury officials said.
Year-to-date receipts rose 29% from a year earlier to $2.607 trillion, while outlays grew 20% to $4.671 trillion.

There were a seasonally adjusted 52,499 applications from corporations, down 0.8% from April. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 57,000, an increase of 0.9% from the prior month. 

Overall, business applications rose in three of four U.S. regions last month and were higher across most industries.

The consumer index of the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce fell to 44.7 in May from 46.0 in April, when an outbreak emerged that has accounted for most of Thailand's overall COVID-19 infections and deaths.
A sluggish rollout of vaccines and political uncertainty had also undermined consumer confidence in drivers for an economic recovery, university president Thanavath Phonvichai told a briefing.
If the outbreak can be controlled this month, the economic impact is estimated at 500 billion baht to 800 billion baht this year, he said, adding a commerce confidence index also hit a record low in May.
However, consumer confidence is expected to pick up over the next six months on optimism about a pickup in vaccinations and reopening to foreign visitors, Thanavath said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale prices rose at their fastest annual pace in 13 years reflecting higher commodity costs, data showed on Thursday, a sign global inflationary pressures are pinching firms already struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic.
With companies seen slow in passing on the higher costs on to households, the uptick in wholesale inflation is unlikely to prod the Bank of Japan into withdrawing its massive stimulus any time soon, analysts say.
""We're seeing emerging signs of cost-push inflation. If this is not accompanied by rising wages, we could see Japanese consumers' purchasing power decline,"" said Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at Daiwa Securities.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for their goods, rose 4.9% in May from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed on Thursday, more than a median market forecast for a 4.5% increase.
It followed a 3.8% gain in April and was the biggest annual increase since September 2008, when a global spike in food and raw material costs pushed up a range of prices in Japan.
China also saw factory gate prices rise at their fastest annual pace in over 12 years, underscoring the tricky balance policymakers face in supporting their economies while keeping unwelcome inflationary pressures at bay.
The rise in raw material costs is particularly damaging for Japan, where state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic are cooling consumption and making it difficult for retailers to charge households more for their goods.
Core consumer prices - the key benchmark the BOJ looks at in setting monetary policy - fell 0.1% in April from a year, marking the ninth consecutive month of decline.
""Rising commodities prices reflecting the global economic recovery is pushing up wholesale prices for a broad range of goods,"" Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's price statistics division, told a briefing on Japan's wholesale price data.
""The data shows companies are starting to pass on rising costs, though the gain in wholesale prices is driven more by external factors rather than domestic demand,"" he said.
Oil and coal prices jumped 53.5% in May, while prices of nonferrous metals were up 41.6%, as robust U.S. and Chinese demand boosted raw material costs, the BOJ data showed.

Wood and lumber prices were also up 9.7%, reflecting a shortage of raw material and rising demand across the world, Shimizu said.
Investors are increasingly worried pandemic-driven stimulus measures could supercharge inflation and force central banks to tighten policy, potentially curbing the recovery.

In the latest sign of the heat in the housing market, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' price index - which reflects the proportion of surveyors reporting price increases - rose for a fourth month to +83 from +76 in April.
""With the economy performing better than could have been expected even a short while ago and the cost of money still at rock bottom levels, the principal drivers supporting demand will remain in place even after the expiry of the stamp duty holiday,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said. 
""More challenging is the question of supply, a theme coming back strongly from respondents to the survey.""
As in many other countries, demand for housing in Britain has soared since the coronavirus pandemic led to an increase in working from home and a jump in demand for bigger properties.
RICS said the mismatch between rising new buyer enquires and falling new instructions by sellers was the widest since November 2013.
However, there were signs that more properties would be coming onto the market as appraisals increased and 12-month sales expectations were flat.
British finance minister Rishi Sunak, seeking to soften the COVID-19 hit to the economy, last year exempted the first 500,000 pounds ($707,500) of property purchases in England or Northern Ireland from the stamp duty tax. In March he extended the incentive until the end of June after which there will be a 250,000 pound tax-free allowance until the end of September.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Tuesday that Britain's housing market was ""on fire"" which would probably aggravate wealth inequalities in the country.
Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden has said there was a ""risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure."" 
Rubinsohn at RICS said government measures to speed up home-building had not convinced the industry that the shortage of properties available for sale would ease any time soon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. wholesale inventories increased strongly in April as businesses replenished stocks to meet pent-up demand, but supply constraints could make it harder to maintain the current pace of inventory rebuilding. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that wholesale inventories rose 0.8% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers advanced 1.2% in March. Wholesale inventories increased 5.2% in April from a year earlier. 
Inventories are a key part of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that April's increase in wholesale inventories would be unrevised. 
""There are downside risks for the inventory build,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. ""Supply chain disruptions could become an even bigger problem, choking off producers' ability to restock depleted inventories.""
Manufacturers are battling shortages of raw materials and labor in the wake of pent-up demand unleashed by the reopening of the economy as vaccinations ease COVID-19's intensity. The supply constraints are underscored by a global semiconductor shortage, which is undercutting motor vehicle production as well as output of electrical equipment, appliances and components, raising prices and hurting sales of these goods. 
The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product also increased 0.8%. Economists maintained their lofty second-quarter GDP growth estimates, mostly in the double-digit zone, but cautioned that bottlenecks in the supply chain posed a downside risk. 
Though wholesale inventories of motor vehicles rose in April, they were down 3.3% on a year-on-year basis. Computer equipment stocks fell 1.1% in April. 
Businesses ran down inventories in the first quarter amid a burst in domestic demand. The inventory drawdown subtracted nearly three percentage points from GDP growth last quarter. Still, the economy grew at a robust 6.4% annualized rate after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. 

Sales at wholesalers rose 0.8% in April after accelerating 4.3% in March. At April's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, unchanged from March. That is the shortest period since September 2014. 
""It reflects the robust demand as economies reopen, alongside the constraints on inventories amid supply chain disruptions, micro chip shortages, and rising commodity costs,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado.

BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazilian inflation jumped to its highest monthly rate for May in a quarter century and the annual rate scaled 8% for the first time in nearly five years, figures showed on Wednesday, almost certainly confirming another punchy interest rate hike from the central bank next week.
The monthly and annual rates of increase in consumer prices were faster than economists had expected, and are likely to cast further doubt on policymakers' insistence that much of the recent rise in inflation is down to temporary shocks.
The 0.8% monthly rate of inflation, driven by electricity and housing costs, was the highest for any May since 1996 and the 8.1% annual rate was the first reading above 8% since September 2016, statistics agency IBGE said.
The median forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists were for 0.7% and 7.9%, respectively.
""Overall, the sheer pace of inflation will make for uncomfortable reading at the central bank,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics.
""Policymakers have given a clear steer that a 75bp hike in the Selic rate to 4.25% next week is on the cards. We suspect that they will signal another 75bp hike in August,"" he said.
All nine categories surveyed by IBGE showed rising prices in May. Housing costs, including electricity prices, rose 1.8% and accounted for a third of the overall rise, while transport, including fuel, rose 1.2% and accounted for just under a third of the total increase, IBGE said.
Electricity prices jumped 5.4% in the month. Brazil's worst drought in nearly a century is putting upward pressure on prices because a large part of the country's power is hydro-generated.

The central bank's year-end inflation goal is 3.75%, with a 1.5 percentage point margin of error on either side. May's data shows inflation running well above even the 5.25% upper limit of that range.
Central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said on Tuesday that policymakers are ""100% committed"" to meeting their inflation goals, and that they still think much of the recent rise is due to temporary shocks.

The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted market index fell 3.1% in the week ending June 4 from a week earlier. This reflected a 5.1% decline in applications for refinancing and was 27% lower than the same week one year ago.
The purchase index increased 0.3% from a week earlier. The week's data included an adjustment for the Memorial Day holiday.
""Home-price growth continues to accelerate, driven by favorable demographics, the recovering job market and economy, and housing demand far outpacing supply,"" Joel Kan, an economist at the MBA, said in a statement. 

Surging home prices and limited supply has put a lid on home sales recently, and a record-low percentage of U.S. consumers believe now is a good time to purchase a home.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2021 05:40AM ET</span>",China's highest producer inflation in over 12 years highlights global price pressures,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's May factory gate prices rose at their fastest annual pace in over 12 years due to surging commodity prices, highlighting global inflation pressures at a time when policymakers are trying to revitalise COVID-hit growth.
Investors are increasingly worried pandemic-driven stimulus measures could supercharge global inflation and force central banks to tighten policy, potentially curbing the recovery.
China's producer price index (PPI) increased 9.0%, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday, as prices bounced back from last year's pandemic lows. 
The PPI rise in May - the fastest on-year gain for any month since September 2008 - was driven by significant price increases in crude oil, iron ore and non-ferrous metals, the NBS said. 
Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the PPI to rise 8.5% after a 6.8% increase in April. 
Shortly after the inflation data, the National Development and Reform Commission said China will closely monitor price movements of commodities and step up price forecasts to maintain market order.
""The worry is PPI may hover at an elevated level for an extended period of time, which would create economic headaches if mid- or downstream firms fail to absorb higher costs,"" said Nie Wen, chief economist at Hwabao Trust. 
The PPI surge has yet to substantially feed through to consumer inflation, meaning the People's Bank of China is unlikely to worry for now. 
Consumer prices rose 1.3% in May - the biggest year-on-year increase in eight months - but came in below expectations for a 1.6% gain. Consumer inflation remained well below the government's official target of around 3%.
""Producer price inflation is probably close to a peak...we don't expect (consumer price inflation) to rise much above 2% in the coming quarters. As such, (the data) is unlikely to trigger any shift in monetary policy,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics. 
But there are some signs Chinese factories, facing already tight margins, are passing on higher raw material costs to overseas clients, which could reinforce the global inflation loop.

The release comes as U.S. inflation data on Thursday is being closely watched by investors, who worry another high reading might put pressure on the Federal Reserve to start thinking about tapering its stimulus.

COMMODITY PRICES
On a monthly basis, the PPI rose 1.6%, up from a 0.9% uptick in April. 
Power plants also stocked up on thermal coal to meet surging electricity demand during summer, resulting in a 10.6% month-on-month increase in prices in the coal mining and washing sector, up from 2.8% the previous month, said Dong Lijuan, senior statistician at the NBS. 
Prices for commodities including coal, steel, iron ore and copper, which affect the PPI, have surged this year, fuelled by post-lockdown recoveries in demand and ample global liquidity. 
China's imports in value terms grew at their fastest pace in 10 years in May, boosted by Chinese purchases of raw materials. 
Chinese policymakers have pledged to take measures to cool commodity prices and prevent them from being passed on to consumers.
Recent gains in the yuan had stirred speculation over whether policymakers wanted a stronger currency to offset growing imported price pressures, but the central bank told Reuters this week it will not use the exchange rate as a tool.
NBS data also showed food inflation rose 0.3% in May from a year earlier on higher prices for freshwater fish and eggs, despite still falling pork prices. That compared with a 0.7% drop in food prices in April.

Non-food prices, including airfares, gasoline and diesel prices, accelerated to 5.5%, likely bolstered by China's Labour Day Holiday at the start of May.
On a monthly basis, rising factory input costs have started to be passed onto consumers in the sales of fridges, televisions, laptops, construction materials and summer clothes, but their price gains remained mild, NBS's Dong said.

Seasonally adjusted exports increased by 0.3% on the month after an upwardly revised rise of 1.3% in March, the Federal Statistics Office said on Wednesday. 
""After eleven increases in a row, the export sector can take it easy. Especially since its outlook remains positive,"" Alexander Krueger at Bankhaus Lampe said.
Exports to the United States jumped by 59.9% compared to April last year soon after Germany entered its first lockdown to curb the coronavirus.
On the year, exports to China rose by 16% while sales to the United Kingdom rose 64%, the first increase since the beginning of the year and the UK's completion of its departure from the European Union.
Imports dropped 1.7% after an increase of 7.1% in the prior month, as more German companies reported bottlenecks and rising costs for raw materials.

""The scarcity of materials and the lack of preliminary products are weighing on industrial production,"" Thomas Gitzel at VP Bank said. 
A Reuters poll had pointed to a 0.5% rise in exports and a 1.1% drop in imports. The trade surplus grew to 15.9 billion euros from 14 billion euros in March.

Investing.com – China’s factory-gate prices jumped in May to their highest level since 2008 driven by surging commodity prices. Consumer prices also increased for the third consecutive month but at a lower-than-expected pace.
The producer price index (PPI) increased 9.0% year-on-year in May, higher than forecasts for 8.5% and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. The rise was also higher than the 6.8% growth during the previous month, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
The jump in PPI was driven by price surges in crude oil, iron ore and non-ferrous metals, said the NBS in a statement. Commodity prices, including coal, steel, iron ore and copper, surged in 2021 driven by demand recovery in post-lockdown areas and ample global liquidity.
China’s PPI is likely to climb through the second and third quarters due to higher commodity prices and low bases in 2020 before moderating later in 2021, said People’s Bank of China.
China’s policymakers have pledged to take measures to curb soaring commodity prices, including increasing supplies of raw materials and cracking down on speculation and hoarding.
However, soaring producer prices have yet to pass through to consumer prices.
The consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.3% year-on-year in May, lower than forecasts for1.6%. The CPI contracted 0.2% month-on-month in May.
Higher metal prices have mainly impacted upstream industries involved in the mining and processing of raw materials, and have had minimal influence on downstream industries like furniture and textiles, said Bloomberg Economics in an analysis.
Meanwhile, competition among smaller businesses intensified due to the rise of ecommerce and decrease in domestic demand, indicating that China’s factories are absorbing rising input costs rather than passing them on to consumers."
230,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 11:05PM ET</span>",Australia consumer sentiment slugged by Victoria coronavirus shutdown,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - A measure of Australian consumer sentiment fell for a second month in June as a coronavirus lockdown in Victoria state darkened the mood despite signs of strength across the economy.
The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment released on Wednesday fell 5.2% in June, on top of a 4.8% drop the month before.
That left the index up 14.5% on June last year when the country was emerging from a round of nationwide lockdowns. The index reading of 107.2 showed optimists still outnumbered pessimists, although the margin was narrowing.
""The latest fall in June is almost certainly due to concerns around the two-week lockdown in Melbourne,"" said Westpac chief economist Bill Evans. ""The survey was conducted during the first week of the lockdown.""
Victorian authorities are expected to soon announce a relaxation of restrictions in Melbourne with only one case of locally transmitted COVID-19 reported for Tuesday.
While sentiment fell a sharp 7.5% in Victoria, New South Wales fared better with a drop of only 1.1%.
The drop in the overall index came across all components, with the measure of family finances compared with a year ago down 8.5% and that for finances over the next 12 months falling 2.0%.
The outlook for the economy over the next 12 months dropped 10.3%, while that for the next five years fell 1.4%.
The measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item fell 4.1%.

The housing market remained a hot topic with the survey's index of house price expectations at an historically high 157, but intentions to buy falling sharply as affordability suffered.
""Surging prices and rapidly deteriorating affordability are clearly starting to weigh heavily on buyers, suggesting owner occupier activity, particularly first home buyers, is likely to fade,"" said Evans.

232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 09:54PM ET</span>",China Factory Inflation at Fastest Since 2008 on Commodity Boom,"(Bloomberg) -- Surging commodity costs drove China’s factory-gate inflation to its highest level since 2008 in May, further adding to global price pressures.
The producer price index climbed 9% from a year earlier, following a 6.8% gain in April, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 8.5% increase. Consumer prices increased 1.3% from a year ago, missing an estimate of 1.6%.
Commodity prices have rallied this year as the global recovery strengthened, pandemic-induced supply shortages persisted, and governments around the world pumped in record amounts of stimulus. Chinese policy makers have taken targeted steps to curb soaring prices, including measures to expand supply of raw materials and crack down on speculation and hoarding, while also dialing up their rhetoric to curtail costs.
So far, the impact of higher metal prices has showed up mainly in upstream industries involved in the mining and processing of raw materials, while price increases in downstream industries like furniture and textiles have been minimal, according to an analysis by Bloomberg Economics.
The pass through from PPI to consumer prices has also been limited, given that the link between the two has weakened. Intense competition among smaller businesses, spurred by the rise of e-commerce, and weak domestic demand means China’s factories are absorbing rising input costs rather than passing them on to consumers at home.
Authorities have said PPI will likely continue to climb through the second quarter before moderating in the second half of this year. However, the central bank is likely to avoid hiking interest rates in response to the inflation data and also keep liquidity in the banking system tightly balanced, economists say.

While consumer activity is picking up and exports are surging, the virus’ continued spread has capped the consumption recovery. The job market could receive support if another extra budget is passed to support vulnerable industries.

234,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>","U.S. job openings, quits hit record highs in April","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged by nearly one million to a new record high in April, while more people voluntarily left their employment, strengthening the view that a recent moderation in job growth was due to supply constraints.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday also showed layoffs hit a record low in April. Millions of unemployed Americans remain at home because of trouble securing child care, generous unemployment benefits and lingering fears over COVID-19 even as vaccines are widely accessible and the pandemic is subsiding.
""The evidence continues to grow that the lackluster job creation of recent months is a result of constraints on labor supply and that the labor market is tight,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 998,000 to 9.3 million on the last day of April, the highest level since the series began in December 2000. Vacancies rose in all four regions and were spread across nearly all industries as well as the government sector. 
Unfilled jobs in the accommodation and food services increased by 349,000. There were an additional 115,000 job openings in other services, while vacancies at manufacturers of long-lasting goods increased 78,000. But job openings decreased in educational services and mining and logging industry.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 8.3 million in April. The job openings rate shot up to an all-time high of 6.0% from 5.4% in March.
Hiring inched up to 6.1 million in April from 6.0 million in the prior month. The government reported last Friday that job growth picked up in May, with employers raising wages, but the pace of hiring was below economists' expectations for a second straight month.
Companies are struggling to find workers even as about 9.3 million people are officially unemployed. Economists expect the labor market disconnect will be resolved in the fall. Government-funded unemployment benefits will end in early September. Republican governors in 25 states, accounting for more than 40% of the workforce, are ending federal government unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly subsidy, starting on Saturday. 
Schools are set to fully reopen in the fall and more people are expected to be vaccinated against COVID-19. At least half of the adult American population is fully inoculated. 
The JOLTS report also showed 384,000 people voluntarily quit their jobs in April, lifting the total to a record 4.0 million. About 106,000 retail workers left their jobs, while professional and business services saw 94,000 resignations. 
In the transportation, warehousing and utilities industry, 49,000 workers quit. The number of quits rose in the South, Midwest and West regions. The quits rate increased to an all-time high of 2.7% from 2.5% in March.
The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. But nearly 1.8 million women have left the labor force since February 2020 mostly because of problems related to child care.
With willing workers scarce, layoffs and discharges dropped by 81,000 to a record low 1.4 million. There was a 0.95 open job per unemployed person in April. Rising job openings and voluntary quits could pressure employers to raise wages.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
TRADE GAP NARROWS
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the reopening economy was leading to a shift in domestic demand back to services from goods, with the trade deficit retreating from a record high in April as imports fell.
The trade deficit dropped 8.2% to $68.9 billion in April. The gap widened to a record $75.0 billion in March. Economists had forecast a $69.0 billion trade deficit.
Goods imports dropped 1.9% to $232.0 billion. The decline was led by a $2.6 billion drop in imports of consumer goods, which reflected decreases in textile apparel, toys, games and sporting goods as well as household appliances. Imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines also fell. 
But imports of cell phones and other household goods increased. Imports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest on record as were of those of capital goods. Imports of services increased $0.7 billion to $41.9 billion in April. They were lifted by travel and transport services.
""With the pandemic coming under control, consumers are redirecting their spending towards domestically produced services and away from imports,"" said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Exports of goods gained 1.1% to a record $145.3 billion, boosted shipments of civilian aircraft. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest on record, with crude oil shipments rising $1.0 billion. But exports of motor vehicles, parts and engines fell. Auto production has been hit by a global semiconductor shortage. 
Exports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest on record. Exports of services increased $0.7 billion amid small gains in travel, transport and charges for the use of intellectual property.
At $17.8 billion in April, the services surplus was the smallest since August 2012. Exports are likely to continue rising as global economic growth gains momentum.

When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $7.2 billion to $98.6 billion in April. 
Trade was a drag on gross domestic product growth in the first quarter. Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, after the economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the third quarter.

(Reuters) - U.S. small-business confidence edged lower last month, the first decline in four months, as a nationwide labor shortage and inflation worries weighed on business owners' economic outlook, according to a survey released on Tuesday. 
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Optimism Index fell 0.2 point to a reading of 99.6 in May after three straight monthly increases. Five of the 10 index components improved, three declined and two were unchanged.
""If small business owners could hire more workers to take care of customers, sales would be higher and getting closer to pre-COVID levels,"" NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. ""In addition, inflation on Main Street is rampant and small business owners are uncertain about future business conditions.""
A net 27% of businesses plan to create new jobs in the next three months, up 6 points from April and a record high. Last week, the trade group said in its monthly jobs report that a record-high 48% of small-business owners reported unfilled job openings in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from 44% in April.
The quality of labor ranked as businesses' ""single most important problem,"" with 26% of respondents selecting it from among 10 issues, near the survey high of 27%. Some 57% of respondents said they had few or no qualified applicants for open jobs, up from 54% in April.

The NFIB survey comes on the heels of Friday's employment report from the government, which showed the U.S. economy added 559,000 jobs in May and employers lifted wages to compete for workers as millions of Americans remain at home because of childcare issues, enhanced unemployment benefits and ongoing worries about COVID-19.
Businesses in the NFIB survey also flagged inflation as a worry, and a record 43% plan to increase prices in the next three months.

237,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2021 05:51AM ET</span>",Supply bottlenecks throttle German industrial output in April,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) -A lack of semiconductors, timber and other intermediate goods drove an unexpected fall in German industrial output in April, a further sign that massive supply bottlenecks are hampering the recovery in Europe's largest economy.
The Federal Statistics Office said industrial output dropped 1.0% on the month after a downwardly revised increase of 2.2% in March. A Reuters poll had pointed to a 0.5% rise in April.
The drop in the headline figure was driven by a decrease in consumer goods production of more than 3% and a plunge in construction activity of more than 4%.
The weaker than expected industrial figures suggest that the German economy will have to rely on household spending to support a still-fragile recovery from the coronavirus crisis.
""Such a combination is unparalleled: Order books in industry are well filled and production is falling,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said, adding that the supply problems with semiconductors were pushing down output in the car industry.
So despite well-filled order books, manufacturing will only make a limited contribution to overall economic growth in the second quarter, Gitzel said.
The economy ministry said industrial output was being hampered by supply bottlenecks for intermediate products such as semiconductors and timber. But it added that business sentiment surveys were suggesting an improvement in coming months.
Germany's Ifo business sentiment brightened in May to hit a two-year high as COVID-19 curbs were eased and infections fell, suggesting a swift summer recovery after the economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter.
Investor sentiment in Germany fell in June but remained at a high level and expectations for a strong economic recovery for the next six months are intact, a survey by the ZEW economic research institute showed on Tuesday.
The ZEW's survey of investors' economic sentiment fell to 79.8 points from 84.4 in the previous month. But a separate ZEW gauge of current conditions surged to -9.1 points from -40.1.
""The economic recovery is progressing,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement. ""The decline in expectations is probably largely due to the considerably better assessment of the economic situation, which is now back at pre-crisis levels.""
""The financial market experts therefore continue to expect a strong economic recovery for the next six months,"" he added.
Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics said the chip shortages were likely to continue to constrain the recovery but that it should be a temporary problem.
Industrial output should recover somewhat in May and June which should enable overall economic growth of at least 1% in the second quarter, Kenningham added.
In the first quarter, German GDP contracted by 1.8% on the quarter and by 3.1% on the year, significantly weaker readings than the euro zone average.

On Monday, Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the virtual opening of a Bosch semiconductor plant in Dresden that the chip shortages in manufacturing were complicating Germany's economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis.
The problem has forced many German companies to announce short-time work and scale back production, with the scarcity of components also expected to lead to higher end-prices for consumers and overall inflationary pressures.

Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro contracted 0.3% quarter-on-quarter for a 1.3% year-on-year decline. These compared with estimates three weeks ago of respectively -0.6% and -1.8%.
Italy grew marginally, against a previous estimate of a dip, and France dipped, against an earlier estimate of growth. Germany was very slightly weaker, while a number of smaller countries were more positive. 
Eurostat said rising inventories added 0.7 percentage points to the overall quarterly figure in the January-March period and investment and trade each added another 0.1 points.
Falling household consumption, hit by pandemic lockdowns including of shops across Europe, subtracted 1.2 points and government spending was neutral.

The 0.3% GDP contraction comes after a 0.6% GDP quarterly fall in the previous three months, meaning the euro zone economy was in its second technical recession since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Eurostat said also employment fell 0.3% quarter-on-quarter in January-March and was down 1.8% year-on-year.

The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) said its Thai industries sentiment index fell to 82.3 last month from 84.3 in April, when its biggest outbreak so far emerged.
The tourism-reliant country started its mass vaccination drive on Monday and is preparing a phased reopening to vaccinated foreign visitors later this year, dependent on its progress with inoculations.
""The third wave has yet resolved while new clusters continue to emerge, especially in factories, affecting the manufacturing sector. Vaccinations have also been slow,"" FTI chairman Supant Mongkolsuthree told a briefing. 
Thailand on Tuesday reported 2,662 new infections and 28 new deaths, with the current outbreak accounting for more than 80% of its total and about 93% of fatalities.

The index for the next three months, however, picked up from April on optimism over the government's economic stimulus packages and increased exports, a key driver of Thai growth.
The FTI urged the government to accelerate the vaccinations to create herd immunity, plus introduce additional financial measures to support smaller businesses, particularly in the tourism sector, which has yet to recover.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy shrank less than initially reported in the first quarter on smaller cuts to plant and equipment spending, but the coronavirus pandemic still dealt a huge blow to overall demand.
Separate data showed growth in bank lending slowed sharply in May, while real wages posted the biggest monthly jump in more than a decade in April, in signs that the world's third-largest economy was gradually overcoming last year's pandemic hit.
Among the mixed indicators are some reassuring signs for policymakers, who are worried Japan's recovery will lag major economies that have rolled out COVID-19 vaccines much quicker and are able to reopen faster.
The economy shrank by an annualised 3.9% in January-March, not as bad as the preliminary reading of a 5.1% contraction, but still posting the first fall in three quarters, Cabinet Office data showed Tuesday.
The reading, which beat economists' forecast for a 4.8% decline, equals a real quarter-on-quarter contraction of 1.0% from the prior quarter, versus a preliminary 1.3% drop.
The revised gross domestic product (GDP) decline was mainly due to a smaller fall in public and capital spending, which both eased less than initially thought, offsetting a slightly larger fall in private consumption.
""Overall, capital spending and private consumption remained weak, which showed weakness in domestic demand,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""The vaccine issue is the most important thing for the (economic) recovery,"" he said, adding that the vaccination rate would need to come to about 50% to boost economic recovery prospects.
Capital spending shrank 1.2% from the prior quarter, better than a preliminary 1.4% decrease, and matching the median forecast for a 1.2% loss. Government consumption fell 1.1%, a smaller drop than a preliminary 1.8% decline.
Private consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product, dropped 1.5% from the previous three months, worse than the initial estimate of an 1.4% drop.
However, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said spending could recover as consumers return to the streets.
""If infections subside, there'll be pent-up demand from not having been able to go eating out or travelling,"" Nishimura told reporters after the release of the data.
PANDEMIC IMPACT
Net exports - or exports minus imports - subtracted 0.2 percentage point from growth, while the hit to domestic demand pulled it down by 0.8 percentage point, not as bad as a preliminary contribution of minus 1.1 percentage point.
The better-than-expected revision comes after household spending and exports jumped in April, though the gains were inflated largely by the comparison to last year's deep pandemic-driven plunge.
Total lending by Japan's banks grew 2.9% in May from a year earlier, slowing at a record pace from a 4.8% increase in April, Bank of Japan data showed on Tuesday.
Inflation-adjusted wages, a barometer of household purchasing power, rose 2.1% in April on a year-on-year basis, the government said.
The bank lending slowdown was due largely to the base effect of a COVID-driven surge last year, while a drop in consumer prices and rebounds in overtime pay and compensation for part-time workers helped lift wages.
Separately, Japan's service sector index, based on a survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff, fell one point from April to 38.1 in May, down for a second straight month, a Cabinet Office survey showed.

The government has come under political pressure to water down an already stretched fiscal target this year as the cost to combat the health crisis accumulates.
Some analysts expect Japan's economy will contract again in the current quarter - pushing it back into a technical recession - as an extension of coronavirus emergency curbs for Tokyo and other major areas hurts domestic demand.

Gross domestic product contracted an annualized 3.9% from the final quarter of 2020, the Cabinet Office reported Tuesday. The result was better than the government’s earlier estimate of a 5.1% contraction. Economists had forecast a 5% drop.
A separate report showed wages gained in April from a year earlier at the fastest pace since late 2018 on climbing overtime pay.

243,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 07:46PM ET</span>",Japan's April real wages post largest monthly gain since 2010,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's real wages posted the biggest monthly rise in more than a decade in April as overtime pay and compensation of part-timers rebounded, although the gains were inflated due to the comparison with last year's pandemic-driven fall.
Inflation-adjusted real wages, a key measure of households' purchasing power, rose 2.1% in April year-on-year to post their largest monthly gain since July 2010, the labour ministry said on Tuesday.
The rise in inflation-adjusted real wages was partly due to a 0.5% drop in the consumer price index, as the health crisis caused prices to weaken, as well as a year-on-year rebound in compensation for part-time workers.
The figures especially underline how big an impact the coronavirus crisis has had on Japan's economy in the last year, although it is still leaving its mark on economic activity.
Nominal total cash earnings gained 1.6% in April from a year earlier, up for the second straight month, following a 0.6% rise in March, according to the data.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings and determines a wage trend - rose for the fourth straight month, gaining 0.9%.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, jumped 6.4% in April compared the same month a year earlier, posting its first year-on-year rise since August 2019. Special payments rose 8.5% in April.

The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who were employed for more than one month at a company that employed more than five people, or 2) those who were employed on a daily basis or had less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted, at a company that employs more than five people.

The British Retail Consortium said total sales among its members, who include supermarkets and high-street chains, were 10.0% higher last month than in May two years ago.
This was the biggest increase in sales compared with 2019 for any month since the start of the pandemic.
""The rain in May failed to dampen consumer demand and shoppers continued to return to the high street,"" Paul Martin, head of retail at survey sponsor KPMG, said.
Compared with May 2020, when most non-food retailers were shut due to lockdown restrictions, total sales were 28.4% higher.
Clothes, shoes and furniture saw especially strong gains in sales, the BRC said, benefiting from shoppers being able to view goods in person since non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen in April after months of closure.
Relaxed restrictions on socialising also encouraged shoppers to buy new summer clothes.
Payment processor Barclaycard, which sees almost half of credit and debit card transactions, said consumer spending was 7.6% higher than in May two years ago.
Pubs and restaurants were able to serve customers indoors from May 17, though only at reduced capacity.

Barclaycard said spending at restaurants last month was still 54% below its level two years ago, while spending at pubs and bars was 19% lower. But this was an improvement from April when sales were down 74% and 67% respectively.
Foreign travel remains highly restricted. Spending with airlines was 74% lower than in May 2019, little better than April.

(Reuters) - A record-low percentage of U.S. consumers believe now is a good time to buy a home, with worries about surging prices and a small supply of houses on the market outweighing improved sentiment about their jobs and income, a survey from home financing giant Fannie Mae showed on Monday. 
The percentage of consumers who said it is a good time to buy a home declined in May to 35% from 47%, Fannie Mae said in its monthly survey of the U.S. housing market. This reading, the lowest since Fannie Mae began the survey about a decade ago, marked the second straight monthly decline and represented a drop of 18 percentage points since March. 
In comparison, the percentage of consumers indicating that now is a bad time to purchase a home increased to 56% from 48% last month. 
The data is part of Fannie Mae's Home Purchase Sentiment Index (HPSI), which increased by 1.0 point to 80.0 last month and is up 12.5 points from a year earlier. The index's record high was 93.8 in August 2019.
""The 'good time to buy' component fell further - hitting another all-time survey low – as consumers appear to be acutely aware of higher home prices and the low supply of homes, the two reasons cited most frequently for that particular sentiment,"" Fannie Mae Chief Economist Doug Duncan said in a statement.

The improvement of a U.S. economy that had been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic has left a challenging environment for home buyers.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) reported last Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreased 4% from a week prior to the lowest in more than a year.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's annual consumer inflation accelerated to 6.0% in May, overshooting expectations and adding arguments for tighter monetary policy days before the central bank's rate-setting meeting, data showed on Monday.
Inflation, the central bank's main area of responsibility, accelerated to its highest since October 2016 when the central bank's key interest rate was at 10%.
The data from the statistics service Rosstat comes ahead of the bank's board meeting due on Friday where it is expected to raise the key rate for the third time in a row, by 25 or even 50 basis points from 5%.
The year-on-year increase in the consumer price index was above analysts' expectations for a rise of 5.8% in a Reuters poll.
Central bank analysts predicted May inflation at 5.7%-5.9%, warning it was on track to speed up further in the coming months.
The central bank targets annual consumer inflation of 4%. It overshot the target in late 2020 amid global inflation and as the weaker rouble filtered into prices in Russia.

The YouGov/Cebr figures add to signs of a rapid rebound in Britain's economy in the second quarter when lockdown restrictions in place since the start of the year eased for many retailers, pubs and restaurants.
""Undeterred by the unusually wet weather last month, UK consumers have clearly made the most of their newfound freedoms and spent freely in shops and the hospitality sector,"" said Kay Neufeld, head of forecasting at economic consultants Cebr.
Economists polled by Reuters expect on average that April gross domestic product data due on Friday will show a 2.2% rise from March and will be a massive 27.6% higher than a year earlier, when Britain was in the depths of its first lockdown.
The biggest contribution to the increase in the YouGov/Cebr index came from components measuring house prices and expected job security.
Mortgage lender Halifax reported earlier on Monday that house prices last month were 9.5% above their level a year earlier, the biggest increase in nearly seven years.

Business surveys also point to a sharp bounce back.
But the picture is more muted from Britain's longest-running survey of consumer sentiment, which does not ask about house prices and places a greater weight on households' experience over the past year. This measure, published by GfK, shows sentiment back at roughly its pre-pandemic level in April.

249,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2021 06:51AM ET</span>",China's imports grow at fastest pace in decade as materials prices surge,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China's imports grew at their fastest pace in 10 years in May, fuelled by surging demand for raw materials, although export growth slowed more than expected amid disruptions caused by COVID-19 cases at the country's major southern ports.
While a brisk recovery in developed markets has bolstered demand for Chinese products, a global semiconductor shortage, higher raw material and freight costs, logistics bottlenecks and a strengthening yuan have dimmed the outlook for the world's largest exporting nation.
China's exports in dollar terms in May grew 27.9% from a year earlier, slower than the 32.3% growth reported in April and missing analysts' forecast of 32.1%.
""Exports surprised a bit on the downside, maybe due to the COVID cases in Guangdong province which slowed down the turnover in Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, adding that turnover at ports in Guangdong will likely remain slow in June.
Major shipping companies warned clients of worsening congestion at Shenzhen's Yantian port in Guangdong province after the discovery of several cases among port staff.
On the ground in Guangdong, factories have yet to report widespread capacity cuts over the outbreak but admitted efficiency issues as they tried to meet overseas demand. 
Chen Linsheng, chief operating officer at Anlan, a Shenzhen-based manufacturer of skincare and beauty-care devices, told Reuters while there was no impact on production, staff are now subject to a series of COVID tests and not allowed back into the factory without a negative result.
""We are not allowed going out (of the city). We need to report in advance and cannot even go to Guangzhou or Foshan on our own,"" said Chen, adding that a lot of meetings have moved back online.
Besides the impact of COVID cases in Guangdong, the global chip shortage has started to hit all of China's export items related to semiconductors, said Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING.
For example, auto processing products and parts, the biggest export item, fell 4% from a year earlier, Pang added.
Two-year average growth for exports dropped to 23.4% in May from 36.3% in April, pointing to weaker export momentum as the reopening of developed economies reduce demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and work-from-home (WFH) products, analysts at Nomura said in a note.
At the same time, the currency's extended rally in recent weeks to near three-year highs against the dollar could further saddle U.S. consumers with higher prices.
PRICE-DRIVEN SURGE
Imports increased 51.1% on year last month in dollar terms, the fastest growth since January 2011 but slower than the 51.5% rise tipped by the Reuters poll.
However, that figure -- a gauge of import values, not volumes -- was partly flattered by hot raw materials prices with demand for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper driven by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said while import prices increased at a rapid pace, import volumes probably edged down in May.
""Once again, supply constraints are partly to blame – inbound shipments of semiconductors continued to drop back,"" he said. ""So too did imports of industrial metals.""
Indeed, iron ore futures dipped more than 3% on Monday as the trade data cast a shadow over demand prospects.
China posted a $45.53 billion trade surplus for the month, wider than the $42.86 billion surplus in April but less than the $50.5 billion expected.

The Biden administration is conducting a review of U.S.-China trade policy, ahead of the expiry of the Trump-era ""Phase 1"" deal at the end of 2021, which called for China to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and manufactured products.

The Federal Statistics Offices said orders for industrial goods fell by 0.2% in seasonally adjusted terms, the first drop this year after three successive increases.
The reading confounded a Reuters forecast of a 1.0% rise and came after an upwardly revised increase of 3.9% in March. 
A breakdown of the data showed that domestic demand fell by 4.3% while foreign demand rose by 2.7%.
Both consumer and capital goods posted an increase while intermediate goods contracted by 1%, the data showed.
The German economy contracted by 1.8% in the first quarter as lockdown restrictions in place since November dampened household spending and raw material shortages created manufacturing bottlenecks.
The German economy has withstood the pandemic much better than in neighbouring France or in Italy, mainly as a result of an unprecedented rescue package introduced by Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition government and a decision to keep factories open during three waves of COVID-19.
Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, linked the slight drop in orders to supply chain disruptions that were exacerbated by the blockage of the Suez Canal in early April.
""After the very disappointing start to the second quarter, with retail sales dropping by 5.5% month-on-month in April, the second hard data point for the quarter suggests that the expected rebound of the German economy has been slower than expected,"" Brzeski wrote in a note.

""The rebound in German industry is set to continue, only not necessarily following a straight line,"" he added.
Germany holds a national election in September. Merkel's conservative bloc holds a slight edge in polls over the ecologist Greens and the two parties are tipped to form a coalition after the election.

Investing.com – Chinese imports grew at their fastest pace in a decade in May, boosted by the recent surge in commodity prices. However, export growth was lower than expected in the same month.

Monday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group showed total job ads jumped 7.9% in May from April, when they rose 4.9%.
At 213,894, ads were at their highest level since 2008 and up almost 220% on a year earlier when a national pandemic lockdown shut many industries. The latest shutdown in Victoria had yet to make an impact.
""The Victorian lockdown is unlikely to derail the state’s labour market recovery,"" said ANZ senior economist, Catherine Birch. 
""Even if we see some employment losses in June, as long as restrictions start easing from 11 June as currently planned, workers should be reinstated or find new jobs quite quickly, given the underlying strength in the labour market.""
Unemployment has fallen much quicker than policy makers expected to hit 5.5% in April, down from a pandemic peak of 7.5% reached in July last year.
ANZ see the jobless rate at 4.8% by year end and 4.4% at the end of 2022.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is aiming to drive unemployment down to 4% or even lower in the hope of finally lifting wage growth and inflation after years of tepid gains.

The Resolution Foundation, a think tank that studies living standards, said low-paid workers were returning to their jobs from furlough leave in large numbers.
But the furlough scheme, which has a high concentration of low-paid workers in sectors like hospitality, is due to close in September - raising the risk that many of these workers will be left unemployed, the Resolution Foundation said. 
Its research showed workers ranked in the bottom fifth for pay were three times more likely to have lost jobs, hours or have been furloughed than the top-paid fifth.
""Big risks still lie ahead. Low-paid workers are most at risk from the expected rise in unemployment later this year, which also risks causing greater job insecurity,"" said Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation.

""The government can salute the vital contribution of Britain's low-paid workers by offering them a new post-pandemic settlement – from better pay via a higher National Living Wage to greater security of working hours, and proper enforcement to tackle labour market abuses.""

257,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 07:17PM ET</span>",Fewer Americans blame COVID for preventing them from seeking work,"By Evan Sully
(Reuters) - Fewer Americans are citing the coronavirus pandemic as the reason why they're not looking for work as more people are getting vaccinated and unemployment steadily declines. 
The Labor Department on Friday reported that 2.5 million people did not look for work in May because of COVID-19, down from 2.85 million the month before and 9.7 million a year ago. That represents about 2.5% of the roughly 100 million working-age Americans who were not in the labor force in May versus 9.5% of those not working or looking for a job a year ago. 
""With more ... of the U.S. adult population now fully vaccinated and daily case counts steadily declining, we believe hurdles related to COVID have continued to subside and led some workers to return to the labor force in May,"" said Shannon Seery, Economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
Nearly 52% of the U.S. population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination, according to a Reuters tally, while almost 42% have been fully vaccinated.
The figures on those not looking for work due to COVID came alongside the government's monthly employment report, which showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 559,000 jobs in May after rising 278,000 in April. 
The Labor Department in May 2020 began asking households an additional set of questions about how COVID was affecting their ability to work, and last month's data showed a fourth straight monthly decline in those blaming the pandemic for keeping them on the sidelines of the job market.
""An improving health situation would make COVID less of a factor in individuals’ decision not to look for work,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, Lead Economist at Oxford Economics. 

Additionally, the report showed just 25.2 million Americans either teleworked or worked from home in May as a result of COVID, representing 16.6% of the nearly 152 million people working last month. That's down by roughly half from last May's 48.7 million people who were working remotely, then more than a third of all those employed. 
More employers have begun calling workers back to offices, and waves of businesses that need staff on site, like restaurants, have reopened in recent weeks as pandemic restrictions have eased.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2021 04:01PM ET</span>","U.S. job growth picks up, desperate employers boost wages to attract workers","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers increased hiring in May and raised wages as they competed for workers, with millions of unemployed Americans still at home because of childcare issues, generous unemployment checks and lingering fears over COVID-19.
Though the pickup in job growth shown in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday missed economists' forecasts, it gave assurance that the recovery from the pandemic recession remained on track.
The economy is being supported by vaccinations against the virus, massive fiscal stimulus and the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance. April's nonfarm payrolls count, which delivered about a quarter of the new jobs economists had forecast, caused handwringing among some analysts and investors that growth was stagnating at a time when inflation was rising.
""There are still a lot of people unemployed, but there does not seem to be a lot of eagerness to work,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""There would have been many more hires if employers could find more people.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 559,000 jobs last month after rising 278,000 in April. That left employment about 7.6 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 650,000 jobs created in May. About 9.3 million people were classified as unemployed last month. There are a record 8.1 million unfilled jobs.
With at least half of the American population fully vaccinated, authorities across the country have lifted virus-related restrictions on businesses, which nearly paralyzed the economy early in the pandemic. But the reopening economy is straining the supply chain.
Though women took 56.2% of the jobs created last month, they constitute a large share of the millions of workers still at home as most school districts have not moved to full-time in-person learning. Nearly 1.8 million women have left the labor force since February 2020.
Despite vaccines being widely accessible, some segments of the population are reluctant to get inoculated, discouraging some people from returning to work. Government-funded benefits, including a $300 weekly unemployment subsidy, are also constraining hiring.
Republican governors in 25 states, accounting for more than 40% of the workforce, are terminating this benefit and other unemployment programs funded by the federal government starting next Saturday.
The expanded benefits end in early September across the country, which together with more people vaccinated and schools fully reopening in the fall, is expected to ease the worker crunch.
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said claims that enhanced benefits were discouraging jobseeking were not supported by what workers were telling him.
""Working people across America are eager to work,"" said Walsh in a statement. ""But workers also told me about the challenges they and their families face, finding affordable childcare, caring for elderly parents and grandparents""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

WILLING WORKERS SCARCE
But labor shortages could remain a fixture. A U.S. Chamber of Commerce survey on Friday showed 61% of unemployed people were in no hurry to return to work. Three in 10 said they did not expect to resume working this year, with nearly half of those indicating they never plan to work again.
Average hourly earnings rose a solid 0.5% after shooting up 0.7% in April. That raised the year-on-year increase in wages to 2.0% from 0.4% in April. Wages in the leisure and hospitality sector jumped 1.3%, the third straight month of gains above 1%.
Postings on Poachedjobs.com, a national job board for the restaurant/hospitality industry, are showing restaurants offering as much as $30-$35 per hour for lead line cooks.
Sustained wage growth could strengthen the argument among some economists that higher inflation could persist rather than being transitory as currently envisioned by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. A measure of underlying inflation tracked by the Fed for its 2% target accelerated 3.1% on a year-on-year basis in April, the largest increase since July 1992.
Still, most economists do not expect the U.S. central bank to start withdrawing its massive economic support anytime soon.
""It is unlikely to convince Powell that progress has been 'substantial' enough just yet to start signaling tapering,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
The average workweek held steady at 34.9 hours. That together with strong wage gains lifted an income proxy 0.9%, matching April's gain. This bodes well for consumer spending, which could also get a powerful tailwind from the more than $2.3 trillion in excess savings amassed during the pandemic.
Economists are sticking to their forecasts for double-digit growth this quarter.
Last month's increase in hiring was led by the leisure and hospitality industry, which added 292,000 jobs, with restaurants and bars accounting for 186,000 of those positions. Local government education employment rose by 53,000 jobs as the resumption of in-person learning and other school-related activities in some parts of the country continued.
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 23,000 jobs. But construction employment decreased by 20,000 jobs.

The unemployment rate fell to 5.8% from 6.1% in April. The drop was in part due to 53,000 people leaving the labor force. The jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this problem, the unemployment rate would have been 6.1% and about 8.5% accounting for those outside the labor force.
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 61.6% from 61.7% in April. Men dropped out of the labor force last month, while 204,000 women returned.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada lost more jobs than expected in May amid continued lockdowns to curb a harsh third wave of COVID-19, data showed on Friday, but economists were quick to predict a rush of hiring in June as those restrictions ease.
Some 68,000 jobs were lost in May, Statistics Canada said, more than the average analyst forecast for a loss of 20,000. The unemployment rate climbed to 8.2%, in line with expectations. Employment is now 3% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said.
""I am hopeful that this is the last down-print we have before we release a fury of hiring activity starting in June,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of Capital Market Economics at Scotiabank.
Many Canadian provinces are easing restrictions as new COVID-19 infections plummet and more Canadians get their jab. Canada has administered first doses to about 60% of its adult population, with just over 6% fully vaccinated.
That should bolster the reopening of ""high-contact"" service sectors, where employment remains furthest below pre-pandemic levels, with hiring set to ramp up in subsequent months as businesses respond to a surge of pent-up demand. 
""With households sitting on an exceptionally large stockpile of savings built up during the pandemic, that recovery could accelerate relatively quickly over the summer,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC, in a note.
While the Canadian economy has not weathered the third of wave of infections quite as well as it did the second, the expected second-half boom should allow the Bank of Canada to look past the disappointing May numbers, economists said.
""The Bank of Canada will fully look through it,"" said Holt. ""(The data) will be less choppy as we go into the second half of the year.""
The Bank of Canada is expected to taper its asset purchase program again in the third quarter and has signaled it could start hiking rates as soon as late 2022. 
Part-time and full-time employment both dropped in May, and jobs were lost in the goods sector for the first time since April 2020. 

Long-term unemployment held relatively steady, while the participation rate for core-age women fell for the second consecutive month in May, dipping back below pre-pandemic levels. 
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% higher at 1.2082 to the greenback, or 82.77 U.S. cents, as the U.S. dollar broadly lost ground.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders dropped 0.6% in April after increasing 1.4% in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders slipping 0.2%. Orders surged 14.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services during the pandemic. But the strong demand is straining supply chains. The Institute for Supply Management reported this week that manufacturing activity picked up in May, but noted that companies were struggling to fill orders because of shortages of raw materials and labor.
Factory goods orders in April were weighed down by a 6.1% decrease in orders for motor vehicles and parts. Orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 0.7%.
Unfilled orders at factories gained 0.2% after rising 0.5% in March. The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, surged 2.2% in April instead of 2.3% as reported last month.

Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.9%, unrevised from last month's estimate. 
Business investment on equipment has enjoyed double-digit growth over the last three quarters, also driven by massive fiscal stimulus to soften the blow to the economy from the public health crisis.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece's economy expanded in January-to-March 2020 at a faster pace compared to last year's fourth quarter, helped by investments, the country's statistics service (ELSTAT) said on Friday.
Seasonally adjusted data showed gross domestic product grew 4.4% from an upwardly revised 3.4% growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2020.
The data showed the economy shrank at an annual 2.3% clip in the first quarter, at a slower pace from a downwardly revised 6.9% decline in the previous quarter.
""Looking at quarterly data, the impact of the pandemic continued to subside with the economy on an expansion track for the third consecutive quarter,"" said National Bank's senior economist Nikos Magginas.
Investments were the main driver behind the economy's performance in this year's first quarter with net exports continuing to weigh, he said.
The government's official projection is for a 3.6% rebound this year after last year's 8.2% economic slump. The European Commission's projection in February sees Greece's economy growing by 3.5% this year.
""Despite the high cost it incurred to confront the health crisis, the Greek economy showed endurance, stamina,"" Finance Minister Christos Staikouras said in a statement.

Earlier this week International Monetary Fund officials said the economy should grow by 3.3% this year and 5.4% in 2022, fuelled by European recovery fund investment, pent-up consumer demand and an expected return of tourism.
""Based on the first quarter's performance we see upside risks, the economy is likely to rebound by more than 4.7% on an annual basis, particularly if there is a positive contribution from the external sector, mainly tourism,"" Magginas said.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 3.1% month-on-month in April but were 23.9% higher than a year earlier.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected only a 1.2% monthly fall and forecast a 25.5% year-on-year surge.

Eurostat said sales of non-food products, excluding fuel for cars, plunged 5.1% on the month though were a 42.6% higher than in April 2020. Sales of automotive fuel were 0.4% higher on the month and a massive 65.5% higher year-on-year.
Retail sales are seen as a proxy indicator for consumer demand. That is in turn key for trends in inflation, which the European Central Bank wants to keep below but close to 2% over the medium term. It already reached 2% in May and is likely to move higher, even if only temporarily, this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely shrank slightly less than initially estimated in the first quarter, a Reuters poll showed, though state of emergency curbs to combat the coronavirus pandemic are seen keeping any rebound in the current quarter modest.
Separate data due next week will also show wholesale prices continued to rise sharply in May, a sign rising raw material costs are squeezing corporate profits, the poll also showed on Friday.
Revised gross domestic product (GDP) data will likely show the world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 4.8% in January-March, less than a preliminary reading of a 5.1% drop, according to economists polled by Reuters.
The revision largely reflects a smaller-than-expected fall in capital expenditure, after incorporating the Ministry of Finance's quarterly corporate survey released after the preliminary GDP announcement.
Despite the upward revision, many analysts remain cautious about Japan's economic outlook as extended state of emergency curbs weigh on consumption, offsetting the boost to growth from robust exports.
""We expect Japan's economy to suffer two straight quarters of contraction in April-June as chip supply shortages hurt car output and state of emergency curbs weigh on consumption,"" said Saisuke Sakai, an economist at Mizuho Research & Technologies.
Automakers across the globe, including those in Japan, have suffered disruptions in output due to a shortage of semiconductors, which some makers blame on a faster-than-expected recovery in demand from the pandemic.
The government will release revised January-March GDP data on June 8 at 8:50 a.m. (June 7, 2350GMT).
Japan's wholesale prices likely rose 4.5% in May from a year earlier after jumping 3.6% in April, according to the poll.

While the increase is due partly to the base effect of last year's plunge caused by the pandemic, it also reflects rising energy and commodities costs that could worsen terms of trade for an economy heavily reliant on raw material imports.
The Bank of Japan will release the wholesale price data on June 10 at 8:50 a.m. (June 9, 2350GMT).

Although the statistical base effects of sharp declines seen a year ago are seen keeping trade growth elevated, real demand has also made a significant recovery.
Exports are expected to have risen 32.1% in May from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 economists, largely in line with a 32.3% gain in April.
Imports likely rose 51.5% in May versus a year ago, the poll showed, higher than the 43.1% growth in April. Analysts attributed the jump to surging commodity prices, revived domestic demand and a low base effect.
China's commerce ministry said on Thursday it expects outbound shipments to maintain good momentum in the first half of 2021.
""Demand in developed economies stayed elevated in May, and the resurgence of coronavirus cases in emerging markets has led to slow production and continued shift of orders to China,"" said analysts with China Minsheng Bank.
Solid demand was seen in U.S. and European factory surveys, which showed manufacturing activity expanding at the fastest clip in years.
However, exporters are grappling with higher raw material and freight costs, logistics bottlenecks and a strengthening yuan, which diminishes trade competitiveness.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
China's policymakers have expressed concern about rising commodity prices in recent weeks and called for stricter management of supply and demand and to crack down on ""malicious speculation.""
The yuan is near three-year highs against the U.S. dollar, having risen 1.4% over the past four weeks.
China's official PMI on Monday showed factory activity growth slowed slightly in May as raw materials costs shot up, weighing on the output of small and export-oriented firms. 
The trade surplus is expected to be $50.5 billion in May, widening from $42.86 billion in April, the poll showed. The data will be released on Monday.

""The pandemic-induced surge in China's share of global exports is likely to reverse in the coming quarters as virus disruptions fade and global consumption patterns return closer to normal,"" said analysts with Capital Economics.
They also expect recent policy tightening to become a more forceful drag on the economy later this year.

Growth in temporary staff placements also hit a six-year high, according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) trade body and accountants KPMG.
""We now have a consistent picture over the past few months to show that confidence is growing and hiring plans are in motion,"" Kate Shoesmith, REC deputy chief executive officer, said.
Starting salaries rose last month at the fastest rate since September 2018 as the availability of staff declined sharply, which REC linked to pandemic uncertainty and fewer EU candidates. 
""With demand spiking, the skills and labour shortages that already existed in the UK have come into sharper focus – and COVID has only made them worse,"" Shoesmith said.

""This is the most pressing issue in the jobs market right now, and has the potential to slow down the recovery.""

266,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2021 05:57PM ET</span>",Record-high number of U.S. small businesses can't fill job openings - NFIB,"By Evan Sully
(Reuters) - Nearly half of U.S. small business owners reported unfilled job openings in May, marking the fourth consecutive month of record-high readings as finding qualified applicants remains a lingering challenge, a trade group said on Thursday.
The National Federation of Independent Business said in its monthly jobs report that 48% of small business owners reported unfilled job openings in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, up from 44% in April. May's reading is 26 points higher than the 48-year average of 22%.
Furthermore, the report showed that 93% of owners looking to hire reported few or no “qualified” applications for the positions they were trying to fill last month.
Forty percent of small businesses surveyed currently have job openings for skilled workers and 27 percent have openings for unskilled labor, up 3 points and 7 points, respectively. 
“Small business owners are struggling at record levels trying to get workers back in open positions,” NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said in a statement. “Owners are offering higher wages to try to remedy the labor shortage problem. Ultimately, higher labor costs are being passed on to customers in higher selling prices.”
The report comes as the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell below 400,000 last week for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began more than a year ago.

Additionally, hiring seems to have strengthened in May. The ADP National Employment Report showed on Thursday that private payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs, which was the largest increase since June 2020, after rising by 654,000 in April.
The Department of Labor will release data on nonfarm payrolls on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast nonfarm payrolls increased by 650,000 jobs in May after rising by just 266,000 in the previous month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped below 400,000 last week for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago, pointing to strengthening labor market conditions.
That was underscored by other data on Thursday showing private payrolls increasing by the most in 11 months in May, spurred by robust demand amid a rapidly reopening economy. The data supported expectations that job growth accelerated last month, though shortages of workers and raw materials continue to loom over the labor market recovery.
""The economic reopening is continuing and should be positive for job growth,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""But supply and demand imbalances are creating frictions in the labor market that could be a headwind in the near term.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 385,000 for the week ended May 29. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 390,000 applications for the latest week.
The fifth straight weekly decrease in claims was led by Texas and Florida. 
The pandemic is subsiding because of vaccinations, allowing authorities to lift restrictions on businesses and accelerating the economy's reopening. That has led to a surge in demand that is pushing against supply constraints.
Though claims remain well above the 200,000-250,000 range that is associated with healthy labor market conditions, they have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. 
They could decline further as Republican governors in 25 states, including Florida and Texas, are cutting off unemployment programs funded by the federal government for residents starting next Saturday. 
These states account for more than 40% of the workforce. About 4 million workers will be affected. The benefits being terminated early include a weekly $300 unemployment subsidy, which businesses say is discouraging the jobless from seeking work. The expanded benefits will end in early September across the country. Economists estimate unemployment benefits payments totaled $35.1 billion in May. 
Some doubt that an early termination of these benefits will lead to a surge in hiring and warn economic growth could slow. 
""We don't know if cutting this lifeline for some jobless workers is going to lead to greater payroll employment gains,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""Less money paid out as unemployment benefits will slow economic growth if it does not lead to new paychecks quickly.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
HIRING PICKING UP
But hiring appears to have improved in May, with the ADP National Employment Report showing private payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs, the biggest increase since June last year, after rising 654,000 in April. Economists had forecast private payrolls would increase by 650,000 jobs in May.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive, and closely watched employment report for May on Friday. It, however, has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count in the employment report because of methodology differences.
According to a Reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls likely increased 650,000 jobs in May after rising only 266,000 in April. But this forecast is tempered by widespread worker and raw material shortages documented in business surveys.
In a third report on Thursday the Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing activity index rebounded to a record high of 64 in May from a reading of 62.7 in April. But businesses in the sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, complained about the dearth of workers. Some reported offering ""cash incentives of $50"" for people who show up for an interview. 
The findings mirrored an ISM survey on manufacturing this week showing shortages of parts and workers were forcing short-term shutdowns at factories. 
The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed on Wednesday that ""it remained difficult for many firms to hire new workers, especially low-wage hourly workers, truck drivers, and skilled tradespeople.""
Workers are scarce despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed. The expanded unemployment benefits, problems with child care and fears of contracting the virus, even with vaccines widely accessible, as well as pandemic-related retirements have been blamed for keeping workers home.
The claims report also showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid increased 169,000 to 3.771 million during the week ended May 22. These so-called continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, are being closely watched for signs on how quickly hiring will pick up. There were about 15.4 million people on unemployment benefits under all programs in mid-May. 

""This reminds us that a full recovery of jobs lost during the pandemic will be a more uneven process,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
A fourth report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed job cuts announced by U.S.-based employers rose 7% last month to 24,586. Layoffs were, however, down 93.8% from May 2020. Employers have announced 192,185 job cuts this year, down 86% compared to the same period in 2020.

Nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at an unrevised 5.4% annualized rate last quarter, the Labor Department said. Productivity fell at a 3.8% rate in the fourth quarter. Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would be raised to a 5.5% rate. 
Productivity shot up early in the pandemic before slumping in the final three months of 2020. Economists attributed the jump to the hollowing out of lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which they said tended to be less productive.
Compared to the first quarter of 2020, productivity rose at an unrevised 4.1% rate. 
Hours worked increased at a 3.0% rate last quarter, revised slightly up from the 2.9% pace estimated last month.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - increased at a 1.7% rate. They were previously reported to have dropped at a 0.3% pace. Unit labor costs surged at a 14.0% rate in the fourth quarter. They rose at a 4.1% pace from a year ago, instead of at a 1.6% rate as previously reported. 

They have also been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries.
Hourly compensation increased at a 7.2% rate last quarter, rather than the previously reported 5.1% pace. That followed a 9.7% growth pace in the fourth quarter. Compensation increased at an 8.3% rate compared to the first quarter of 2020, revised up from the previously estimated 5.8% pace.

Private payrolls increased by 978,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Thursday, the biggest increase since June last year. Data for April was revised down to show 654,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 742,000. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 650,000 jobs.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics and was published ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive, and closely watched employment report for May on Friday. However, it has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count in the employment report because of methodology differences.
The ADP report overestimated private payroll gains in April's employment report, after understating growth throughout much of the jobs recovery, which started in May 2020, leaving economists cautious about reading too much into the report.
""The inconsistencies comparing the ADP and government data make it very hard to use the ADP figures to predict the first prints of the government data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls likely increased by 600,000 jobs in May after rising only 218,000 in April. With government hiring expected to have increased by about 50,000, that would lead to overall payrolls advancing by 650,000 jobs in May. The economy created 266,000 jobs in April.

The forecasts were tempered by data on Tuesday showing a moderation in hiring at factories, with manufacturers complaining that worker absenteeism and short-term shutdowns because of shortages of parts and workers was limiting the sector's potential. 
An easing in the COVID-19 pandemic's grip due to vaccinations has allowed authorities to lift restrictions on businesses, accelerating the economy. The ensuing pent-up demand is, however, pushing against supply constraints.

The numbers come ahead of Friday’s Labor Department employment report, which is expected to show the economy added 655,00 jobs in May, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Claims data have been volatile during the pandemic amid backlogs, fraud and new programs. Also, more than 20 states have recently announced plans to pull out of federal unemployment benefit programs amid a debate about whether generous aid is making it more difficult for employers to hire.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 55.1 in May, down from 56.3 in April but still well in expansionary territory. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The survey attributed part of the slowing expansion to a fall in overseas demand as COVID cases abroad hurt business activity. A gauge of export orders slipped into contraction.
The Caixin PMI contrasts with an official survey released earlier this week, which showed activity in China's services sector expanded at a faster pace in May.
Though slower to recover from the epidemic than manufacturing, a gradual improvement in consumption has stimulated activity in China's services sector, which includes many smaller and private companies.
Growth in total new orders slipped and services firms increased their staffing levels for the third straight month, but at a slower pace, the Caixin survey showed.
Inflation pressures worsened with input costs rising at a sharper rate in May and reports of more expensive raw materials, energy, staff and transport, the survey found.
Even though firms were able to raise selling prices for the 10th straight month, the increases have yet to catch up with the inflation in input costs.
""Services supply and demand continued their upward trends for the 13th consecutive month, though both expanded at a slower pace than in the previous month,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.

""Inflationary pressure was enormous as price gauges continued to rise. Both the measures for input costs and the prices service providers charged rose to their highest points of the year."" 
The Caixin China General Composite PMI came in at 53.8 in May, weaker than 54.7 the previous month.

Inflation had quickened to 17.14% in April, the highest since mid-2019, due to the lira's sharp fall after President Tayyip Erdogan sacked a hawkish central bank governor in March. 
The currency weakened further in May, raising expectations of higher inflation due to imports priced in hard currencies. The median estimate in a Reuters poll for annual inflation was 17.25%.
Month-on-month, consumer prices rose 0.89%, the Turkish Statistical Institute said, compared to a Reuters poll forecast of 1.46%. Graphic: Turkish inflation drops from two-year peak, https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-ECONOMY/INFLATION/yzdvxmnqypx/chart.png 
Turkey was under lockdown in the first half of May aimed at slowing the spread of new COVID-19 cases. Economists said a ban on the sale of some items during the lockdown curbed price rises but that hikes would be implemented in June.
""The limited price rises in groups other than food due to reduced demand because of the lockdown had a large impact on the drop in annual inflation,"" said Haluk Burumcekci, of Burumcekci Consulting.
The rise in clothing prices was far below last year's level, he said.
POLICY
The month-on-month rise was driven by increases in transportation, clothing and footwear, while the annual rise was driven by health, household equipment and transportation.
The producer price index rose 3.92% month-on-month in May, the data showed, for an annual rise of 38.33%. That is expected to contribute to headline inflation in coming months, as the input costs are reflected on consumer prices.
The central bank had said inflation would peak in April, and Governor Sahap Kavcioglu told investors on Wednesday that inflation would enter a significant downward trend at the end of the third quarter or the beginning of the fourth.
Erdogan's frequent calls for rate cuts and his sacking of three central bank governors in less than two years has seriously eroded the bank's credibility. 
Erdogan said this week that he spoke to Kavcioglu and urged him to cut rates in the next two months, sending the lira tumbling to a record low against the dollar on Wednesday.
But Kavcioglu sought to ease concerns of premature easing during Wednesday's meeting with investors, saying they were ""unjustified"".

Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said the central bank has in the past begun easing policy once inflation passed its peak.
""We think that the CBRT will heed President Erdogan's recent calls for monetary easing by August,"" he said in a note. ""And as inflation drops sharply towards the end of the year, aggressive interest rate cuts seem likely.""

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business activity surged in May as the easing of some coronavirus related restrictions injected life into the bloc's dominant services industry, a survey showed, echoing data on Tuesday which showed factories had their best month on record.
An acceleration of vaccine programmes across the region and a fall in reported daily cases has allowed governments to remove some measures imposed to stop the spread of the virus.
That meant IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, jumped to 57.1 last month from April's 53.8, its highest level since February 2018. 
May's final reading was ahead of a preliminary 56.9 indication and comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index covering the service industry soared to a near three-year high of 55.2 from 50.5, just beating the 55.1 flash estimate.
""The euro zone composite and services PMIs for May came out in line with expectations and continue to show that confidence is high,"" said Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton. 
""With ongoing government support and loose policy from the ECB it should be expected that the recovery will remain robust and also fed by the pick-up in activity around the world.""
The European Central Bank will start tapering its pandemic purchases later this year but won't raise interest rates until at least 2024, according to a Reuters poll published earlier on Thursday. [ECILT/EU]
ECB chief Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday the Bank would support the euro zone ""well into"" its recovery from a pandemic-induced double dip recession.
BROAD UPTURN
Suggesting the upswing would continue, the services new business index was the highest since early 2018 the overall composite new orders reading bounced to a near record 58.4 from 53.4 - its highest since June 2006 - as pent-up demand was released.
German services returned to growth in May, helped by falling coronavirus infections and a loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, lifting overall private sector output in Europe's largest economy.
French business activity surged as an easing of the coronavirus lockdown fired up the service industry while in Spain the service sector expanded at the fastest pace since 2015. Meanwhile, Italy showed signs of recovery.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, the services sector recorded the biggest jump in activity in 24 years, after pubs and restaurants were allowed to resume serving customers indoors following months of lockdown. [GB/PMIS]
Alongside the recovery in services, euro zone manufacturing activity expanded at a record pace in May, according to a sister survey on Tuesday which suggested growth would have been even faster without supply bottlenecks that have led to an unprecedented rise in input costs. [EU/PMIM]
The euro area was expected to emerge from a double-dip recession this quarter and expand 1.5%, a Reuters poll found. 

Following a slow start, vaccination drives across the region have picked up pace and with restrictions being eased optimism about the year ahead increased. The services business expectations index rose to 71.2 from 68.4, its highest since January 2004.
""The relationship between the surveys and GDP has broken down since the pandemic began, but the strengthening activity indicators bode well nonetheless,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the services sector jumped to 52.8 from 49.9 in April.
The final composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to 56.2 in May from 55.8 in the previous month.
Both readings were in line with flash estimates released last month.
""Germany's service sector started to revive in May, buoyed by the partial easing of lockdown measures and a surge in new business as progress in the vaccine rollout helped spur confidence and demand,"" IHS economist Phil Smith said.
The survey revealed growing cost pressures in the service sector which are expected to push up overall consumer price inflation in the coming months.

""While more services firms are starting to raise prices, the full extent of the cost pressures across sector is by no means reflected in the rate of output charge inflation,"" Smith said.
Many services businesses have so far absorbed higher costs but they are now facing a rapid rebound of pent-up demand which should enable them to pass on increased costs to consumers through higher prices, he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's services sector recorded the biggest jump in activity in 24 years last month, after pubs and restaurants were allowed to resume serving customers indoors following months of lockdown, according to a closely watched business survey.
Thursday's data adds to signs that Britain is enjoying a very rapid initial rebound as lockdown rules relax.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 62.9 in May from 61.0 in April, taking it to its highest since May 1997 and above an initial estimate of 61.8.
""The latest survey results set the scene for an eye-popping rate of UK GDP growth in the second quarter of 2021, led by the reopening of customer-facing parts of the economy after winter lockdowns,"" IHS Markit's economics director, Tim Moore, said.
The composite PMI, which includes previously released manufacturing data, rose to its highest since the series began in January 1998 at 62.9, up from April's reading of 60.7.
Earlier this week the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Britain would see the fastest growth of any major economy this year. 
But the scale of Britain's economic slump last year - the biggest in over 300 years - means it will take longer than the United States, Germany or Japan for output to return to pre-crisis levels.
And the Bank of England has said initial rapid growth as the economy reopens will give few clues to the medium-term prospects for both growth and inflation, which it expects will revert to subdued pre-pandemic trends.
In the short term, however, inflation is rising sharply. The PMI showed that the biggest rise in prices charged by services businesses since the survey began in 1996 due to a jump in staffing costs, transport bills and the price of raw materials.

Staff numbers rose by the most in just over six years, as businesses brought workers back from furlough and hired new ones. Some reported staff shortages and had to raise pay offers as a result.
However, demand was very much domestically driven and the survey showed services exports fell. Businesses blamed this on a mix of COVID travel restrictions and post-Brexit restrictions on their ability to sell services in the European Union.

    The index's headline figure rose to 57.5 in May from 55.2 in April, above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.
    ""The Russian service sector posted a strong expansion in May, with rates of growth in output and new orders quickening. Although the expansion in exports waned slightly, domestic demand supported the upturn in total sales,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
    New orders rose at the quickest pace since August 2020 as greater confidence among customers boosted spending, while new export orders grew for the third month in a row.
    Cost pressures continued to mount in May, with the rate of input price inflation accelerating to the fastest since June 2008. The survey participants linked higher input prices to greater supplier charges, additional transportation fees and an increase in fuel costs.

    ""Business confidence for the year ahead was knocked midway through the second quarter, as firms expressed concerns regarding inflation and the ability of customers to pay higher prices for goods and services,"" Jones said.

Investing.com – China’s services sector grew at a slower pace in May due to decreasing overseas demand and rising input costs for businesses.
Data released earlier in the day said Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index  in May fell to 55.1, below April’s 56.3 but above the 50-mark indicating growth. The reading follows Tuesday’s release of the Caixin manufacturing PMI, which increased to 52 in May, the highest level since December 2020.
Earlier this week, official data released by the National Bureau of Statistics said the manufacturing PMI in May fell to 51, while the non-manufacturing PMI rose to 55.2.
The sector's slowdown was partly due to decreasing demand in global markets as the recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in several countries limited business activities, said the Caixin survey, adding that a gauge of export orders fell into contraction.
Although the economic recovery from COVID-19 of services sectors was slower than that of the manufacturing sector, improvement in consumption has promoted activities in China's services sector, including smaller and private firms.
Total new orders increased, and services firms hired more employees for a third consecutive month, but both at a slower pace. Input costs also rose sharply in May, while raw materials were more expensive, leading to worsening price pressures, the survey added.
""Services supply and demand continued their upward trends for the 13th consecutive month, though both expanded at a slower pace than in the previous month… inflationary pressure was enormous as price gauges continued to rise. Both the measures for input costs and the prices service providers charged rose to their highest points of the year,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release."

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.4 in May from 55.2 in April, its fastest pace of growth since January. It signalled a robust improvement in business conditions and approached the series average of 56.9.
Saudi Arabia's economy, the largest in the Arab world, is expected to grow 2.1% in 2021 after shrinking 4.1% last year amid the twin shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and lower oil prices, the IMF said in a recent report.
The output subindex, a measure of business activity, climbed to 62.0 in May from 58.7 in April, its strongest pace since late 2017. That reading, above the series average of 61.5, indicated a rapid increase in output as firms noted rising new orders and increased marketing activities.
""Most firms continued to operate with unchanged workforce numbers, suggesting a focus on boosting productivity back to pre-COVID levels. On the plus side, inventories were increased at the quickest pace in a year-and-a-half as firms prepare for a further recovery in demand over the coming months,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Saudi Arabia last month eased some health safety restrictions, allowing foreign visitors to fly in without quarantining as long as they are vaccinated against COVID-19, though 20 countries remained banned.

""After falling in each of the prior four months, the Future Output Index ticked up to indicate a slight strengthening of business expectations in May. That said, the level of optimism for the next 12 months was still far below the series average,"" the PMI report said.
While job creation expanded for a second consecutive month, it softened from April's pace and was marginal. The employment subindex had shrank in 12 of 13 months prior to the renewed expansion in April.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, edged down to 52.3 in May from 52.7 in April, remaining below the series average of 54.1.
The coronavirus crisis hit the Gulf state hard last year, both via the shock of low oil prices and the huge toll it took on vital non-oil economic sectors such as tourism.
""UAE's non-oil private sector showed further signs of improvement in May, although growth slipped marginally from April's recent high. New orders were largely supported by domestic sales, as latest data signalled a slight decrease in export orders,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
Output, a measure of business activity, also expanded for the sixth straight month, but did so at its slowest pace since February, softening to 53.6 in May from 55.4 in April. It was well below the series average of 57.3.
""Employment numbers continued to disappoint in May, falling for the fourth month in a row. With backlogs starting to rise and demand strengthening, it is hoped that businesses will start to raise their staffing levels soon to support overall growth,"" Owen said.
Employment expanded in only one of the past 17 months, in January this year. The contraction in May was marginal, however, and only roughly 1% of the firms surveyed reported job losses, the PMI report said.
""The Future Output Index continued to make steady gains in May, rising for the sixth month running and pointing to the highest degree of optimism since July 2020,"" the report said.

But only around 14% of survey respondents expected output to rise in the next 12 months, while 84% expected no change due to continued uncertainty about the pandemic's trajectory.
Last month, Dubai, one of the UAE's seven emirates and a trade and tourism hub, said it would allow people vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend events like concerts and sports events.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian auto sales have boasted their best May on record as cashed-up consumers splash out on big-ticket items, a hopeful sign spending had the resilience to weather a COVID-19 lockdown in the state of Victoria.
Some 100,809 new vehicles were sold in May, according to Thursday's data from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, a rise of 68% on last year during the depths of a pandemic recession.
Leading the pack were the pick-up trucks favoured by sole traders taking advantage of generous tax breaks, pointing to another month of robust business investment.
Government data out on Thursday showed shoppers had already been out in force in April. Retail sales climbed 1.1%, from March, putting them a huge 25% higher than last year when much of the economy was in lockdown.
The strength of consumption suggested the economy maintained its momentum from the first quarter when gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.8% to surpass its pre-pandemic levels.
""A raft of factors are supporting spending from record-low interest rates to excess savings, rising employment, the best job security levels in a decade, healthy confidence and rising wealth,"" said CommSec chief economist Craig James.
""Also the ongoing concerns about COVID-19 continue to motivate people to drive themselves from A to B, in preference to taking public transport.""
Sales likely did hit a pothole in recent days as the entire state of Victoria locked down to combat a coronavirus outbreak, effectively shutting in its 6.7 million consumers.

Yet the strength of employment is giving consumers spending power even as wages remain subdued. Some 292,000 new jobs were created in the past six months to hit a record high.
Surging home prices were also boosting household wealth. National home prices climbed 9% in the three months to May, lifting the median value of a house in Sydney by A$1,359 a day.

Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 1.0% month on month for a 7.6% year-on-year increase. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.9% month rise and a 7.3% annual gain.
Intermediate goods' prices rose the most in April against March, rising 1.8% with energy costs registering the second biggest increase of 1.0%. But in year-on-year terms, energy contributed the most, with prices surging 20.4% against April 2020 and intermediate goods up 6.9%.
Without the volatile energy, the monthly rise of producer prices was exactly as expected by economists -- 0.9% -- and only 3.5% in year-on-year terms.
Changes in producer prices are often passed on directly to consumers and Eurostat's first estimate of consumer inflation in May showed last Tuesday an acceleration to 2.0% year-on-year from 1.6% in April, also driven by surging energy costs.

The ECB wants to keep consumer price growth ""below but close to 2%"" over the medium term.
The bank has warned that the spike in energy prices will temporarily take inflation above target this year, but from next year inflation will be below target again for years to come, especially since wage growth, a necessary component of durable inflation, remains anaemic.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2021 05:30AM ET</span>",UK mortgage lending slumps in April over stamp duty uncertainty,"LONDON (Reuters) - British mortgage lending slumped in April as a government decision to prolong a tax break on property sales came too late to influence buyers that month, but housing market activity looks on course to rebound, Bank of England data showed. 
Net mortgage lending by British lenders slumped in April to 3.3 billion pounds ($4.7 billion) from a record 11.5 billion pounds the month before, an even sharper drop than the fall to 6.6 billion pounds forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
""The recent variability is likely to reflect the reduction in the stamp duty tax, which was initially expected to end in March, but has now been extended to the end of June,"" the BoE said.
Sunak announced he would extend the tax break in his March 3 budget. But many buyers were already rushing through transactions to complete them before the earlier deadline.
The cut in stamp duty land tax began in July last year to spur housing transactions after a slump at the start of the pandemic.
House prices have boomed since then, despite the economic damage wrought on other sectors by the COVID pandemic, with prices in May up 10.9% on a year ago according to lender Nationwide, the biggest jump since 2014.
Another key factor pushing up prices has been greater demand for spacious housing outside city centres from people who are now able to work from home.
Mortgage approvals - which adjusted faster than lending to the tax change - rose to 86,921 in April from 83,402 in March, though they are below November's high of more than 103,000.
Households continued to pay down personal debt, largely reflecting reduced spending opportunities during the lockdown, which was still largely in place in April.

Net repayments totalled 377 million pounds, well below economists' average forecast for a net 500 million pounds in new borrowing. April's net consumer lending was 5.7% below its year-ago level, compared with an 8.8% shortfall in March.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's economy raced ahead last quarter as consumers and businesses spent with abandon, lifting output back above where it was last year when pandemic lockdowns tipped the country into its first recession in three decades.
The economy expanded by a real 1.8% in the three months to March, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed on Wednesday. Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast a 1.5% rise following an upwardly revised 3.2% gain in the fourth quarter.
The solid back-to-back quarterly growth helped annual output climb 1.1% to A$525.7 billion ($408.05 billion), a major turnaround from last year's recession low of $468.3 billion.
The better-than-forecast figures pushed Australia's benchmark share index to record highs while supporting the local dollar near a one-week top. 
Australia is in rare company here with only five other countries boasting an economy that’s larger than before the pandemic, said Kristian Kolding, a partner at Deloitte Access Economics. 
On average, Australia's rich world peers are 2.7% smaller than they were before the pandemic, Deloitte's research found, with the United Kingdom shrinking almost 9%, the European Union contracting by 5% and the United States 1% smaller.
Australia announced strict social distancing rules in late-March 2020 to curb the coronavirus pandemic, forcing businesses from retailers to cafes and restaurants to down shutters while leading hundreds of thousands to queue up for welfare payments.
But the A$2 trillion economy has since staged a remarkable comeback by keeping virus numbers in check which has allowed businesses to reopen with confidence. Hefty and timely monetary and fiscal stimulus have been beneficial too. 
""Today’s numbers show Australia’s recovery is becoming more broad-based,"" Deloitte's Kolding said. 
""Families are spending locally, and businesses continue to invest, making the most of record low interest rates and tax offsets,"" Kolding added.
Wednesday's data showed the first-quarter expansion was driven by private investment which contributed 0.9 percentage points to growth with machinery and equipment investment clocking its strongest quarterly rise since December 2009. 
A surge in dwelling activity also helped while household spending added 0.7 percentage points to growth. 
""Underpinning all of that is continued strength in jobs numbers,"" Kolding added.
OUTLOOK CAUTIOUS
Australia's employment is higher than before the pandemic while measures of underemployment and unemployment have slipped rapidly though they are still above levels the country's central bank believes is needed to spark wage pressures. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has welcomed recent strength in data but has reiterated it will not raise the cash rate from its record low of 0.1% until inflation was sustainably within its 2-3% target band.
For that to occur, the RBA says the jobless rate will need to fall to or below 4% from 5.5% currently and wage growth will have to double to at least 3%, conditions the central bank believes are unlikely to be met before 2024 at the earliest. 
Analysts were circumspect about the outlook given slow COVID-19 vaccine rollout across the nation and an extension of a seven-day lockdown in Australia's second-most populous city Melbourne by another week to stop a rapidly-spreading coronavirus strain.
""This lockdown will be the first lengthy one without JobKeeper so we need to be a bit more cautious about how the recovery may look,"" ANZ economists wrote in a note, referring to a government welfare payment.
Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Wednesday hinted at some fiscal support for Victoria, which has been under lockdown since last week. A lockdown in the capital city Melbourne has been extended, while some restrictions will persist elsewhere in the southern eastern state.

KPMG economists say the lockdown is costing the Victorian economy A$125 million a day.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's consumer inflation accelerated to a more than nine-year high in May, reinforcing calls for gradual monetary tightening, though the increase was mainly due to a low base effect and rises in oil and agricultural prices.
Consumer prices rose 2.6% in May from a year earlier, government data showed on Wednesday, logging the fastest growth since April 2012 and matching a median estimate for a 2.6% increase in a Reuters survey. It grew 2.3% in April.
In May 2020, South Korea fell into deflation as the coronavirus pandemic struck demand and supply chains.
The country's finance minister said that the impact from the low base and temporary supply disruptions for some agricultural products and oil prices will ease going forward.
""The government will prepare against the inflation risk from materialising, prevent excessive inflation expectations and take measures to stabilise living costs,"" Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said.
Wednesday's data showed the cost of agricultural, livestock and fisheries products and petroleum surged 12.1% and 23.3%, respectively.
Core CPI, which excluded volatile energy and food prices, came at 1.2% year-on-year, posting the sharpest increase since November 2018.
Month-on-month inflation was 0.1%, slower than a 0.2% increase in April.
Last week, the central bank kept its base rate at a record low of 0.50%, but upgraded its economic outlook and projected high consumer inflation.
The bank's governor said it is preparing to pull back on the extraordinary stimulus extended during the pandemic in the face of accelerating inflation and a build-up of dangerous imbalances.
""Although the central bank's policy messaging has turned more hawkish recently, clear signs that COVID-19-related risks are fading are likely to be a prerequisite for policy tightening,"" ANZ Research said in a note.

""Our base case is for the Bank of Korea to kick-off policy normalisation in the first quarter of 2022 ... we acknowledge that a faster-than-anticipated pace of vaccination could pave the way for the first rate hike to come as soon as the fourth quarter of 2021.""
The BOK currently sees inflation standing at 1.8% for the whole of 2021 and 1.4% for 2022.

Gross domestic product advanced 1.8% from the final quarter of 2020, when it rose a revised 3.2%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney Wednesday. Economists had forecast a first-quarter gain of 1.5%. From a year earlier, the economy expanded 1.1 % vs an estimated 0.6% increase.
“The economic recovery in Australia is stronger than earlier expected and is forecast to continue,” Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said Tuesday after keeping stimulatory policy settings in place. It’s being supported by “fiscal measures and very accommodative financial conditions,” he said.
Australia’s rapid rebound has been underpinned by its ability to limit Covid-19 to isolated flare ups, boosting consumer and business confidence. A massive fiscal-monetary injection strengthened the financial position of households and firms during the lockdown, and consumers are now spending savings built up.
“Australian economic activity has recovered to be above pre-pandemic levels,” Michael Smedes, head of National Accounts at the ABS, said in a statement. “Machinery and equipment investment recorded its strongest quarterly rise since December 2009, driven by the continued improvement in business confidence and support from government tax incentives.”
The Australian dollar was little changed after the release, trading at 77.68 U.S. cents at 11:50 a.m. in Sydney.
Today’s report showed:
Unemployment in Australia has steadily declined as the recovery gathered pace, reaching 5.5% in April from a pandemic peak of 7.4%.
Some pandemic support has now been withdrawn, such as loan repayment deferrals and the government’s JobKeeper wage subsidy that expired just before the end of the first quarter. Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy said in testimony Tuesday that partial data showed around 56,000 workers had lost their jobs in the four weeks following the conclusion of JobKeeper on March 28.
A potential risk to the outlook is Australia’s sluggish rollout of a Covid vaccine, which has been heightened by a renewed outbreak of the virus in Melbourne that prompted a weeklong lockdown in the nation’s second-largest city.
“An important ongoing source of uncertainty is the possibility of significant outbreaks of the virus, although this should diminish as more of the population is vaccinated,” Lowe said yesterday.
Australia’s government and central bank have worked closely to support the economy through the pandemic. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg unveiled further stimulus measures in his May budget, joining forces with Lowe in trying to push the economy to maximum employment and revive sluggish inflation.
The central bank is due to decide next month on rolling over its yield target to a later maturity and whether to extend its quantitative easing program.

Inflation from a year earlier reached 2.6% from April’s 2.3%, data from the statistics office showed Wednesday. Economists had also expected consumer prices to rise 2.6%.
Inflation is rising globally as surging commodity costs feed into higher consumer prices and trigger debates about when central banks might start to raise interest rates again. For the Bank of Korea, faster price gains also reflect a broadening economic recovery that adds pressure on the bank to normalize monetary policy.
The reading marks the second straight month the headline inflation exceeded the central bank’s 2% target. The rise was partly buoyed by the negative reading in May 2020.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 02:41PM ET</span>",Brazil posts May trade surplus of $9.3 billion as exports hit historic high,"By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted a trade surplus of $9.3 billion in May, Economy Ministry figures showed on Tuesday, as record exports for that month helped fuel the second largest overall surplus ever.
The $9.3 billion surplus was almost exactly in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for a $9.2 billion surplus, and up almost 30% from the $6.8 billion surplus in May last year.
It is the second highest on record following April's $10.3 billion surplus, Refinitiv figures show, meaning the April-June surplus will almost certainly be the highest quarterly surplus on record.
Exports in May totaled a record $26.95 billion for that month and imports were $17.7 billion, the ministry said, adding that total trade flows of $44.6 billion in the month were up 50% from a year earlier.
These figures mean Brazil's trade surplus in the first five months of the year totaled $27.5 billion, sharply up from the $15.8 billion surplus a year ago.

Exports in the January-May period totaled $109.1 billion, up 31% on the year, while imports of $81.5 billion were 21% higher than a year ago, ministry figures showed.
Economy Ministry officials have said the 2021 surplus could reach a record of almost $90 billion, and the central bank is forecasting a $70 billion surplus this year. Both would be significantly higher than last year's $53 billion.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index slipped to 47.6 in May from 48.4 in April, remaining below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction. The index has been clawing its way higher gradually after plummeting to 35.0 in April 2020, by far the lowest reading in the survey's 10-year history.
""PMI data for May suggested that Mexican manufacturers continued to struggle, with new orders again undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
Factories in Mexico operated below capacity again in May, with goods producers reporting reduced working hours and the termination of temporary employment as sales remained weak, De Lima said.
Mexico's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 4.7% in April from 4.4% in March, the national statistics agency said on Thursday.
De Lima said that ""adding to the challenges faced by manufacturers were rising input prices as raw material shortages pushed up cost burdens.""
A Bank of Mexico board member said on Wednesday that inflation, which stood at 5.80% in the year through the first half of May, has risen partly because of a low base of comparison and that some inflationary pressures are coming from higher costs and prices of raw materials.

On a positive note in May companies were more upbeat towards the year-ahead outlook for production. 
""Optimism was, however, pinned on hopes that the COVID-19 pandemic will be brought under control,"" said De Lima.

290,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 01:41PM ET</span>",Chile's economy posts record year-over-year growth in April aided by weak comparison,"SANTIAGO(Reuters) -Chile's economic activity soared a record 14.1% in April, the central bank said on Tuesday, with growth magnified by a weak comparative figure in the previous year and early signs of recovery from months of coronavirus-induced stagnation. The bank's monthly IMACEC economic activity index encompasses about 90% of the economy tallied in gross domestic product figures.
Economic activity dropped 1.4% versus March, however, as much of the South American nation was locked down in April amid a fierce second wave of contagions that followed the southern hemisphere summer.
Commercial activity nonetheless soared 33.1% in April versus the previous year, while services jumped 16.3%. The production of goods rose 3.8%, mainly supported by manufacturing, the bank said. 
""This result was explained, in part, by a greater adaptation of homes and companies to the health emergency associated with COVID-19,"" the bank said.
In April last year, economic activity had plunged 13.8% year-on-year as the Chilean government moved early to stave off the fast-spreading virus.
Finance Minister Rodrigo Cerda said demand had recovered well despite the lingering pandemic, but also highlighted other signs of a longer-term uptick in growth.
""Imports of capital goods, a key indicator for investment, also continue to expand at very high rates, leading us to believe we have new momentum that will allow us to maintain high growth,"" he added.
Scotiabank said in a note that the strong April numbers supported revising upwards the Central Bank's official estimate for full-year 2021 growth, from a range of 6-7% to 7-8%.

Scotiabank did, however, note that rising cases in recent days in Chile were reason for ""caution"" in the short-term.
Chile is among the world leaders in vaccination against COVID-19, but cases have soared among the country's youth, who have yet to be vaccinated, once again raising the specter of renewed lockdowns.

The paper looked at 26 labor market measures that typically move in tandem and found that during the current recovery they are giving wildly divergent signals about the health of the job market.
The job openings rate, for instance, suggests the job market is much tighter than the unemployment rate; the labor force participation rate points to much more slack than detected in the unemployment rate.
Because the pandemic has forced so many people out of the workforce, ""negative signals such as the low labor force participation rate provide a better read than do the positive signals,"" the researchers argued. ""Overall, our findings reveal that the labor market situation is worse than some headline numbers suggest.""
U.S. central bankers are debating how tight the U.S. labor market has become amid widespread reports from employers about hiring difficulties even as the economy still has 8 million fewer people working than before the pandemic. 

The question matters because the Fed says it could start reducing its support for the economy once inflation and the labor market have made ""substantial further progress"" toward the Fed's goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment. It hasn't, however, laid out exactly how it will measure that progress. 
The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.1% in April and a reading for May is due out on Friday.

292,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 01:25PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing gains steam; raw material, labor shortages mounting","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity picked up in May as pent-up demand amid a reopening economy boosted orders, but unfinished work piled up because of shortages of raw materials and labor.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey on Tuesday found companies and their suppliers ""continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand,"" noting that ""record-long lead times, wide-scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products are continuing to affect all segments"" of manufacturing. 
According to the ISM, worker absenteeism and short-term shutdowns because of shortages of parts and workers continued to limit manufacturing's growth potential. 
""Strong demand is a good problem to have, but that demand is increasingly straining manufacturers' ability to keep pace,"" said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
The ISM's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 61.2 last month from 60.7 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 60.9 in May. 
Graphic: ISM PMI - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qmypmzoaqvr/ismpmi.png 
A shift in demand to goods from services as the COVID-19 pandemic kept Americans at home strained supply chains, with the virus also disrupting labor at manufacturers and their suppliers, leading to raw material shortages across industries. 
More than half of adults in the United States are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing authorities to lift pandemic-related restrictions on businesses. That is whipping up demand across the economy, as is massive fiscal stimulus. There is no sign the supply bottlenecks are easing, even as demand is reverting back to services.
Sixteen manufacturing industries, including furniture, machinery, transportation equipment, computer and electronic products, and electrical equipment, appliances and components reported growth last month. Only the printing and related support activities industry reported a contraction.
In the computer and electronic products industry, manufacturers complained about poor supplier performance, adding that ""demand is high, and we are struggling to find employees to help us keep up."" Similar complaints were echoed across other industries. Food, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers said ""delays at the port continue to strain inventory levels.""
Makers of fabricated metal products reported they did not expect the supply chain constraints to improve ""until possibly the fourth quarter of 2021 or beyond.""
Supply challenges are likely holding back the construction sector, with spending on projects rising only 0.2% in April after surging 1.0% in March, a separate report from the Commerce Department showed. 
Graphic: Construction spending - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/bdwvkxdzkpm/constspend.png 
U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the benchmark S&P 500 just shy of its record peak. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S Treasury prices were lower.
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME DEMAND BOOM
The survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index jumped to 67.0 from a reading of 64.3 in April. Inventories at factories are barely growing and business warehouses are almost empty. 
A measure of factory employment dropped to a six-month low. According to the ISM, ""an overwhelming majority"" of companies are hiring or attempting to hire, ""with more than 50% of them expressing difficulty in doing so."" 
Labor is scarce despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed. Generous unemployment benefits funded by the government, problems with child care and fears of contracting the virus, even with vaccines widely accessible, as well as pandemic-related retirements have been blamed for keeping workers home.
Lack of workers and shortages of raw materials such as semiconductors used in the production of motor vehicles and electronic goods led to a further increase in backlogs of uncompleted work. 
Suppliers took much longer to deliver to manufacturers last month, with the supplier deliveries index jumping to 78.8. That was the highest reading since April 1974 and followed 75 in April. A reading above 50 suggests slower deliveries. With constraints mounting, production at factories grew at its slowest pace since last June.
""This has to be infuriating for factories seeing a once-in-a-lifetime demand surge but are unable to take full advantage of it for lack of parts,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The shortages are also keeping input prices elevated, fanning inflation. The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers hovered near levels last seen in July 2008, when the economy was in the throes of the Great Recession. 
The government reported on Friday that a measure of underlying inflation tracked by the Federal Reserve for its 2% target accelerated 3.1% on a year-on-year basis in April, the biggest increase since July 1992. 
Most economists and Fed Chair Jerome Powell maintain that higher inflation will be transitory.
There are concerns that persistently higher commodity prices could squeeze profit margins, though lower inventories give businesses ample pricing power. The slowdown in hiring at factories last month could temper expectations for an acceleration in job growth in May after nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 in April. 

According to an early Reuters survey of economists, payrolls likely increased by 664,000 jobs last month. The government is due to publish May's employment report on Friday.
""We doubt these labor supply constraints will ease significantly before September and could hold back payrolls growth again this Friday,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.

293,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>","Brazil economy rebounds to pre-pandemic level, pointing to brighter 2021","By Jamie McGeever
BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazil's economy grew by 1.2% in the first quarter, data showed on Tuesday, faster than economists had expected, as rebounding services and investments took Latin America's largest economy back to is size at the end of 2019, before the pandemic hit.
It was the third consecutive quarter of growth. While the rebound has slowed, underlying figures suggest strong foundations for a continued recovery, prompting upward revisions to full-year forecasts and a surge in Brazil's currency.
""This makes the outlook for the coming quarters very positive,"" said Jason Vieira, chief economist at Infinity Asset Management in Sao Paulo, calling the data ""a really good set of numbers, especially fixed business investment."" 
Brazil's real rose to 5.15 per dollar, on track to close at its strongest this year. It is up 0.5% since Dec. 31, a sharp rebound since being down more than 10% year-to-date against the dollar in March.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said growth this year will likely be ""very strong"", and economists at Citi and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) jacked up their 2021 gross domestic product growth forecasts to 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. 
""We expect the economy to recover visibly in coming quarters in tandem with further progress on the Covid vaccination front, gradual reopening of the economy, renewed fiscal stimulus, (and) recovering consumer and business confidence,"" Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs said.
Brazil's economic recovery has also helped accelerate inflation, prompting aggressive interest rate hikes. The central bank has raised its benchmark Selic rate by 75 basis points at each of its last two policy meetings, to 3.50%, and has indicated it will do so again next month.
Brazil's first-quarter growth was driven by services, industry and fixed business investment, official statistics agency IBGE figures showed. Agriculture grew by 5.7% in the quarter, its fastest pace in four years.
Government spending fell and manufacturing contracted. Household consumption fell less than expected, according to Vieira at Infinity, and is expected to stay surprisingly strong for the rest of the year.
The 1.2% growth rate in the January-March period from the previous three months was more than the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists for 1.0% growth. 
The range of forecasts from 27 economists was wide, indicating difficulty in assessing the impact of the end of emergency government aid payments to the poor on Dec. 31 and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic's second wave.
Industry expanded by 0.7%, the dominant services sector grew 0.4% and fixed business investment rose 4.6% in the quarter, IBGE said.
Household consumption slipped 0.1% and government spending fell 0.8%, one of the biggest quarterly declines in years. Within industry output, the manufacturing sector shrank by 0.5%.
Compared with the same period a year earlier, GDP grew by 1.0%, IBGE figures showed, also more than the 0.8% rise forecast in a Reuters poll. 

IBGE figures show economic activity is back to its pre-pandemic level at the end of 2019 but still 3.1% below its peak in 2014.
Economists warned, however, that tight fiscal policy, rising interest rates and continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and government's economic reform agenda were risks that point to much more subdued growth next year.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy is on track to register ""very strong"" growth this year, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said on Tuesday, as the accelerated roll out of COVID-19 vaccinations and protocols help the economy build on its solid performance in the first quarter.
Guedes was speaking after figures showed that Latin America's largest economy grew faster than expected in the January-March period on a quarterly and year-on-year basis, taking it back to its pre-pandemic size in 2019.
Guedes told a lower house education commission that the economy had been growing perhaps as much as 2.5% in the first quarter of last year before the pandemic struck. 
""So if we are growing faster than the first quarter of last year ... it is possible that we are actually growing at much higher rates,"" he said, adding that the 1.2% quarterly pace of expansion in the first quarter bodes well for the year.
The Economy Ministry said that high frequency indicators show the recovery is continuing but warned that the drought affecting the country, one of the worst in decades, could hamper electricity supply and ultimately wider economic activity.
In a statement, the ministry also said that the strength of first quarter growth figures vindicates the government's cautious fiscal stance, and repeated its view that fiscal consolidation, debt reduction and pro-market reforms are fundamental to Brazil's long-term growth prospects.

In the near term, the main positive factors supporting activity are a favorable global scenario, a strong rebound in investment led by the private sector, increased savings, credit growth and job creation as social distancing measures ease, the ministry said.
On the flip side, the main factors that warrant close attention are political risks surrounding the need to continue fiscal austerity and approve economic reforms, uncertainties related to the pandemic, and the nationwide drought, it added.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel plans to open an economic attache office in Abu Dhabi this summer to attract foreign investment and boost economic relations with Gulf states and the broader Arab world, the Economy Ministry said on Tuesday.
This follows a U.S.-brokered normalisation of ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last September that has led to a number of bilateral banking deals and direct flights between the two countries.
On Monday, an Emirati embassy opened in Tel Aviv while Israel's Finance Ministry said Israel and the United Arab Emirates signed a tax treaty to spur business development between the countries.
Economy Minister Amir Peretz said he saw ""enormous economic potential"" in strengthening Israeli-Emirati relations.
""Opening the economic attache office will give a significant boost to the various initiatives already underway,"" Peretz added.
Israel's Foreign Trade Administration (FTA), a part of the Economy Ministry, operates in more than 50 business centers around the world. It opened a branch in Manila last year.
Aviad Tamir will be the economic attache in the UAE, the ministry said.
The FTA last year identified significant economic potential for Israel's economy from relations with the UAE, including strengthening aviation ties between Israel and the Gulf, oil imports, energy solutions, diamond exports, exports of medical equipment water technologies, and exports of financial and cyber security technologies.

The new branches in the UAE ""will yield significant returns in light of the great interest arising from Emirates interested in a long line of Israeli technologies as well as in light of the large capital in the UAE that may be translated into significant investments in Israeli economy and industry,"" said FTA director Ohad Cohen. 
Israel has also recently normalised relations with Bahrain.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy likely contracted in April, the first decline in a year, due to widespread lockdowns amid a third wave of coronavirus infections, slowing the country's march toward recovery, data showed on Tuesday.
In a preliminary estimate, Statistics Canada said the economy contracted 0.8% in April. By contrast, real GDP had grown 11 months in a row through March, when it grew 1.1%.
Economists said the April decline was largely expected and is unlikely to change the Bank of Canada's outlook for interest rate hikes. 
""They were talking about the output gap and inflation getting back to target by late 2022. That's still a long way from here,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
The Bank of Canada last month signaled rates could begin to rise in 2022, noting the economy had rebounded more quickly than it had expected.
The Canadian economy grew 5.6% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, as restrictions were eased between the second and third waves of COVID-19, and buoyed by strong housing investment and more mortgage debt. The gain missed analyst expectations of 6.7%. 
Still, the economy is in a good position to hit the Bank of Canada's GDP forecast of 6.5% for the year, said economists, meaning it will likely ease some stimulus this year.
""I think the Bank of Canada is going to regard this as roughly in line with their forecast,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. 
""It's going to leave us on track for more tapering in July, and in October, and ultimately going to no more QE (quantitative easing) once we get to 2022.""

Many Canadian provinces imposed strict public health measures and closed many non-essential business in April amid a harsh third wave of COVID-19 infections. With April's contraction, economic activity was likely about 2% below pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. 
The Canadian dollar steadied at about near 1.2030 per U.S. dollar, or 83.13 U.S. cents, up 0.3% on the day.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending rose 0.2% after surging 1.0% in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.5%. Construction spending, which accounts for about 4% of gross domestic product, jumped 9.8% on a year-on-year basis in April.
Spending on private construction projects rose 0.4%, lifted by investment in single-family homebuilding. Demand for housing remains robust, though expensive building materials, especially lumber, are constraining builders' ability to ramp up construction. 
The government reported last month a plunge in homebuilding in April, with the number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started increasing to the highest level since 1999.
Outlays on residential projects increased 1.0% in April. Spending on private nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling dropped 0.5% in April. 

Business investment in nonresidential structures fell in the first quarter for the sixth straight quarter as a rebound in mining exploration, shafts and wells was offset by a drop in commercial and healthcare buildings.
Spending on public construction projects fell 0.6% in April. State and local government outlays slipped 0.2%, while federal government spending declined 6.2%.

298,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation jumps past ECB target in May,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Euro zone inflation surged past the European Central Bank's elusive target in May, heightening a communications challenge for policymakers who will happily live with higher prices for now but may face a backlash from irate consumers. 
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro accelerated to 2% in May from 1.6% in April, driven by higher energy costs to its fastest rate since late 2018 and above the ECB's aim of ""below but close to 2%"", data from Eurostat showed on Tuesday.
The figure is also above expectations for 1.9% in a Reuters poll, likely intensifying talk that structural forces, not just transient factors, may be behind a surge.
""Everyone saw it coming, but still it is starting to make a lot of people sweat,"" ING economist Bert Colijn said. ""Inflation is returning rapidly at the moment at a time when news about economies is increasingly upbeat and labour markets are profiting from the reopening.""
May is unlikely to be the peak, however. Inflation could be closer to 2.5% late in the year as the recovery from a pandemic-induced double-dip recession and recent commodity price increases add to price pressures. 
Still, getting through this period is more a communications exercise for the ECB. The bank has already made clear that this is not the sort of inflation it is looking for after nearly a decade of undershooting its target, so policy will remain loose for years to come.
For one, the surge in inflation is temporary, even the most conservative policymakers argue. The drivers of price growth will fade early next year and inflation will be below target for years to come, especially since wage growth, a necessary component of durable inflation, remains anaemic. 
Although unemployment fell to 8% in April from 8.1% in March, according to separate data, it remains well above the pre-crisis rate and government subsidies still likely keep it artificially low. 
Higher oil prices also mask weak underlying trends and inflation for services and durable goods, more meaningful measures for central bankers, remains weak, rate setters argue. 
Indeed, core inflation, or prices excluding volatile food and energy costs, only picked up to 0.9% from 0.8%. A more narrow measure, which excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, rose to 0.9% from 0.7%. 
ECB policy is also ineffective against short-term price movements, providing yet another reason for the bank to look past this year's surge.

All this supports arguments for the ECB to keep policy ultra easy when rate setters next meet on June 10, even if they face a potential public backlash, especially in Germany, where inflation will exceed 3% later this year as a tax hike and statistical effects add to price pressures.
Already the biggest critics of ECB policy, some conservative Germans fear that the central bank is excessively complacent about inflation and its easy money policy could herald a new period of higher prices.

299,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>","Euro zone factory growth, input costs hit record highs in May: PMI","LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing activity expanded at a record pace in May, according to a survey on Tuesday which suggested growth would have been even faster without supply bottlenecks that have led to an unprecedented rise in input costs.
The bloc's economy has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic over the past year, with governments forcing much of the region's dominant service industry to close. But factories largely remained open, and restrictions in various countries have gradually been eased.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 63.1 in May from April's 62.9, above an initial 62.8 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday and is seen as a good guide to economic health, eased from April's 63.2 to 62.2. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""Surging output growth adds to signs that the economy is rebounding strongly in the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""However, May also saw record supply delays, which are constraining output growth and leaving firms unable to meet demand to a degree not previously witnessed by the survey.""
Disruptions caused by the global coronavirus pandemic are still having a huge impact on supply chains, making it a sellers' market for the raw materials that factories need.
The input prices index soared to 87.1 from April's 82.2, easily the highest reading on record, and while factories passed on those costs at the fastest pace in the survey's history, some of the burden was absorbed by manufacturers.
Still, inflationary pressures might be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who have not managed to get inflation anywhere near their goal despite years of ultra-loose monetary policy.
The euro area was expected to emerge from a double-dip recession this quarter, a Reuters poll found, but a projected rise in price pressures this year was not expected to be sustainable, with inflation forecast to ease substantially. [ECILT/EU]
""We expect price pressures to moderate as the disruptive effects of the pandemic ease further in coming months and global supply chains improve,"" Williamson said.

Struggling to get the materials they need to meet booming demand - or not wanting to pay the price, factories built up backlogs of work at a rate not seen in the survey's history.
After a slow start, vaccine programmes are accelerating in the euro zone so optimism remained high and factories increased headcount at one of the fastest rates since the survey began.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Factory activity powered ahead in Europe last month and stayed strong in Asia as demand grew, surveys showed, but rising raw material costs and supply bottlenecks posed a headache for business and weighed on the recovery in export-driven economies.
European manufacturers ramped up activity at the fastest monthly pace in PMI survey history but a spike in COVID-19 infections in some countries continued to disrupt supply chains.
Euro zone manufacturing activity would have been even faster without those constraints, but IHS Markit's final euro zone manufacturing PMI still rose to 63.1 in May from April's 62.9. [EUR/PMIM]
That was above an initial 62.8 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
In Britain, a deluge of new orders helped drive a record increase in factory growth, and its IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 65.6, the highest since the survey started in 1992. [GB/PMIM]
""The business surveys continue to suggest the economy, and particularly the manufacturing sector, is going gangbusters, and are consistent with our view that the recovery will be very strong in Q2 and the second half of the year,"" said Andrew Kennigham at Capital Economics.
""That said, the hard data may come in a bit less strong than the surveys imply, not least due to the evident supply bottlenecks."" 
The euro area was expected to emerge from a double-dip recession this quarter, a Reuters poll found, but a projected rise in price pressures this year was not expected to be sustainable, with inflation forecast to ease substantially. [ECILT/EU]
Disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic are having a huge impact on supply chains, making it a sellers' market for the raw materials that factories need, and leading to huge increases in input costs.
""Supply shortages will lead to some upward pressure on inflation but it will not be huge and will be short-lived,"" Kenningham added. 
In the euro zone, the input prices index was easily the highest reading on record and official data on Tuesday showed inflation surged past the European Central Bank's target of just below 2% last month.
INDIA SLUMP 
China's factory activity meanwhile expanded at the fastest pace this year on solid demand at home and overseas, sharp rises in input prices there and strains in supply chains crimped some firms' production.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI, which focuses on smaller firms, rose to 52.0 last month, the highest since December and inching up from April's 51.9.
China's official PMI on Monday showed factory activity in the world's second-largest economy slowed slightly in May on surging raw material costs.
Factory activity in Japan and South Korea moderated in May, underscoring the fragile nature of their recoveries.
""A spread of new (COVID) variants is already having a negative impact on supply chains. If this situation persists, it would hit Asian manufacturers that had been scrambling to diversify supply chains out of China,"" said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Asia's recovery has been driven more by external than domestic demand. If companies have trouble exporting enough goods, that bodes ill for the region's economies."" 
The effects of surging infections on manufacturing were most prominent in India, where factory activity growth slowed to its weakest in 10 months, the PMI for the country showed.
India's coronavirus outbreak has infected 28 million, killed more than 300,000 and forced many states to impose restrictions on economic activity.
Factories in Taiwan and Vietnam were so far holding up despite rising infections there. 
Japan's au Jibun Bank PMI dropped in May as a global chip shortage and supply chain disruptions hit car production, causing output growth to miss expectations in April.

South Korea's PMI slowed from April and although growth extended into an eighth straight month the pace of input price increases hit a 13-year high.
The recovery in Asia's fourth-largest economy remained robust with South Korean exports logging their sharpest expansion in 32 years in May, fuelled by stronger consumer demand globally as many economies start to reopen.

The number of cities that reported monthly price rises picked up to 80 in May from 77 in April, with small cities in the Yangtze River Delta showing the greatest strength.
""The volume of new residential home projects supplied by developers remained elevated in May,"" said China Index Academy Research Director Cao Jingjing. 
Cao added property owners looking it buy a larger home have led demand for new projects, fuelling price gains.
Prices of second-hand homes rose 0.5% in May from previous month, unchanged from the pace in April. Existing home prices in tier-1 cities ticked up 0.95% on-month in May, with the pace more than doubling the average growth in other lower tier cities. 
Separately，a private survey published on Tuesday showed that China's average home rental prices in large and medium-sized cities in May rose 0.78% month-on-month, the biggest increase since January 2019.
Against a year ago, rents fell 0.61% in May, the smallest decline since May 2020, as a vast number of college graduates led to a surge in rental demand, the Chinese property data provider Zhuge House Hunter said. 
Chinese authorities have since this year intensified their campaign to rein in the relentless rise in home prices and drive speculators out of the market. Local policies include capping prices set by developers and preventing some real estate agencies from setting excessively high second-hand home prices. Banks in major cities also hiked mortgage rates.

Transactions in 18 major cities tracked by the institute remained flat in May compared with April, with tier-1 cities logging 20% drop while tier-3 towns seeing 33% rise.
Land sales by volume in 300 cities fell 12% in May from April, and declined 19% on an annual basis, CIA data showed.

304,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",New orders drive record surge in UK manufacturing in May - PMI,"LONDON (Reuters) - A deluge of new orders helped to drive a record increase in British manufacturing activity last month as the economy began to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 65.6 in May from 60.9 in April. While a little lower than the preliminary ""flash"" reading of 66.1, it still marked the highest since the survey started in 1992.
The index levels represent the pace and breadth of growth rather than the amount of output, however, and the sector likely has some way to go to get back to where it was before the lockdown.
The survey's gauges of growth in new orders and employment also hit record highs, although so too did the measure of input cost inflation paid by factories for goods as they cited poor harvests, port disruption and Brexit.
Price pressures are on the radar of the Bank of England, though the central bank has said it is likely to look through price rises caused by short-term disruptions.
The BoE said last month that the world's fifth-biggest economy was on course to grow by 7.25% in 2021, its fastest since World War Two, after a near 10% contraction last year.

Tuesday's survey showed that export orders increased at the fastest rate on record, although survey compiler IHS Markit said this was driven mainly by larger companies, with smaller manufacturers seeing less demand.
PMIs for the services and construction sectors are due on Wednesday and Thursday.

The surprisingly solid job market data is supporting expectations for a consumer-driven recovery over the summer months as households are ready to splash out after months of limited possibilities to spend due to COVID-19 restrictions.
The Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 15,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.739 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 9,000.
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate remained unchanged at 6% for the fifth consecutive month.

""There are first signs of a comprehensive improvement on the labour market in May. The impact of the coronavirus crisis is still visible very clearly, but it is becoming a bit smaller,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said.
In a further positive sign, the number of employees put on reduced working hours in job protection schemes, also known as Kurzarbeit, fell sharply in May, preliminary figures showed.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, reached 64.4, below March's record high 66.6 but up from a flash reading of 64.0. The index stood at 66.2 in April.
Factories in Europe's biggest economy have been humming along during the pandemic almost undisturbed by lockdowns that have impacted the services sector. Activity accelerated early this year on strong demand from the United States and China.
But supply shortages and rising costs pose a growing threat, the survey compilers said.
""The disruption from supply shortages has continued to spread, with now almost four-in-five manufacturers reporting increased lead times on inputs and a growing number also citing an impact on output and new orders due to forced downtime,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.
""The disruption to supply comes hand in hand with a further surge in cost pressures, with 90% of manufacturers – far more than ever before in the survey's 25-year history – reporting increased input prices in May,"" he added. 

""Strong demand fundamentals mean that manufacturers are able to pass on some of the burden of higher costs through unprecedented price increases of their own.""
The survey also found that activity expectations for the year ahead remained close to record high levels and manufacturers were hiring at a faster pace to meet rising demand.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index rose to 59.4 from 58.9 in April, hitting the highest level since September 2000.
That was even slightly better than a preliminary reading of 59.2 and took the index further above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
Manufacturers ramped up production a notch as the country emerged from its third national lockdown in the middle of the month, with backlogs at their highest point since November 2006.

""The key challenge now for firms is being able to keep up with workloads,"" IHS Markit economics director Andrew Harker said.
""This is proving to be a struggle amid severe supply-chain delays and a lack of material availability. As a result, levels of backlogged work are rising sharply,"" he added.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 03:50AM ET</span>",Growth in China home prices to sustain momentum in 2021,"By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's home prices are expected to grow faster this year than anticipated a few months earlier fuelled by hot demand in major cities and easy liquidity, despite Beijing's heightened cooling measures, a Reuters poll showed.
As China's economy recovers from the COVID-19 shock, authorities have stepped up curbs on the property sector to guard against financial risks as concerns mount over speculative behaviour in some parts of the market. Home prices, however, extended a rising streak in recent months with heat spilling over into some smaller towns from metropolises.
Average residential property price growth is estimated to grow 5% in 2021, according to 11 analysts and economists surveyed by Reuters.
The forecast topped a 3.3% gain tipped in a February survey, and slightly higher than around 4.9% gain in 2020. Home prices are seen slowing to 3% in the first half of 2022.
Despite stepped-up market restrictions, prices are on a rising trajectory, said Huang Yu, vice president of China Index Academy, a Beijing-based property research institute. Climbing land prices are also expected to buoy housing prices, she said.
Zhao Ke, analyst at China Merchants Securities, said muted prices in tier-3 and 4 cities were likely to drag down overall gains.
Chinese authorities have since this year intensified their efforts to rein in the relentless rise in home prices and drive speculators out of the market. Local policies include capping prices set by developers and preventing some real estate agencies from setting excessively high second-hand home prices. Banks in major cities also hiked mortgage rates.
Property sales volume is expected to be flat from last year, unchanged from the previous poll, and versus a 2.6% gain in 2020.
Housing investments are estimated to rise 7% this year, in line with the pace in 2020, and marginally higher than 6.4% in the February poll. 
""We expect new construction investment to revive in the third quarter on fast work resumption and rising raw material prices,"" China Merchants Securities' Zhao said.
""Home project construction investment will be the major pillar of overall property investment, which will also be likely driven by rental housing construction,"" China Index Academy's Huang said. 
Most survey respondents forecast it will take a long time before China enacts broad property tax, but some predicted some bigger cities with frothy housing markets might see pilot schemes come into force in the coming year.
Speculation has risen recently that China plans to expand property tax reforms beyond Shanghai and Chongqing in efforts to cool prices. State media have cited experts saying the southern tech hub of Shenzhen and the resort island of Hainan could be next to roll out pilot schemes.

Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale, with 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, analysts' median answer was 7, in line with the last poll.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2021 02:46AM ET</span>","UK house prices jump by 10.9%, could speed up further- Nationwide","LONDON (Reuters) -British house prices jumped by an annual 10.9%, the most in nearly seven years, and they look set to accelerate further as people seek new homes after the pandemic, mortgage lender Nationwide said.
Almost seven in 10 homeowners considering a move said they would be doing it even without the extension of a tax incentive by finance minister Rishi Sunak, Nationwide said, citing a survey it conducted in late April.
Shifting housing preferences were ""continuing to drive activity, with people reassessing their needs in the wake of the pandemic,"" Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said.
Tuesday's figures are the latest to show the scale of the surge in house prices which hit a new record high at an average of 242,832 pounds ($345,355.67), according to Nationwide.
Bank of England Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said in an interview published on Tuesday there was a ""risk that demand gets ahead of supply and that will lead to a more generalised pick-up in inflationary pressure.""
""We are looking carefully at the housing market and a raft of real-term indicators,"" he told the Guardian newspaper. 
Nationwide said house prices were 1.8% higher than in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to rise by 9.2% in annual terms and by 0.8% from April. 
Nationwide said there was scope for annual house price growth to accelerate further in the coming months, given how weak the housing market was in early stages of the pandemic.
But if unemployment rises sharply later in 2021 - when Sunak's jobs protection programme is due to expire - there was scope for activity to slow, perhaps sharply, it said.

Less timely but broader official data from the Office for National Statistics has shown that house prices in March jumped by just over 10%, the largest annual rise by that measure in nearly 14 years.

IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the sector rose to 51.9 in May from 50.4 the previous month, staying above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction for the fifth month in a row. 
""Russian manufacturers saw a modest improvement in operating conditions in May, and the sharpest since March 2019,"" said Sian Jones, an economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Contributing to the upturn was a renewed rise in new orders, as domestic and foreign client demand strengthened.""
The fastest output growth rate since February and an uptick in new business led to the sharpest rise in job creation since December 2018.
New export orders rose in May, although only fractionally, following four months of contraction, while supply shortages pushed up average cost burdens across the Russian goods-producing sector. 

Manufacturers were the least optimistic they have been about the outlook since January, although their overall view remained positive thanks to renewed order growth, new product development and hopes for an end to COVID-19-related restrictions.
""Our current forecast anticipates a near 3% year-on-year increase in industrial production during 2021,"" said Jones.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea exports logged their sharpest expansion in 32 years in May, marking another robust month of shipments fuelled by stronger consumer demand globally as many economies start to reopen.
Surging chip and car shipments helped power a 45.6% surge in South Korea's exports from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, posting the fastest growth since August 1988 and extending their expansion to a seventh month in a row. 
Exports growth, however, slightly missed a consensus of a 48.5% gain in a Reuters poll.
Asia's fourth-largest economy is the first major exporting economy to report monthly trade data that includes key IT products and the strength of its exports could further build confidence in a global economic recovery.
""Robust U.S. consumer spending means demand (for Korean products) will remain strong, and suggests May trade data for China and Japan will also be robust,"" said Park Sung-woo, an economist at DB Financial Investment said.
While the pace of shipments growth is set to slow as base effects from the coronavirus fade, the outlook for exports remains bullish.
""The base effect will keep exports growth strong through June and the pace will slow down in the third quarter. Annual exports growth will probably be double-digit,"" Park said.
In South Korea's largest port of Pusan, port congestion is so bad that the Pusan Newport International Terminal, one of the largest terminals in the country, has begun accepting container boxes only if they are due for shipment within five days, down from seven previously.
Separate data on the nation's factory activity showed activity extended growth into an eight straight month in May. The IHS Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) for May stood at 53.7, compared with 54.6 in April, with a reading above the 50-mark meaning an expansion in activity.
Reflecting the robust business activity, vice finance minister Lee Eog-weon on Tuesday said there are clearer signs of inflation, and that consumer inflation is likely to accelerate further in May. 
South Korea's Kospi inched up for a third straight session, up 0.52% by 0130 GMT at 3,219.98 as heavyweights across chips, cars and petrochemical sectors all gained. 
The export data showed shipments of chips gained 24.5% on-year, rising for an 11th month in a row, while shipments of cars soared 93.7%. Petrochemical products exports surged 94.9% from a year earlier.

Average exports per working day grew 49.0% in May, far outperforming a 29.5% increase of April when shipments gained 41.2%. 
Imports gained 37.9% on-year, missing forecasts for a 40.5% jump.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices surged in May while approvals to build new houses reached record highs, helped by super-low rates, adding yet another challenge for the country's central bank, which wants to keep rates low until inflation revives.
Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Tuesday showed national home prices climbed 2.2% in May, their second fastest increase since the late 1980s and the eighth straight monthly gain.
Separate figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed approvals to build private houses skyrocketed 67.4% in April from a year ago while total dwelling approvals soared nearly 40%. 
Record low borrowing rates together with a government ""HomeBuilder"" incentive has pushed up housing demand, which is likely to extend despite the conclusion of the fiscal scheme. The red-hot market has provided a much-needed windfall to consumer wealth and confidence.
Buyers have been further encouraged by the outlook for borrowing costs, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) repeatedly saying rates were likely to remain at a historic low of 0.1% until at least 2024.
The RBA announces its monthly monetary policy decision at 0430 GMT at which it is widely expected to hold rates and reiterate its dovish stance despite exuberance in recent data, as there are few signs of inflation and wage pressures. [AU/INT]
ECONOMIC SUCCESS
Other figures from the ABS out on Tuesday showed Australia's current account surplus hitting a record of A$18.3 billion, suggesting the A$2 trillion ($1.6 trillion) economy may have expanded at a faster pace than previously thought.
Yet, exports looked likely to detract 0.6 percentage points from March quarter GDP led by solid import volumes.
Importantly, business inventories climbed 2.1% confounding expectations for a 0.2% increase and implying a 0.7 percentage point contribution to GDP.
First-quarter GDP data is due on Wednesday where economists have forecast a brisk 1% quarterly rise, which would take annual output back to its pre-pandemic level.
The better-than-expected numbers were still unlikely to shake the RBA's dovish stance, in contrast to its New Zealand counterpart which has signalled interest rate hikes from as early as next year.

""The absence of any lived experience of price or wage inflation will likely see the RBA continue with the application of historically high levels of monetary accommodation, at least in the very near-term,"" said GSFM investment strategist Stephen Miller.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese companies cut spending on plant and equipment for the fourth straight quarter in January-March, as the economy struggles to shake off the drag from the coronavirus pandemic.
Weak business spending is likely to worry policymakers hoping strong domestic demand can help make the country's economic recovery more sustainable.
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Tuesday showed capital expenditure in the first quarter fell 7.8% from the same period last year, pulled down by weaker investments in transportation equipment, electrical machinery and real estate.
It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of annual decline in capital expenditure, after a 4.8% contraction the final quarter of last year.
""The figure gives a weak impression, but GDP was originally weak already,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
A separate, private-sector survey on Tuesday showed Japan's factory activity expanded in May, largely thanks to strong external demand, but at a slower pace.
The world's third-largest economy slumped back into decline in the first quarter as a slow vaccine rollout and repeated emergency curbs to halt a resurgence of infections hurt domestic demand.
The finance ministry's capex data, which will be used to update gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the first quarter due out June 8, was unlikely to impact the growth estimate in a major way, analysts said.
Some firms were seen putting off unnecessary investments in favour of holding onto cash, a finance ministry official said.
""Non-manufacturers have likely been building up cash positions rather than committing to spending for reinforcing safety, pushing back their capital expenditure plans beyond the fiscal year-end,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
RECOVERY SLOWING
After bouncing from last year's slump, driven by a strong export recovery, some analysts worry Japan's economy could slip back into recession in the current quarter due to extended coronavirus curbs.
A preliminary estimate found Japan's economy shrank an annualised 5.1% in the first quarter as households curtailed spending and export growth slowed sharply.
The latest MOF survey showed manufacturers' business spending fell 6.4% from a year earlier, posting a smaller contraction than the previous quarter's 8.5% drop.
That of service-sector firms dropped 8.5% year-on-year, up from a 2.6% decline in the previous quarter.
Weaker-than-expected factory output and retail sales figures on Monday showed that the economic recovery remained dependent on overseas demand.

Capital expenditure lost 0.4% in January-March from the previous quarter on a seasonally-adjusted basis, the MOF data showed.
Corporate recurring profits gained 26.0% in January-March from a year earlier, up for the first time in eight quarters, while sales were down for a seventh consecutive quarter, declining 3.0%.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52.0 last month, the highest level since December and inching up from April's 51.9.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the index to remain at 51.9. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
New orders rose at the strongest pace so far this year and a gauge for export orders was the highest since November, but the output reading, while still solid, was slightly lower than the previous month.
""Rapidly rising commodity prices began to disrupt the economy as some enterprises began to hoard goods, while some others suffered raw material shortages. Supply chains were also significantly affected,"" Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said in comments released alongside the survey's findings.
A sub-index for input costs expanded at the fastest pace since 2016.
Manufacturers passed on some of the pressure to their customers, with a gauge for output prices rising at the quickest pace in a decade. Charges for exported goods rose at the fastest rate in three years.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by the lifting of pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.
China's policymakers have repeatedly expressed concern about rising commodity prices in recent weeks and called for stricter management of supply and demand and to crack down on ""malicious speculation."" The warnings have prompted some pullback in metals prices but analysts are unsure how long such a correction may last given improving global demand.
Firms continued to hire but at a slower pace, with some enterprises saying they were trying to reduce costs.
Earnings at China's industrial firms grew at a slower pace in April, with high commodity prices and weaker performance in the consumer goods sector limiting overall profitability from manufacturing.

China's economy posted record growth in the first quarter as it recovered quickly from the pandemic although analysts expect the brisk expansion to moderate later this year.
Officials warn the foundations for economic recovery are not yet secure amid problems like higher raw material costs.

While export growth was in part inflated by last year’s 24% plunge, the outsized gains reinforce the view that global commerce is recovering from the pandemic and fueling Korea’s economic expansion. Increased vaccinations in major economies like the U.S. have allowed business regulations to be further relaxed and bolstered consumer confidence.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's annual economic growth rate picked up in January-March compared with the previous three months, but economists are increasingly pessimistic about this quarter after a huge second wave of COVID-19 infections hit the country last month.
A slow vaccination drive and local restrictions after a massive second wave of infections and deaths across the country have hit economic activities like retail, transport and construction while putting millions out of work.
India has recorded 28 million COVID-19 infections, second only to the United States, and 329,100 deaths as of Monday, although the rise has begun to slow.
Gross domestic product grew 1.6% in January-March compared with the same period a year earlier, mainly driven by state spending and manufacturing sector growth, data from the statistics ministry showed on Monday.
Economists said the country faces a slowdown in consumer demand as household incomes and jobs have declined, with limited scope for the government to offer growth stimulus due to its rising debt.
Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC bank, said while the year-on-year numbers for the April-June quarter might look upbeat due to a low base, the sequential growth is likely to contract.
""With the spread of the virus more acute in rural areas in this wave, rural demand and sectors dependent on the rural economy might come under stress.""
Economists have cut their growth forecast for the fiscal year that began in April to 8%-10% from an earlier 11%-12%.
Consumer spending - the main driver of the economy - rose 2.7% year-on-year in January-March following a revised 2.8% fall the previous quarter, data showed.
Annual growth of 6.9% in manufacturing and 14.5% in construction during the three months to March reflected signs of a recovery before the second wave hit the country. 
Investments rose 10.9% compared with growth of 2.6% the previous quarter, while state spending jumped 28.3% after almost no growth in the October-December period, data showed.
India also revised its annual GDP estimates for the fiscal year, predicting a 7.3% contraction, narrower than its earlier forecast for a downturn of 8.0%.
SLOW VACCINATION
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has faced criticism for the slow pace of his four-month-old vaccination campaign, which has inoculated fewer than 4% of India's 1.38 billion people.
The central bank, which has kept monetary policy loose while boosting liquidity to the economy, said last week the country's growth prospects will depend on how fast India can arrest infections.
Analysts warn that the slow rollout could pose medium-term risks to growth, especially if the country were to experience a third wave of COVID-19.
Unemployment soared to a near one-year high of 14.7% in the week ending May 23, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai-based private think tank.

Krishnamurthy Subramanian, chief economic adviser at the finance ministry, said that some growth momentum had been lost after a surge in virus cases.
""India continues to need monetary and fiscal policy support,"" he said after the release of data.

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 2.4% in May, up from 2.1% in April. A Reuters forecast had pointed to a May reading of 2.5%.
The ECB's chief economist, Philip Lane, said earlier this month the bank had a ""lot of work to do"" to raise inflation back to its 2% goal and market talk of rapidly rising prices is misplaced.
Euro zone inflation is approaching 2%, its fastest rate in years, on the back of fiscal support and the unwinding of last year's oil price crash, prompting some commentators to predict a new era of inflation.
But Lane pushed back on this narrative, arguing that the labour market will take years to get back to its pre-crisis level, corporate balance sheets are depleted and the economic rebound is still predicated on copious central bank and government support.

The ECB will next meet on June 10 and must decide whether to ease up on its stimulus given the prospect of rapid growth over the rest of the year as economic restrictions are lifted and the services sector rebounds.
""The ECB is unlikely to be disturbed by the short-term fluctuations in the inflation rate and will only slowly return its policy to normal,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said.

Investing.com –China’s factory activities growth slowed in May as Chinese firms struggled with higher raw material costs.
Data released earlier in the day said the Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) in May was 51.0, below the 51.1 reading in both forecasts prepared by Investing.com and April’s reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 55.2, above the previous month’s 54.9 reading. Both indexes remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion.
Although China continues its economic recovery from COVID-19, officials warn that the foundations of the recovery are not secure due to higher raw material prices and the outbreak of COVID-19 in parts of the world.
""External demand will likely remain flat"" as economic recoveries in the U.S. and parts of Europe will possibly be ""offset by increasing COVID-19 cases in ASEAN, which is the biggest trade partner of China,"" Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said in a note.
Meanwhile, China’s Guangdong province is facing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with producers in the city facing challenges including continued semiconductor chip shortages and high commodity prices.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have soared this year due to demand growth in post-lockdown cities.
The rising commodity prices have reportedly caused concerns among China’s policymakers who have called for tightened scrutiny of supply and demand and to crack down on ""malicious speculation.""
""We expect commodity prices to stabilize in the coming months,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, told Reuters. He added China’s firms will get released following the stricter scrutiny on spot and futures markets, as well as increased global commodity supply in the second half of 2021.
Meanwhile, the appreciation of Chinese currency and high shipping costs also added pressure on Chinese factories."

The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched lower to 51.0 in May, against analyst expectations that it would remain unchanged from April at 51.1, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, has stood above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for over a year.
While the Chinese economy has largely shaken off the gloom from the COVID-19 pandemic, officials warn the foundations for the recovery are not yet secure amid problems like higher raw material costs and the pandemic situation overseas.
Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, said in a note that ""external demand will likely remain flat"" as economic recoveries in the United States and parts of Europe are likely to be ""offset by increasing Covid cases in ASEAN, which is the biggest trade partner of China.""
Some emerging COVID-19 cases in China's Guangdong province, where most electronic factories are located, continued semiconductor chip shortages and high commodity prices are also among the challenges facing producers, she added.
A sub-index for new export orders stood at 48.3 in May, down from 50.4 in the previous month and slipping sharply into contraction.
A sub-index for raw material costs in the official PMI stood at 72.8 in May, up from April's 66.9 and hitting the highest level since 2010.
Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, fuelled by post-lockdown recoveries in demand and easing liquidity globally.
China's policymakers have repeatedly expressed concern about rising commodity prices in recent weeks and called for stricter management of supply and demand and to crack down on ""malicious speculation.""
""We expect commodity prices to stabilize in the coming months,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics.
Tougher oversight on spot and futures markets and increased global commodity supply in the second half of 2021 should help reduce cost pressures on China's firms, he said.
In addition to surging raw material prices, Chinese factories are struggling with high shipping costs and an appreciating Chinese currency. Some are able to pass on the higher costs to overseas customers, while some small firms are stopping taking orders to avoid losses. 
A sub-index for the activity of small firms stood at 48.8 in May, sharply down from April's 50.8. 
Firms continued to lay off workers and at faster pace, the official data also showed.
In the services sector, activity expanded for the 15th straight month, and at a faster pace, with the non-manufacturing PMI index rising to 55.2 from 54.9 the month before.
China posted a record 18.3% growth in the first quarter, but analysts expect the brisk expansion to moderate later this year.

Policymakers have pledged to support job-creating small firms that were hit harder by the coronavirus pandemic. The central bank is trying to cool credit growth to help contain debt risks, but is treading warily to avoid hurting the economic recovery.
""The mixed data strengthens our case for policy stability in the near term, especially before the CCP's centenary celebration in July,"" said analysts at Citi in a note, referring to the ruling Communist Party.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's industrial output extended gains in April as manufacturers benefited from a recovery in appetite for capital goods, especially in key overseas markets.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to grow in the current quarter at a much slower pace than previously thought after the government extended coronavirus emergency measures in Tokyo and other major areas.
Separate data on Monday showed retail sales, a key gauge of consumer spending, surged in April, thanks largely to favourable statistical base effects from a year earlier, when the country was under an even stricter coronavirus curbs.
Official data released on Monday showed factory output grew 2.5% from the previous month in April, as higher production of general-purpose and electrical machinery offset a contraction in cars and transportation equipment output.
The rise in output was better than the previous month's 1.7% gain, but much weaker than a 4.1% advance forecast in a Reuters poll of economists as car production fell largely due to supply issues with semiconductors.
""It confirmed Japan's output has been improving steadily due to export-driven gains,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""But it's hard to get excited by the overall picture as domestic conditions are very stagnant due to the coronavirus.""
Shipments of capital goods such as production machinery to the United States and China rose, a government official said, highlighting growing foreign demand for capital equipment as a global economic recovery picks up.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to lose 1.7% in May, followed by a sharp 5.0% rebound in June.
Factory output had posted a surprise increase in March, as a jump in car production helped keep the economic recovery on track. Hopes of a recovery in capital spending at home and in overseas markets and demand for tech-making equipment underpinned the outlook for output.
Some analysts worry that Japan's economy could fall into recession in the current quarter, after the government extended a COVID-19 emergency for Tokyo and other major areas until June 20, which is hurting consumer spending.
After emerging from last year's slump, the economy contracted in the first quarter as a slow vaccine rollout and repeated emergency measures put in place to halt a resurgence of infections dealt a blow to consumption.

In April, retail sales soared 12.0% year-on-year, the government said on Monday, mainly due to statistical base effects but also strong appetite for general merchandise and clothing.
Retail sales, however, shed 4.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to the previous month, as consumer sentiment struggled with the most recent measures to stem a halt in coronavirus infections.

321,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 30, 2021 09:36PM ET</span>",China’s Factory Outlook Steadies as Recovery Passes Its Peak,"(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of China’s manufacturing industry steadied in May, suggesting the economy’s recovery momentum might have peaked. The services and construction sectors strengthened.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index slowed slightly to 51 in May from 51.1 in the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday, lower than the median estimate of 51.1 in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The non-manufacturing gauge, which measures activity in the construction and services sectors, climbed to 55.2, above the 55.1 projected by economists. Readings above 50 indicate an expansion in output.
The official manufacturing reading pointed to a stabilization in output, with the fewer working days in the month compared to April possible affecting the results. External demand likely remained strong in May due to the reopening of some nations such as the U.S., but recent rapid increases in commodity prices are weighing on the profitability of companies, especially those that purchase raw materials like metal ores or coal.
The data confirms that “the pace of the economic recovery in China has been slowing,” Qu Hongbin, co-head of economics research at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “We are already past the peak of recovery momentum in China.”
Input prices for manufacturers jumped to 72.8 in the month, the highest since 2010.
A sub-index of new export orders for factories fell into contraction, down to 48.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month, while new orders were at 51.3.

The service sector recovery has been recovering this year with further reductions in domestic travel restrictions releasing some pent-up demand such as a surge in Chinese travel over the May Labor Day holidays, which exceeded pre-pandemic levels. However, that pickup in domestic consumption is still lagging behind the pickup in the industrial sector.
The construction sector strengthened, reversing its decline from a peak in March. A sub-index of manufacturing employment was at 48.9, the same as non-manufacturing employment.

From March, industrial production fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.6%, the biggest contraction since May last year and missing a gain of 1.5% forecast in a Reuters survey. 
However, on a yearly basis, factory output surged 12.4%, the fastest growth since October 2018 as production was sluggish in the second quarter of last year because of the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices surged in April, with a measure of underlying inflation blowing past the Federal Reserve's 2% target and posting its largest annual gain since 1992, because of pent-up demand and supply constraints as the economy reopens.
The strong inflation readings reported by the Commerce Department on Friday had been widely anticipated as the pandemic's grip eases, thanks to vaccinations, and will have no impact on monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly stated that higher inflation will be transitory. 
The U.S. central bank slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero last year and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. It has signaled it could tolerate higher inflation for some time to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its target, a flexible average.
The supply constraints largely reflect a shift in demand towards goods and away from services during the pandemic. A reversal is underway, with Americans flying to vacation destinations and staying at hotels among other activities. Year-on-year inflation is also accelerating as last spring's weak readings drop from the calculation. 
""Many goods are in short supply amid very strong demand and supply chain disruptions, and some services prices are up sharply as consumers start to go out again,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Shortages of labor in some industries are also contributing to higher prices. But many of these factors will prove transitory, and inflation will slow in the second half of 2021."" 
Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, increased 0.7% last month amid strong gains in both goods and services. That was the biggest rise in the so-called core PCE price index since October 2001 and followed a 0.4% gain in March.
In the 12 months through April, the core PCE price index vaulted 3.1%, the most since July 1992, after rising 1.9% in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core PCE price index rising 0.6% in April and surging 2.9% year-on-year.
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, though gains were capped by the rising price pressures. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
""Inflation is up, but real yields are still low,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Virginia. ""This is basically the transitory sweet spot.""

INCOME PLUNGES
Some economists are not convinced that higher inflation will be temporary.
A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumers' one-year inflation expectations shot up to 4.6% in May from 3.4% in April, hurting household sentiment. Their five-year inflation expectations rose to 3.0% from 2.7% last month.
""Concerns about the future can cause households to become more conservative in their spending,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The Fed is guessing that the rise in inflation will be temporary, and it better be correct.""  
Though consumer spending moderated last month as the boost to incomes from stimulus checks faded, households have accumulated at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, which should underpin demand. Wages are also rising as companies seek to attract labor to increase production.
Generous unemployment benefits funded by the government, problems with child care and fears of contracting the virus, even with vaccines widely accessible, as well as pandemic-related retirements have left companies scrambling for labor.
That is despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.5% last month. Data for March was revised higher to show spending surging 4.7% instead of 4.2% as previously reported. 
The rise in spending was in line with expectations. Spending was held back by a 0.6% drop in outlays on goods. Though purchases of long-lasting goods such as motor vehicles rose 0.5%, spending on nondurable goods tumbled 1.3%. Outlays on services increased 1.1%, led by spending on recreation, hotel accommodation and at restaurants. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending slipped 0.1% after jumping 4.1% in March. Despite last month's dip in the so-called real consumer spending, March's solid increase put consumption on a higher growth trajectory in the second quarter.
Personal income plunged 13.1% after surging 20.9% in March. With spending exceeding income, the saving rate dropped to a still-high 14.9% from 27.7% in March. Wages increased 1.0% for a second straight month.
Consumer spending powered ahead at a 11.3% annualized rate in the first quarter, contributing to the economy's 6.4% growth pace. Most economists expect double-digit growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.

Growth prospects for the second quarter were bolstered by another report from the Commerce Department showing the goods trade deficit narrowed 7.3% to $85.2 billion in April, with exports rising and imports declining. 
But inventory at retailers fell 1.6%, pulled down by a 7.0% plunge in automobile stocks as the sector struggles with a global semiconductor shortage.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated in May as consumers grew more concerned about a pickup in inflation, a survey released on Friday showed.
The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to a final reading of 82.9 from April's final level of 88.3, though it was little changed from May's preliminary reading of 82.8.
That was in line with the median forecast among economists polled by Reuters.
""Consumer confidence remained largely unchanged at the reduced level recorded at mid-month,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. ""It is hardly surprising that the resurgent strength of the economy produced more immediate gains in demand than supply, causing consumers to expect a surge in inflation.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions fell to 89.4 from April's 97.2, and also down from May's preliminary reading of 90.8.

The survey's gauge of consumer expectations slid to 78.8 in May from April's 82.7, but up modestly from the mid-month reading of 77.6.
The survey's one-year inflation expectation remained unchanged from May's preliminary reading of 4.6 percent, while the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook eased to 3.0 percent from 3.1 percent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output is expected to have risen for the second straight month in April on brisk exports and solid demand for electronic goods, a Reuters poll showed, a sign a rebound in overseas growth was cushioning the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Household spending is also set to show an increase in April from year-before levels, according to the poll, though the outlook is clouded by a likely extension of the current state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic.
Industrial production was forecast up 4.1% in April from the previous month, as manufacturers benefited from rising demand for machinery and electronic goods.
""A chip shortage may weigh on automobile production. But exports are strong thanks to a recovery in overseas growth, which likely drove up production of machinery,"" said analysts at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Household spending likely rose 9.3% in April from a year earlier, the poll also showed, though the gain is due largely to the base effect of last year's slump caused by the pandemic.
Compared with the previous month, household spending is expected to have fallen 2.2% in April.

Separate data showed core consumer prices in Tokyo fell in May, reinforcing expectations inflation will remain well below the central bank's 2% target for the time being.
The government is looking to extend state of emergency curbs to combat at the pandemic by about three weeks to June 20, a cabinet minister said on Friday, clouding the outlook for the fragile recovery.

""Job offers may have dipped again in May due to the third round of emergency declarations. That may further hold back the recovery in employment,"" said Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics.
""But further ahead we still expect both employment and the labour force to return to pre-virus levels in the second half of the year as vaccines allow the economy to return to full health.""
Core consumer prices in Tokyo, considered a leading indicator of nationwide figures, fell 0.2% in May from a year earlier, separate data showed on Friday, matching a median market estimate.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped more than expected last week as layoffs subsided, with companies desperate for workers to meet surging demand unleashed by a rapidly reopening economy.
The economy, which in the first quarter notched its second-fastest growth pace since the third quarter of 2003, is gaining speed, with other data on Thursday showing business spending on equipment accelerated in April. Activity is being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic's easing grip and nearly $6 trillion in relief provided by the government over the past year. 
""The economy is off and running,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Going forward growth will be supported by the pent-up savings that households have amassed during the pandemic."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 38,000 to a seasonally adjusted 406,000 for the week ended May 22, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020 and marked the fourth straight weekly decline in applications. 
The decrease was led by Washington state, Florida and New Jersey. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 425,000 applications for the latest week. Though claims remain well above the 200,000 to 250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions, they have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Pandemic-related restrictions on businesses have been rolled back, with more than half of adults in the United States fully vaccinated against COVID-19, leaving factories, construction sites, restaurants and bars, among many, clamoring for workers. 
The labor shortage, despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed, has been blamed on the safety net, strengthened during the pandemic by the government, to provide a temporary lifeline following the unprecedented economic and human carnage caused by the virus. (Graphic: Jobless claims, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznpnrygmpl/joblessclaims.png) 
Republican governors in at least 23 states, including Florida and Texas, have announced they are ending unemployment programs funded by the federal government next month, including a weekly $300 subsidy, which businesses say are discouraging the jobless from seeking work.
There is, however, no consensus that the generous unemployment benefits are keeping people home. According to JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Daniel Silver, an analysis of unemployment rates, wage growth and labor force participation rates in the 23 states suggested the early termination of the special benefits programs was motivated by politics rather than economics.
""While some of these states have tight labor markets and strong earnings growth, many of them do not,"" said Silver. ""It therefore looks like politics, rather than economics, is driving decisions regarding the early ends to these programs.""
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
BACK AT WORK
A survey by Poachedjobs.com, a national job board for the restaurant/hospitality industry, found most had returned to work, with a full schedule of 30-40 hours a week. 
For others, uncertainty about future restrictions on indoor dining and fears of contracting the virus, whether they are vaccinated or not, were keeping them away.
Fewer than 100,000 people filed claims last week under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs. The early termination of PUA and broadening economic re-engagement could push claims even lower and shrink the jobless rolls in the months ahead.
The claims report showed the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 96,000 to 3.642 million in the week ending May 15. The so-called continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, covered the period during which the government surveyed households for May's employment report. 
The decline strengthens expectations that hiring picked up this month, though raw material shortages across industries could be a constraint. The dearth of workers and scarcity of inputs were blamed for the modest 266,000 jobs created in April, a slowdown from the 770,000 added in March.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department confirmed that gross domestic product increased at a 6.4% annualized rate last quarter. The unrevised estimate followed a 4.3% growth rate in the fourth quarter.
Before tax corporate profits slipped $0.2 billion after decreasing $31.4 billion in the October-December period. A rise in domestic nonfinancial corporation profits was offset by lower domestic financial corporation and international profits.
""Over the year, profits should be boosted more directly by services industries as we expect consumer spending to transition back to the much-larger services category,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Graphic: GDP, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbpgaqdqpq/gdp.png) 
The strong growth momentum held early in the second quarter, with another report from the Commerce Department showing orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 2.3% in April.

With households sitting on at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings, demand booming, inventories low and profits rebounding, businesses are likely to continue investing in equipment to boost production, supporting manufacturing.

Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, jumped 2.3% last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. These so-called core capital goods orders increased 1.6% in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rising 1.0%. Orders shot up 14.7% year-on-year in April. 
Business investment on equipment has enjoyed double-digit growth over the last three quarters thanks to a shift in demand towards goods from services during the COVID-19 pandemic and massive fiscal stimulus to soften the blow to the economy from the public health crisis. 
Though demand is starting to revert back to services as vaccinations allow for broader economic re-engagement, appetite for goods remains healthy. But manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is experiencing shortages of labor and raw materials, impacting production at some industries.
Last month, core capital goods orders were lifted by machinery, primary and fabricated metal products, as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components fell 0.9%.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.9% after rising 1.5% in March. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
With households sitting on more than $2 trillion in excess savings, demand booming and inventories low, businesses are likely to continue investing in equipment to boost production.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dropped 1.3% in April after rising 1.3% in March. They were pulled down by a 6.7% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 3.1% decrease in March.

Orders for civilian aircraft increased 17.4%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received only 25 aircraft orders last month, mostly 737 MAX jets, compared to 196 in March.

Initial claims in regular state programs decreased by 38,000 to 406,000 in the week ended May 22, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 425,000 applications.
The decrease in claims underscores the labor market recovery is chugging along as vaccinations accelerate and remaining pandemic restrictions are eased. Hiring is expected to continue to pick up in the coming months as more Americans travel and socialize.
Claims data have been volatile during the pandemic due to backlogs, fraud and new programs. Also, multiple states have recently announced plans to pull out of federal unemployment benefit programs amid a debate about whether the aid is making it more difficult for employers to hire workers.

334,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2021 05:15AM ET</span>",China's industrial profits growth slows in April amid high commodity prices,"By Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) -Earnings at China's industrial firms grew at a slower pace in April, with high commodity prices and weaker performance in the consumer goods sector limiting overall profitability from manufacturing.
Profits at China's industrial firms rose 57% year-on-year in April to 768.63 billion yuan ($120.22 billion), down from 92.3% in March, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday.
For the January-April period, industrial firms' profits grew 106% from the same period a year earlier to 2.59 trillion yuan, bolstered by a virus-related plunge in activity early last year.
""The improvement of corporate performance is still uneven,"" said NBS official Zhu Hong in a statement accompanying the data.
""The profitability of some consumer goods industries has not yet recovered to pre-epidemic levels; coupled with the high prices of bulk commodities, this has increased the pressure on the production and operation of midstream and downstream industries.""
Chemical products and metals processing firms recorded some of the highest year-on-year profit increases over the first four months, according to NBS data, recovering from the COVID-19-induced slump in economic activity in the same period last year.
Profits surged 484% over January-April in the non-ferrous metals smelting and pressing industry. Synthetic fibre manufacturing posted a 650.2% profit increase.
Fast profit growth for metals processing has been spurred by higher metal prices, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING.
""But this good time may not last as the government is clamping down on high commodity prices,"" she said.
China's government watchdogs warned industrial metals companies to maintain ""normal market order"" during talks on significant gains in metals prices this year, China's top economic planner said on Monday.
Weaker garment and textile manufacturing profits reflect a still gradual global economic recovery amid uncertainties about COVID-19 cases in Asia, said Pang.
China's economy posted record growth in the first quarter as it emerged from the pandemic although analysts expect the brisk expansion to moderate later this year.
Officials warn the foundations for economic recovery are not yet secure amid emerging problems, including pressures on firms caused by higher raw material costs as international commodity prices rise. 
From the start of the year through mid-May, prices for China's steel rebar, hot-rolled steel coil and copper - vital for the construction of machinery, buildings, appliances and vehicles - surged more than 30%.
Exports accelerated in April, as a brisk U.S. recovery and stalled factory production in virus-hit countries including India boosted overseas orders from China.
However, growth in factory activity and output slowed in April, with companies facing challenges such as chip and container shortages, problems in international logistics and rising freight rates.
Liabilities at industrial firms increased 8.6% year-on-year at end-April, down from 9.0% growth as of end-March.

The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy added just under 121,000 formal jobs in April, official figures showed on Wednesday, lifting the total new positions created in the first four months of the year to almost 1 million.
The pace of job creation, however, appears to be slowing. The 120,935 net new positions in April was lower than the 172,500 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and aside from a shock slump in December it was the lowest in 10 months.
Economy Paulo Guedes put that down to the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic peaking. Compared to April last year when the first wave peaked and almost 1 million jobs were cut, Guedes said the outlook remains bright.
""The solution is to proceed with economic reforms and mass vaccinations, to ensure a safe return to work,"" Guedes said in an online address. ""It is hugely important that we maintain this rate of job growth to ensure we don't have economic scarring.""
Some 1.38 million positions were created in April and 1.26 million were cut. This means Brazil created a net 957,889 new formal jobs in the first four months of the year, the most for any Jan-April period in at least a decade.
These figures do not include the near-40 million undocumented workers in Brazil who do not have formal employment registration.
The figures for April were led by the services sector, which created a net 57,610 new positions, around half of the total. Construction accounted for 22,224 net new positions and industry 19,884, the ministry said.
The total number of formally registered workers in Brazil rose to 40.3 million in April, the highest April reading since 2015, according ministry figures.

Earnings rose too, with the average monthly salary of new jobs created up 2.5% in real terms from the prior month to an unadjusted 1,855.52 reais ($350).

(Reuters) - Mortgage applications decreased last week as fewer homeowners sought to refinance their loans, offsetting a modest rise in applications for loans to buy homes.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index decreased 4.2% in the week ended May 21 from a week earlier, reflecting a 7.2% decline in applications for refinancing. 
The purchase index increased 1.7% from a week earlier.
""Demand is robust throughout the country, but homebuyers continue to be held back by the lack of homes for sale and rapidly increasing home prices,"" Joel Kan, an economist at the MBA, said in a statement.
New home sales dropped 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 863,000 units in April as prices surged amid a tight supply of houses, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that home resales dropped for a third straight month in April.

""Housing is booming. The sector is so strong, there simply is not enough available supply,"" said Joseph Lavorgna, chief U.S. economist at Natixis CIB. ""This is weighing on home sales. In turn, home prices are accelerating. Eventually, more housing will be brought to market, but it will take time.""

Borrowing in April rose 5% from the previous month, as companies across several sectors lined up for loans, leases and lines of credit.
""An increasing number of businesses are opening up, as more Americans are receiving a vaccination, traveling and otherwise trying to return to some semblance of normalcy,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said on Tuesday.
""What we see so far in terms of capital equipment investment is indeed encouraging as we head into the summer months.""

Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.3% in April compared with 77% in March.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.

The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, reported a monthly confidence index of 72.1 in May, compared with April's reading of 76.1.

338,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 02:35PM ET</span>","U.S. consumer confidence holds steady, soaring prices slowing housing momentum","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence hovered at a 14-month high in May as optimism over jobs tempered concerns about rising inflation and diminishing government financial support.
Though the survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday suggested the pace of economic growth remained robust in the second quarter, the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic recession, which started in February 2020, is bumpy.
The housing market, one of the star performers, is showing signs of fatigue, with new single-family homes sales dropping in April amid a dearth of properties, which is boosting prices at the fastest pace in more than 15 years.
""Economic activity is getting back to where it was before the pandemic hit,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""So why aren't people more exuberant? We might want to start blaming inflation.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index slipped to a reading of 117.2 this month from 117.5 in April, the highest level since February 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 119.2.
Effective May, the Conference Board switched to an online from a mail survey. Data from January through April was revised to reflect the results of the online survey. The dip mirrored other sentiment surveys, which were pulled down by worries that rising inflation would erode consumers' purchasing power. 
Inflation is bubbling as the economy's reopening after coronavirus-related restrictions and massive fiscal stimulus unleash pent-up demand, which is pushing against supply constraints, leading to price hikes for most goods.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to a 14-month high of 144.3 from 131.9 last month. 
But the expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, fell to 99.1 from 107.9 in April. Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months jumped to 6.5% from 6.2% last month. 
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar was steady versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
(Graphic: Consumer confidence, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznvnrrgxvl/consconf.png) 
JOBS PLENTIFUL
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, raced to a reading of 34.6 in May from 21.6 in April. 
This measure, which closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report, is just below its 38.3 peak in August 2019. The jump in the so-called labor market differential this month likely reflected a record 8.1 million job openings.
It offers hope that job growth picked up this month. A labor shortage is hampering job growth, even as nearly 10 million Americans are officially unemployed. The worker shortage has been blamed on generous unemployment benefits, including a weekly $300 subsidy from the government.
Lack of child care facilities, with most schools offering partial in-person learning, as well as lingering fears of the virus and pandemic-related retirements are also believed to be contributing to the worker shortage, which curbed hiring in April. The government-funded benefits, part of the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, expire in early September and school districts are expected to resume in-person classes in the fall, which economists hope will boost the labor pool.
Fewer consumers planned to buy homes, cars and major household appliances over the next six months, relative to April. However, the link between these purchasing plans and consumer spending is weak.
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 863,000 units last month. March's sales pace was revised lower to 917,000 units from the previously reported 1.021 million units. Sales vaulted 48.3% on a year-on-year basis. 
(Graphic: New home sales, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qmypmeernpr/nhs.png) 
The market for new homes is being boosted by near record low inventory of previously owned houses, especially entry level homes. The pandemic has fueled demand for spacious and more expensive accommodations as millions of Americans work from home and take classes remotely. 
But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials, limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes to plug the inventory gap.
Demographics favor the housing market. People between the ages of 26 and 34 years account for about 12.5% of the U.S. population.
""A growing number of millennials are aging into their prime household formation years, which will remain a fundamental tailwind over the next few years,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
A third report showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index rose 13.2% in March from a year ago, the largest increase since December 2005, after rising 12.0% in February. 
(Graphic: Case Shiller, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yxmpjmmwgvr/caseshiller.png) 
Boiling house price inflation was underscored by a fourth report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency house price index jumped a record 13.9% on a year-on-year basis in March after advancing 12.4% in February. 
The White House said on Tuesday it was monitoring the soaring house prices, saying they raised concerns about ""affordability and access to the housing market.""

Economists and Federal Reserve officials do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.
Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Tuesday he didn't see the leverage in the housing market ""going to excess levels yet.""

(Reuters) - U.S. single-family home prices in 20 key urban markets rose in March from a year earlier by the most in more than seven years, a closely watched survey said on Tuesday.
The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas gained 13.3% through the 12 months ended in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, the largest annual price increase since December 2013. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a 12.3% increase.
On month-to-month basis, the 20-city composite index rose 1.6% from February. Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting a 1.2% increase.

U.S. existing home sales fell for a third straight month in April as an acute shortage of properties drove prices to a record high, data from the National Association of Realtors showed on Friday. 
Later on Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report new home sales for April, which are expected to moderate again.

New home sales dropped 5.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 863,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. March's sales pace was revised lower to 917,000 units from the previously reported 1.021 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for a small share of U.S. home sales, at a rate of 970,000 units in April.
New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. Sales surged 48.3% on a year-on-year basis in April. Monthly sales declined in the populous South, the Midwest and Northeast, but rose in the West.
The market for new homes is being boosted by near record low inventory of previously owned houses, especially entry level homes. The COVID-19 pandemic has fueled demand for spacious and more expensive accommodations as millions of Americans work from home and take classes remotely. 
But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials.
That is limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes to plug the inventory gap. The input shortages are raising new home prices as well. The National Association of Realtors reported last week that home resales dropped for a third straight month in April as prices surged to a record high because of the tight supply.
The median new house price soared 20.1% from a year earlier to $372,400 in April. Sales were concentrated in the $200,000-$399,000 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for a mere 2% of transactions last month.

There were 316,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 304,000 in March. At April's sales pace it would take 4.4 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.0 months in March. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
About 73% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale brightened to hit a two-year high in May as COVID-19 curbs were eased and infections fell, heralding a swift summer recovery after the economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter.
With many firms reporting a build-up of supply bottlenecks, Tuesday's Ifo business climate index readout showed a jump to 99.2, up from April's revised 96.6 and beating the 98.2 forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""The German economy is picking up speed,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
The survey among some 9,000 firms in manufacturing, the service sector, trade and construction showed that businesses were more satisfied with their current situation and optimistic regarding the coming six months.
It pointed to a quarterly growth rate of 2.6% from April to June and 2.8% from July to September, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
In the first quarter, GDP contracted by 1.8% quarter on quarter and by 3.1% on the year, significantly weaker readings than the euro zone average, Federal Statistics Office data showed earlier on Tuesday.
Coronavirus curbs in force during those months also spurred consumers to put more money than ever into savings, with the savings rate ballooning to an unprecedented 23.2%.
German households' disposable income increased slightly as the government ploughed billions of euros into job protection schemes and extra child benefits, but household spending fell by 5.4% on the quarter as curbs linked to containing the pandemic crimped consumption.
'SPLASHING OUT'
VP Bank Group economist Thomas Gitzel called that drop ""colossal"", but also said falling infection rates and progress in inoculations meant the economy would soon be back on a healthier footing as restrictions were eased and then lifted altogether.
""We're heading towards a relaxed summer in which retailers in German cities can expect consumers to splash out,"" he said.
Company investments in machinery and equipment fell slightly in the first quarter, though construction activity rose, the GDP data showed.
Wohlrabe said rising costs due to supply bottlenecks in manufacturing and construction were now increasingly being passed on.
In construction, two out of five firms reported difficulties procuring raw materials, and ""more and more companies indicate that they want to increase their sales prices,"" he said.
KfW bank economist Fritzi Koehler-Geib said her bank had raised its 2021 growth forecast to 3.5% from 3.3% ""despite the poor start to the year.""

Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer said his bank continued to expect German GDP to grow by 4.0% in 2021.
""A post-corona boom is emerging – even if the air is starting to get thin in the manufacturing sector, where business sentiment is already at a very high level,"" he added.

BERLIN (Reuters) -The German economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter as coronavirus-related restrictions spurred householders to put more money than ever into savings, data showed on Tuesday.
Europe's largest economy contracted by 1.8% quarter on quarter and by 3.1% on the year, the Federal Statistics Office said. The readings, for which a Reuters poll had forecast drops of 1.7% and 3.0% respectively, were significantly weaker than the euro zone average.
German households' disposable income increased slightly as the government ploughed billions of euros into job protection schemes and cash handouts such as extra child benefits. But curbs linked to containing the pandemic also made it harder for consumers to spend it.
""The drop in consumption is colossal,"" VP Bank Group economist Thomas Gitzel said.
Household spending fell by 5.4% on the quarter as the savings rate rose to a record high of 23.2%.
Company investments in machinery and equipment fell slightly, though construction activity rose.
Exports increased by 1.8% on the quarter helped by strong demand from the United States and China, while imports rose 3.8%, meaning net trade pushed down overall growth as well.
The quarter-on-quarter GDP data compared with a euro zone average of -0.6 percent, and growth of 0.4% in France, while the economy of the United States - whose vaccination programme has progressed more rapidly - grew 1.6%.
Year on year, the euro zone economy shrank 1.8%.

344,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2021 04:01AM ET</span>",UK borrowing shows first annual fall since start of pandemic,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's massive public borrowing began to head downwards last month for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bolstered by a brightening economic outlook that pointed to a potentially faster improvement in public finances. 
Public sector net borrowing in April totalled 31.7 billion pounds ($44.9 billion), official figures showed on Tuesday, down from a record 47.3 billion pounds a year earlier when the government finances felt the greatest impact of the pandemic.
Britain's government has spent heavily over the past year on health measures to limit the impact of COVID-19 as well as wage guarantees to stop unemployment rising significantly during the sharpest economic downturn in more than 300 years.
Borrowing in the 2020/21 financial year was 300.3 billion pounds or 14.3% of annual economic output, the highest share on this measure since the end of World War Two but slightly below an initial estimate a month ago.
British government forecasters predicted in early March that borrowing would fall to 10.3% of GDP this financial year.
However the growth outlook has improved since then thanks to a rapid roll-out of COVID vaccines, and monthly borrowing has come in below government predictions, prompting some economists to see a faster improvement in the public finances.
""The government's financial position isn't as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted only two months ago, reinforcing our view that the tax hikes and spending cuts that most fear may be avoided,"" Capital Economics's senior UK economist Ruth Gregory said.
Public sector net debt as a share of GDP is at its highest since 1962 at 98.5%, equivalent to 2.171 trillion pounds and up from around 1.8 trillion pounds before the pandemic.
But unlike earlier decades, interest rates are far lower, reducing both debt servicing costs and the urgency to lower debt levels that previous governments felt.
After the data, finance minister Rishi Sunak reiterated his plan ""to keep the public finances on a sustainable footing by bringing debt under control over the medium term"", while supporting short-term growth. 

Accountancy firm KPMG said revenue from corporation tax fell to the lowest in a year in April, which it linked to a temporary 'super-deduction' designed to boost growth by giving businesses tax credits worth 130% of new investment in plant and machinery.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) -Singapore's economy expanded more than first thought in the first quarter and the government maintained its growth forecast for the year, but struck a cautious note about recovery due to uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.3% year-on-year in the first quarter, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said on Tuesday, higher than the 0.2% growth seen in the government's advance estimate.
Manufacturing, finance and insurance and wholesale trade supported the expansion over the quarter. Analysts had expected a 0.9% increase, according to a Reuters poll.
MTI maintained its GDP growth forecast for 2021 at 4% to 6% for now but warned of a larger-than-usual degree of uncertainty caused by the pandemic as well as new domestic curbs against the virus. The outlook will be reviewed in August.
Authorities had last month said growth could exceed the upper end of the forecast range, recovering from the recession induced by the pandemic in 2020, its worst on record.
While it is possible that the Singapore economy will outperform the growth forecast for 2021 if external demand exceeds expectations, there are also significant downside risks, said Gabriel Lim, permanent secretary for trade and industry.
""The pace of recovery of the various sectors of the economy is likely to be more uneven than earlier expected,"" he said.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded 3.1% in the first quarter.
Separate data showed April factory output rose 2.1% year-on-year for the sixth straight month of growth, but it was the slowest gain since October and missed analysts' forecasts.
The city-state is often seen as a bellwether for global growth as international trade dwarfs its domestic economy.
The government has pumped more than S$100 billion ($75.34 billion) into the economy to cope with the fallout. The central bank maintained its accommodative monetary policy at its last meeting in April.
""The accommodative, supportive impulse from both fiscal and monetary policy continues to flow through the system,"" said Edward Robinson, deputy managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.
He said the policy stance remained appropriate and the MAS would review it in October, as scheduled. 
The central bank will consider factors that may affect ""inflation dynamics, as well as considerations of growth,"" he said.

Singapore this month re-imposed some restrictions on social gatherings, the toughest since exiting a lockdown last year, to combat a recent spike in local COVID-19 infections.
""A lot of the exuberance we had in the first quarter, that's kind of being rolled back a little bit,"" said Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's economy grew 0.5% in the first quarter, lifted by higher crude production and oil prices, the country's statistics office said on Sunday, as activities slowly gain momentum after the gradual easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
Africa's largest economy, exited its second recession since 2016 in the fourth quarter, despite a full-year contraction in 2020.
Nigeria had been grappling with low growth before the coronavirus pandemic triggered a recession and created large financing gaps, including dollar shortages and inflation.
""The Q1 2021 growth rate was slower than the 1.87% growth rate recorded in Q1 2020 but higher than 0.11% recorded in Q4 2020, indicative of a slow but continuous recovery,"" The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
Nigeria is inoculating its 200 million citizens, but last month directed its regions to stop giving first doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines once they use half their current stock, to safeguard supply for a second dose.
The NBS said the non-oil sector, which the government is trying to make the main growth sector, rose 0.79% in the first quarter. Telecoms, crop production, real estate, food manufacturing and construction lifted growth in the quarter.
Crude prices rose above $70/barrel on Tuesday but fell on Wednesday on renewed demand concerns as COVID-19 cases in Asia rose and fears that rising inflation might lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise rates, which could limit growth.
Oil, which accounts for around two-thirds of Nigerian government revenue and 90% of foreign exchange, contracted 2.21% in the first quarter as crude production rose to 1.72 million barrels per day from the fourth quarter.
With weak growth, few expect Nigeria's central bank to alter interest rates next week. 

The bank has pursued an accommodative stance by leaving interest rates on hold. However, dollar shortages have stoked inflation to a more than 4-year high, while a shrinking labour market and mounting insecurity have pressured households. 
""While this points to the likelihood of firmer growth from the second quarter, it still does not allow for a more robust policy response to inflationary pressures,"" Razia Khan, chief economist for Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), said.

The online survey conducted the week of May 9 through 15 showed the estimated employment rate among adults dipped to 71.1% from 71.8% in the April survey, with unemployment rising and a drop in the share of adults either working or looking for work.
The statistics in the ""Real Time Population Survey"" are not meant to duplicate exactly the monthly survey of households conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate the U.S. unemployment rate.
But it uses questions that closely track that survey, and is timed to provide a mid-month estimate of national employment trends. It was developed because of the pandemic in an effort to give officials more frequent updates on the state of the labor market.
It registered a big jump in March, when the economy ended up adding nearly a million new jobs, and dipped in April when job growth disappointed at just 266,000. 

The May outcome will be watched closely for signs that workers are ready to move off the sidelines into the record number of new jobs posted by companies.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economists have estimated the U.S. will add about 488,000 new positions next month, still below the million or more per month that Fed officials and others were expecting as the economy ramps up.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity gathered speed in early May amid strong domestic demand, but backlogs of uncompleted work are piling up as manufacturers struggle to find raw materials and labor, boosting costs for both businesses and consumers.
Though other data on Friday showed sales of previously owned homes dropping to a 10-month low in April as an acute shortage of houses drove prices to a record high, they remained well above their pre-pandemic level. The housing market and manufacturing have led the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession, which started in February 2020.
""The economic recovery continues,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 61.5 in the first half of this month. That was the highest reading since October 2009, and followed a final reading of 60.5 in April. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to 60.2 in early May. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
Demand shifted to goods from services as the pandemic kept Americans at home, causing supply constraints. The virus also disrupted labor at manufacturers and their suppliers, leading to raw material shortages across industries.
More than a third of the population has been vaccinated, allowing the broader economy to reopen. While that, together with nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief provided by the government over the past year, is unleashing pent-up demand for services, appetite for goods remains healthy. 
According to IHS Markit ""manufacturers highlighted that strain on capacity and raw material shortages are expected to last through 2021."" It noted that the supply crunch was raising production costs for manufacturers, who ""made efforts to pass higher cost burdens on to clients.""
The IHS Markit survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers rose to the highest level since July 2008. 
Federal Reserve officials generally view the supply chain bottlenecks as transitory and expect them to temporarily drive inflation above the U.S. central bank's 2% target. There is also acknowledgment that the bottlenecks could take longer to ease. 
Minutes of the Fed's April 27-28 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed ""a number of participants remarked that supply chain bottlenecks and input shortages may not be resolved quickly,"" and that this ""could put upward pressure on prices beyond this year. These officials also ""noted that in some industries, supply chain disruptions appeared to be more persistent than originally anticipated.""
According to IHS Market, backlogs of work accumulated early this month at the fastest pace in 14 years. Its measure of new orders increased. Though factories tried to recruit more workers, the pace of hiring was the slowest in five months.
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.
RECORD HOUSE PRICES
In a separate report on Friday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales dropped 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.85 million units last month, the lowest level since June. The third straight monthly decline in sales came as transactions fell in the Northeast, West and the densely populated South. Sales rose in the Midwest.
Economists had forecast sales rebounding 2.0%. Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. housing sales, were up 20% in the first four months of this year, compared to the same period in 2020. The housing market is being driven by demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations after the pandemic forced millions of Americans to work from home and take classes remotely. But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials.
That is limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes, keeping in place an inventory shortage that is boosting prices and threatening to sideline first-time homebuyers from the market. The government reported this week that homebuilding tumbled in April. 
There is hope that the reopening economy could encourage more homeowners to put houses on the market. Some elderly Americans likely delayed downsizing because of the pandemic. 
The median existing house price shot up 19.1% from a year ago to an all-time high of $341,600 in April. 
Economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than poor lending practices, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.
""The people buying homes have the income and down payments as they are often trading one home for another,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""And economic growth should remain strong through this year, and while next year it may moderate, it is not expected to falter significantly.""  

There were 1.16 million previously owned homes on the market in April, down 20.5% from a year ago. At April's sales pace, it would take 2.4 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 4.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
Houses typically remained on the market for 17 days in April, down from 27 days a year ago. Eighty-eight percent of the homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month. First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in April, down from 36% a year go.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth accelerated at its fastest pace in over three years in May, a survey showed on Friday, but European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said an uncertain recovery still needed emergency support from the ECB. 
After a slow start to vaccinations the pace is picking up, allowing some restrictions imposed to quell the spread of the coronavirus to be lifted, and a strong resurgence in the bloc's now-reopening service industry added to the impetus from a booming manufacturing sector.
As the economy rebounds and confidence improves, some policymakers are making the case for the ECB to start giving up its emergency measures and revert to more traditional forms of stimulus.
But others are more cautious, warning the fledgling recovery is predicated on copious ECB support and that a recent rise in borrowing costs to two-year highs is already a major drag. 
""We are committed to preserving favourable financing conditions. It's far too early and it's actually unnecessary to debate longer-term issues,"" Lagarde said on Friday.
""I have repeatedly said that policymakers needed to provide the right bridge across the pandemic, well into the recovery, so we can actually deliver on our mandate.""
Alongside that, euro zone finance ministers will continue to support their economies but were upbeat on Friday about prospects for the post-pandemic recovery.
With more businesses reopening - or at least adapting to lockdowns - IHS Markit's flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to economic health, climbed to 56.9 in May from April's final reading of 53.8. 
That was its highest level since February 2018 and comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, as well as the more modest increase to 55.1 predicted in a Reuters poll.
""We don't think today's euro area PMI data will cause the ECB to taper the PEPP next month,"" said George Buckley at Nomura.
The bloc's economy will expand 1.4% this quarter, according to a Reuters poll last week that also found forecasts for the rest of the year had been downgraded from last month. [ECILT/EU]
""May's increase in the euro zone Composite PMI reflects the further lifting of virus restrictions in many parts of the region and suggests that the economic recovery is now underway,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
In Germany, Europe's largest economy, services activity rose by the most in nearly a year, helped by a loosening of restrictions. But supply bottlenecks in manufacturing led to production problems at a growing number of factories.
The lifting of a lockdown in France unleashed a business boom there, with activity surging past expectations to set the stage for an economic rebound.
A deal agreed by the European Union on Thursday to open up tourism across the 27-nation bloc this summer should provide a boost to tourism-dependent economies that were hammered by restrictions last year.
INFLATIONARY PRESSURES
A preliminary PMI covering the 19-country euro zone's dominant service industry bounced to 55.1 from April's 50.5, well above the 52.3 median forecast in the Reuters poll and its highest since June 2018.
Services firms benefited from the release of pent-up demand. The new business index - which has been below 50 almost throughout the pandemic - soared to 56.7 from 49.7, its highest since January 2018.
The manufacturing industry has weathered the coronavirus crisis much better than services as factories largely remained open. Its flash PMI dipped from April's record high of 62.9 to 62.8 but was ahead of the 62.5 Reuters poll estimate.
An index measuring output that feeds into the composite PMI dropped to 61.9 from 63.2.
But supply-side issues have made it a seller's market for purveyors of raw materials and factories faced a record increase in input costs. The sub-index soared to 86.5 from 82.2, its highest since the survey began in June 1997.
""The combination of demand returning quickly for services and input shortages emerging are creating a perfect environment for surging pipeline inflation,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.

Hopes the vaccine rollout is successful and that the worst of the pandemic is behind the bloc pushed overall optimism to its highest since IHS Markit began collecting the data in July 2012. The composite future output index rose to 69.7 from 68.9.
Consumer confidence in the bloc improved more than expected this month, official data on Friday showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell for a third straight month in April as an acute shortage of properties drove prices to a record high. 
Existing home sales dropped 2.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.85 million units last month, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. 
Sales fell in the Northeast, West and the densely populated South, but rose in the Midwest. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rebounding 2.0% to a rate of 6.09 million units in April. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 33.9% on a year-on-year basis. The annual increase was, however, distorted by the plunge in sales in April 2020, when the economy was reeling from mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases. 
The housing market is being driven by demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations after the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of Americans to work from home and take classes remotely. But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, causing shortages of lumber and other raw materials.
That is limiting builders' ability to ramp up construction of new homes, keeping in place an inventory shortage that is boosting prices and threatening to sideline first-time homebuyers from the market. The government reported this week that homebuilding tumbled in April. 
There is cautious optimism that the reopening of the economy, facilitated by the vaccination of more than a third of the population and massive fiscal stimulus, could encourage more homeowners to put houses on the market. Some elderly Americans likely delayed downsizing because of the pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) -British shoppers splashed out on new clothes in April after shops reopened following months of lockdown closures, adding to signs of a robust economic recovery, official data showed on Friday.
Sales volumes in April jumped 9.2% month on month - twice the average forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the biggest rise since June - after rising 5.1% in March. Clothing sales soared by almost 70%.
""Fashion retailers (were) the ultimate beneficiaries of beer gardens reopening and the 'rule of six' night out returning,"" said Aled Jones, head of retail at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank.
Bank of England policymakers are keeping a close watch on retail sales, expecting a surge in spending as wealthier households spend savings built up during lockdowns. 
The central bank forecast this month that the economy would grow by 7.25% this year after slumping by nearly 10% in 2020, its biggest decline in more than 300 years.
But unlike after previous recessions, unemployment has stayed low so far, thanks to a costly government furlough programme that has benefited millions of employees.
Separate data on Friday, from Britain's longest-running survey of consumer sentiment, showed that morale in May was back at where it was just before the country first went into lockdown in March 2020.
The Office for National Statistics said retail sales in April were 10.6% above their pre-pandemic level. However, many high-street shops have suffered badly from repeated lockdowns that accelerated the shift to online commerce.
Department store Debenhams closed its last store this month after more than 240 years of trading and its brand name was bought by online retailer Boohoo.
Retailers such as clothing and furniture stores that the government classed as non-essential were unable to reopen to shoppers in England until April 12, after being forced to close in early January.
Online retail's share of spending dropped to 30.0% in April from 34.7% in March, its lowest since December. Spending at supermarkets also fell slightly on the month as restaurants reopened for outside dining. 
Sales volumes last month were 42.4% higher than in April 2020, when they collapsed during Britain's first coronavirus lockdown, the ONS said.

Consultants Capital Economics said sales growth was likely to level off now that spending was above pre-crisis levels.
""Economic recovery will continue. It's just it will be driven by a surge in spending in the pubs, restaurants and cinemas rather than the shops,"" Capital Economics' chief UK economist Paul Dales said.

352,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2021 03:35AM ET</span>","German services recover, factories struggle -PMI","BERLIN (Reuters) - German services activity rose by the most in nearly a year in May, helped by a loosening of COVID-19 restrictions, while supply bottlenecks in manufacturing led to production problems at a growing number of factories, a survey showed on Friday.
IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the services sector jumped to 52.8 from 49.9 in April. That beat a Reuters poll forecast of 52.0 and was the highest reading since last July.
""The improved performance in services comes at a crucial time, making up for a further loss of momentum in manufacturing due to worsening supply issues,"" said Phil Smith at IHS Markit.
The flash PMI for manufacturing eased to 64.0 from 66.2 in the previous month. The figure came in weaker than expected, but was still well above the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction.
As a result, the preliminary composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to 56.2 in May from 55.8 in the previous month.
While factories still enjoyed strong demand, more companies reported supply shortages curbing production and weighing on new orders due to forced downtime at customers, the survey showed.

The supply bottlenecks also pushed up factory input prices at a rate never seen before in the survey's history, Smith said.
""Inflationary pressures are increasingly spreading to services as well, pushing the overall measures of input costs and output prices both to record highs,"" he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell for the ninth straight month in April as a record slump in cellphone fees offset rising energy prices, suggesting that weak demand and higher costs will weigh on a fragile economic recovery.
Separate data showed firms facing rising input costs and a slower expansion in factory activity in May, highlighting risks to an economy heavily reliant on the manufacturing sector.
The data underscores the challenge policymakers face in combating a resurgence in COVID-19 infections without hobbling an economy already lagging other major trading partners emerging from the pandemic-induced slump.
""Inflation fell in April but that was almost entirely due to a plunge in mobile phone tariffs,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""Looking past temporary distortions, we think underlying inflation will continue to rise a bit further, though unlike in some other advanced economies.""
The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes the effect of volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.1% in April from a year earlier, smaller than a median market forecast for a 0.2% drop, government data showed on Friday and in line with March's decline.
A record 26.5% in cellphone charges knocked 0.5% off core CPI, the data showed, as carriers heeded Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's calls to ease the burden on households.
By contrast, energy prices rose 0.7% in April, marking the first gain since January 2020 due to recent rises in crude oil costs and the base effect of last year's slump.
Any decline in manufacturers' profits would be a huge risk to firms' capital expenditure plans and leave the economy without a driver as the country wrestles with the hit to consumption, analysts say.
Manufacturers saw the pace of input prices increases accelerate, while output price growth eased slightly, causing the widest gap between the two measures in nearly a decade, a private sector survey showed on Friday.

Japan's economy shrank in the first quarter and analysts expect any rebound in April-June to be modest as new COVID-19 infections forced the government to re-introduce state of emergency curbs, hurting already weak consumption.
Inflation has barely picked up in Japan as companies remain wary of passing on higher costs to households, even as supply bottlenecks and labour shortages stoke inflation fears in the United States and some other advanced economies.

The GfK Consumer Confidence Index improved to -9 in May from -15 in April, matching its level in March 2020 before the full force of the coronavirus pandemic hit the country.
The index has been rising since January as Britain rolled out Europe's fastest COVID vaccines programme.
""The financial mood of the nation has bounced back to its pre-lockdown figure of minus 9 this month, meaning confidence has made up all the ground lost to COVID-19,"" Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, said.
A measure of optimism about the outlook for the economy over the next 12 months jumped by 15 percentage points and there was a five-point improvement in a gauge of how willing consumers are to make a major purchase.
The Bank of England is watching closely for how much is spent from savings that many richer households built up over three lockdowns in the past year, as it assesses the need for keeping its huge economic stimulus programme in place.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped further below 500,000 last week, but jobless rolls swelled in early May, which could temper expectations for an acceleration in employment growth this month.
Indeed, other data on Thursday showed a measure of factory employment in the mid-Atlantic region fell in May. But businesses in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware increased employees' work hours, suggesting problems finding workers. Labor and raw material shortages were likely behind the significant slowdown in the pace of growth in output at the region's factories this month.
The supply constraints follow pent-up demand unleashed by the economy's reopening after being severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic for more than a year. 
""If the data are taken at face value, it would suggest both a reduction in layoffs and a slowing in hiring, which given the rising level of labor demand could only be explained by a reduction in labor supply,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor a Brean Capital in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 444,000 for the week ended May 15, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020 and held claims below 500,000 for two straight weeks. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 450,000 applications for the latest week. Claims remain well above the 200,000 to 250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with healthy labor market conditions. They have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020.
Applications are likely to decrease further in the weeks ahead after Republican governors in at least 21 states announced they would withdraw next month from unemployment programs funded by the federal government. These included a weekly $300 subsidy, which businesses say are encouraging the jobless to stay at home instead of seeking work.
From manufacturing to restaurants and bars, employers are scrambling to find workers, even as nearly 10 million Americans are officially unemployed. The enhanced unemployment benefits give more than most jobs paying minimum wages, which range from as low as $7.25 per hour to as high as $15.
Stocks on Wall Street rebounded after a three-day slide. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS 
Lack of child care facilities, with most schools offering partial in-person learning, as well as lingering fears of COVID-19 and pandemic-related retirements are also believed to be contributing to the worker shortage, which curbed hiring in April. The government-funded benefits expire in early September and school districts are expected to resume in-person classes in the fall, which economists hope will boost the labor pool.
Minutes of the Federal Reserve's April 27-28 policy meeting published on Wednesday acknowledged reports of businesses
""having trouble hiring workers."" They noted some of the factors behind the worker scarcity ""were seen as likely to remain significant while pandemic-related risks persisted.""
But some economists, including at the White House, disagree that the generous benefits are a deterrent to work.
""Unemployment aid is not keeping workers on the sidelines,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation. ""Emergency unemployment aid is doing what it is meant to do, serving as a temporary lifeline while workers search for and return to work.""
The claims data included the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of May's employment report. The economy created 266,000 jobs in April after adding 770,000 in March.
To get a better picture of how hiring fared in May, economists will await data next week on the number of people continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid. The so-called continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.
Continuing claims increased 111,000 to 3.751 million during the week ended May 8. There were about 16 million people on unemployment benefits under all programs on May 1.
""The overall trend in labor market conditions remains positive, even though it is unclear how that will translate quantitatively into next month's employment data,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) in Jersey City.
With more than a third of the population vaccinated, restrictions on services industry businesses are being lifted. The economy is also being underpinned by nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief provided by the government over the past year.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business activity index fell to 31.5 this month from 50.2 in April. A reading above zero indicates growth in the mid-Atlantic region's manufacturing sector. 
Its measure of new orders received by factories grew at a slower pace in May relative to April as did shipments. But backlogs of uncompleted work continued to pile up, testament to the inputs shortage. The survey's gauge of factory employment dropped to a reading of 19.3 from 30.8 in April. The average workweek index jumped six points to 35.5.

Despite the bottlenecks in the supply chain, the economy is powering ahead. A third report from the Conference Board showed its gauge of future economic activity surging above its pre-pandemic level in April.
""The economy is solidifying at a high level of growth,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers reported the fastest growth in orders since December 2017 in May but fear supply-chain bottlenecks will cause their costs to rise sharply, according to a survey which adds to signs of a rebound for factories. 
The Confederation of British Industry's industrial orders balance - measuring the proportion of firms reporting order volumes above or below normal - rose to +17 from -8 in April.
Overall output growth over the past three months was the highest since December 2018 and represented the first material growth in almost two years, the CBI said.
""The industrial sector is booming ... for now,"" Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Export orders lagged behind domestic demand, which Tombs said reflected new post-Brexit trade barriers. Demand for goods was also likely to soften later in 2021 as spending shifted more towards services as the economy reopened.
Official data for March released last week showed factory output was 2% below its level in February 2020, before Britain went into its first COVID lockdown which caused output to slump briefly by 30%.
Other surveys of manufacturers, such as the monthly Purchasing Managers' Index, have also pointed to strong growth. April's PMI showed the biggest rise in new orders since November 2013.
However, the pandemic is still having a knock-on impact on global supply chains, with shortages of everything from micro-chips to building supplies. Last month carmaker Jaguar Land Rover temporarily stopped production at two factories in Britain due to a lack of semi-conductors.

""Firms are still feeling the chill as supply shortages fuel cost pressures, reflected in expectations for strong output price inflation in the coming quarter,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
The survey's price balance rose to its highest since January 2018 at +38 in May, up from April's +27 and well above its average of +3.

(Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region slowed down in May after hitting its highest pace in nearly half a century earlier this spring, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to 31.5 from 50.2 in April. That was shy of economists' expectations for a reading of 43.0, according to a Reuters poll.
Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.
It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, next due out June 1.
Factories have struggled to keep up with demand in recent months as the economy shows signs of emerging from the COVID-19 recession and consumers flush with cash from recent stimulus programs ramp up spending. In March, the Philly Fed's factory activity gauge hit its highest level since April 1973.
The bank's employment index decreased to 19.3 from 30.8 the previous month.
Additionally, the price paid index rose to 76.8 from 69.1 in the month prior.

358,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2021 08:38AM ET</span>","Initial Jobless Claims Fall to 444k, New Post-Pandemic Low","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell to a new post-pandemic low last week, adding to evidence of a steady recovery in the labor market as the economy reopens.
Initial jobless claims fell to 444,000, from a total of 478,000 the previous week, which was revised upward by 5,000. 
The number of continuing claims, which are measured with a one-week time lag to initial ones, rose however by over 100,000 to 3.751 million. 
The broadest measure of all those claiming unemployment-related benefits, however, corroborated the general downward trend. It fell by some 900,000 to 15.975 million as of the week ending May 1, the Labor Department said.
The numbers will do little to change perceptions of a job market recovery that is still closer to its start than its end. The presence of 16 million Americans still claiming some sort of dole is likely to carry huge weight with  Federal Reserve officials who have consistently argued that they should not withdraw monetary stimulus until the labor market has made ""substantial progress"".
At the margins, the rise in continuing claims may reinforce concerns about mismatches between the supply of labor and the demand for it, as the jobs destroyed by the pandemic are replaced by new ones requiring different skills. That issue was seen as largely responsible for the disappointing labor market report for April, which saw hiring rebound much more weakly than expected.
""While the ongoing improvement in initial claims is encouraging, the progress in continuing claims has slowed significantly in the last few weeks,"" said Daniel Zhao,. senior economist with Glassdoor, via Twitter. He warned to be on the lookout for any other signs of a slowing market recovery ahead of the May jobs report in just over two weeks' time. "

The rise in producer prices followed a 3.7% year-on-year increase in March and compared with a Reuters poll forecast of 5.1%.
Compared to the previous month, producer prices were up 0.8% in April, the federal statistics office said.
The index looks at factory gate prices, meaning before products or components are further processed or go on sale. It can therefore give an early indication of the development of overall consumer price inflation.
""Price pressures continue to point upwards also at the producer level,"" LBBW economist Jens-Oliver Niklasch said.
""At the moment, it's difficult to say how much of the costs companies will actually be able to pass on to consumers,"" he added.

The supply bottlenecks and overall economic recovery are expected to push up price pressures in Germany, with the government forecasting consumer price inflation to jump to 2.2% this year and to ease to 1.5% next year.
Still, European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel told German broadcaster ARD on Wednesday that the surge in euro zone inflation is temporary and consumer prices should fall sharply next year.

Exports to the United States, Germany's biggest sales market outside the European Union, soared by 60.4% year-on-year in April to 10.1 billion euros ($12.31 billion), preliminary trade figures from the statistics office showed.
Exports to China, Germany's second largest exports destination outside the EU's single market, rose by 16.3% to 8.4 billion euros, the office said.
Exports to Britain jumped by 58.6% on the year to 5.1 billion euros.
Overall, exports to non-EU countries rose by 35.6% on the year to 50.8 billion euros.
The statistics office said that the year-on-year figures for April were strongly impacted by the first coronavirus wave in 2020 which had pushed down exports compared to April 2019.
It added that exports to non-EU member states, also called third countries, accounted for roughly 47% of overall exports. This means that more than half of Germany's exports still go to clients within the EU's single market despite Britain's exit.
""When comparing with the same month of the previous year, it should be noted that German exports to third countries in April 2020 fell by 27.1% compared to April 2019 in the wake of the coronavirus crisis,"" the statistics office said.

Online property portal Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said flats are now the most in-demand property type for the first time in at least 10 years, with buyer interest up 39% since January - based on the number of times people contacted estate agents about properties. 
Demand for city-centre housing in general has risen by 35%, compared with a 32% rise in demand for housing in villages.
The survey adds to signs that the British property market's pandemic boom has persisted with help from finance minister Rishi Sunak. In March's budget he extended a cut to property purchase taxes and announced a new mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers who cannot afford large deposits.
""These are early signs but they certainly point to some good news for city centres across Great Britain, with a number of agents now telling me they've seen a marked uptick in demand from first-time buyers,"" Rightmove's director of property data, Tim Bannister, said.
Rightmove said buyer demand for flats in April stood 51% above pre-pandemic levels in February 2020.
Official data published on Tuesday showed house prices rose in March by more than 10% in annual terms - the biggest increase since August 2007. The Office for National Statistics also said prices of detached houses rose by 11.7% in the year to March, compared with an increase of 5.0% for flats and maisonettes.

Since then, Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants to reopen. Almost all restrictions are due to end in late June.
""People starting to venture into their local high streets and once again experiencing the buzz of their city centres, along with greater mortgage availability for first-time buyers, means city centres are staging a much-needed comeback,"" Bannister said.

Japanese exports jumped again, climbing in April by more than a third from last year’s dismal level, as recovering global trade gave a needed boost to an economy that’s stalling at home amid new waves of the coronavirus.
Surging car and auto parts shipments helped power a 38% rise in Japan’s exports from a year earlier, according to figures Thursday from the finance ministry that beat all but one forecast from 26 surveyed analysts. The consensus was for a 30.8% gain.
Although the data give an inflated view of the strength of exports because they’re based on a comparison with 2020’s terrible figures, the report still shows trade bouncing back -- a major positive for the global economy and Japan. Shipments climbed almost 8% compared with 2019.
A separate report showed Japanese machinery orders, a leading indicator of capital spending, gained in March from the prior month.

363,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 11:47PM ET</span>",Japan's exports jump most in decade as trade recovery perks up,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports grew the most since 2010 in April while capital spending perked up on surging global demand for cars and electronics, lifting hopes that an improvement in trade could help lead the world's third-largest economy back to growth.
Also brightening the outlook, confidence among the nation's manufacturers hit a more than two-year high in May on the back of solid overseas orders, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.
While the stronger exports and imports are partly helped by the favourable statistical base effects from the major plunge in trade seen a year earlier, real demand is also on the mend.
Global appetite for cars and electronics has picked up since last year, driven by a recovery in the U.S. and Chinese economies -- Japan's key markets -- although global chip shortages put a drag on overseas shipments in recent months.
Exports rose 38.0% in April from a year earlier, official data showed on Thursday, compared with a 30.9% increase expected by economists and following a 16.1% rise in March. That was the fastest gain since April 2010, led by U.S.-bound shipments of cars and car parts and Chinese demand for chip-making equipment.
""The trade data confirmed that exports were recovering steadily. Particularly car exports, which fell a lot last year, are picking up,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
""In Japan, capital spending tends to move in sync with external demand, so an export recovery is encouraging for machinery orders and capital expenditure.""
By destination, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 33.9% year-on-year in April, led by shipments of chip-making equipment, hybrid cars and scrap copper.
U.S.-bound exports grew 45.1% in the year to April, the fastest gain since 2010, on the back of demand for automobiles, car parts and ship engines.
Separate data from the Cabinet Office showed Japan's core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, rose 3.7% in March from the previous month.
The rise in core orders, which exclude those of ships and electric utilities, compared with a 6.4% increase seen in a Reuters poll of economists, the data showed.
The Cabinet Office maintained its assessment on machinery orders, saying that a pick-up is stalling.
Japan's economy fell back into decline in the first quarter and economists have sharply revised down estimates for growth this quarter as emergency curbs hobble consumer spending that makes up more than half the economy.

""Export growth is welcome for the Japanese economy, but that doesn't mean the whole of Japan can benefit from it,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""What's important now is a recovery in service-sector activity helped by a progress on coronavirus vaccination.""

(Reuters) - U.S. applications for home mortgages increased last week on a pickup in homeowners seeking to refinance their loans, but requests for loans to purchase a house fell to a three-month low amid an acute shortage of housing stock that is driving up prices.
The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) said on Wednesday its seasonally adjusted Purchase Index increased 1.2% from a week earlier, reflecting a 4% rise in applications for refinancing. Refinancing activity has ticked higher in recent weeks as mortgage interest rates have pulled back from their recent highs. 
The purchase index decreased 4% from a week earlier to the lowest level since February, which may signal further headwinds for home sales in the months ahead.
""A decline in purchase applications was seen for both conventional and government loans,"" Joel Kan, an economist at the MBA, said in a statement. ""There continues to be strong demand for buying a home, but persistent supply shortages are constraining purchase activity, and building material shortages and higher costs are making it more difficult to increase supply.""
The housing market has been a strong performer in the economy throughout the COVID-19 recession, which started in February 2020. But supply constraints are slowing momentum. U.S. existing home sales fell to a seven-month low in March, but may have steadied in April, data due out Friday is expected to show. 

The average contract interest rate for traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 3.15% last week from 3.11% in the prior week, but rates remain roughly 20 basis points below their recent highs from early April. 
""Despite still relatively low rates, scarce inventory and soaring home prices are eroding affordability and putting homebuying out of reach for many households,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

365,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 07:12PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers' mood rises to highest since late 2018 - Reuters Tankan,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturers' business confidence hit a more than two-year high in May, as firms benefited from stronger overseas demand, a sign that the export-driven economic recovery remained intact, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.
Sentiment among service sector firms turned optimistic for the first time since early last year, according to the Reuters Tankan poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
""Orders to the United States and Europe are recovering as a trend, as coronavirus vaccinations are starting to progress,"" a manager at a paper maker wrote in the survey.
Still, the improvement in confidence was somewhat patchy, with firms saying they were feeling the drag from the coronavirus pandemic. Much of Japan, including Tokyo and Osaka, are under a state of emergency until the end of the month to try to counter COVID-19 infections.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers improved to 21 from 13 in the previous month, hitting its highest since December 2018, the poll conducted May 6-17 showed.
The service sector index expanded for the first time since February last year, rising to 2 from minus 3 in April, according to the survey of 482 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 236 firms responded on condition of anonymity.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.
""Competition among rivals has been increasing due to a decrease in private order volumes,"" a manager at a construction firm said. 
Another manager, at a services firm, said projects had been delayed or cancelled due to lower private-sector investor appetite, while public works orders were being held back in the greater Tokyo area due to the Olympics.
Japan is preparing to host the games in July although there are mounting concerns it could fuel a spike in COVID-19 infections.
Manufacturers' business confidence was especially boosted by improvements among chemicals, metal products and machinery, as well the electric machinery sectors, while the auto industry saw its sentiment expand at a less rapid rate.
""Production of new products coming about due to changes related to the coronavirus is making progress,"" a manager at a chemical maker said. ""Orders for parts related to such products are on the rise.""

Among non-manufacturers, the positive assessment of conditions was mainly due to an improvement among transport and utility firms, while the mood among retailers and wholesalers as well as other services firms remained negative, according to the survey.
Manufacturers' business confidence was seen unchanged at 21 in August, while that of service-sector firms was forecast to rise to 13, the poll showed.

366,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 19, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",Canadian Consumer Prices Climb at Fastest Pace in a Decade,"(Bloomberg) -- Consumer prices in Canada climbed in April at the fastest pace in a decade, beating estimates and potentially fueling concerns that the country is entering a period of persistent inflation.
Annual inflation accelerated to 3.4% in April, compared with 2.2% in March, Statistics Canada reported Wednesday in Ottawa. That beat economist predictions for a 3.2% annual pace. On a monthly basis, inflation rose 0.5% versus the 0.2% economists were expecting.
The annual reading -- the highest since May 2011 -- may raise some worries that price pressures could be stronger than predicted by the Bank of Canada, which has been cautioning against over-reacting to an inflation spike it expects will be only transitory. If inflation proves more durable, however, that could force the central bank to bring forward interest rate increases that investors aren’t anticipating until later next year.
Core inflation -- often seen as a better measure of underlying price pressures -- rose to 2.1% from 1.9% in March. That’s the highest reading since 2012.
The annual CPI reading is distorted because the year-ago period used as comparison coincided with broad demand and price declines at the beginning of the pandemic, a phenomenon known as the base effect. A similar effect also drove inflation higher in the U.S. last month to an annual 4.2% pace. Unlike in the U.S., inflation in Canada is rising at a slower pace because much of the country was still in some form of a Covid-related shutdown last month, stunting demand for goods and services.
Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem had predicted that inflation would rise to about 3% because of these base effects, but he also said he believes that underlying price pressures remain depressed because of continued slack in the economy. In its latest forecasts released last month, the central bank forecast inflation to average 2.9% in the second quarter before returning near its 2% target by the end of the year.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which tracks repeat sales of single-family homes, rose 2.4% in April from March. That was a marked increase from the gain of 1.5% in the previous month.
On an annual basis, the Teranet index was up 11.9% from a year earlier, the strongest 12-month gain since August 2017. Halifax, Nova Scotia, led the year-over-year gains, at 26.8%, followed by Hamilton, Ontario, at 22.9% and the national capital region of Ottawa-Gatineau at 19.5%.
Housing price gains in smaller cities outside Toronto and its immediate suburbs again outpaced the major urban centers, with cities like Barrie, Guelph and Kitchener posting annual gains in the range of 23.8% to 27.9%.

On a month-over-month basis, prices rose 5.4% in Halifax and 3.0% in Toronto, with Victoria, British Columbia, Ottawa-Gatineau and Hamilton all up 2.8%. Gains in the other major markets ranged from 0.4% to 2.0%. 
By contrast, data earlier this week from Canada's realtors showed prices and sales dropped in April compared with March, as some of the frenzy of recent months began to subside. Housing starts also fell in April.

368,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2021 07:53AM ET</span>",UK inflation more than doubles as post-lockdown price climb begins,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation more than doubled in April, the start of a likely climb in prices this year as rich economies recover from pandemic lockdowns, but one that the Bank of England hopes will prove temporary.
After U.S. inflation last week hit its highest level since 2008 and prompted Federal Reserve officials to say they were in no rush to raise interest rates, Britain's consumer price index rose by 1.5% in April.
That was a sharp jump from the 0.7% rise seen in March and marked the highest CPI reading since March 2020, driven by higher power and fuel bills as global oil prices climb from their pandemic lows of 2020.
April's inflation reading was, however, only a touch above the 1.4% rise seen in a Reuters poll of economists and was still below the Bank of England's 2% target.
This should give the central bank confidence, for now, that it won't have to pull the plug early on the trillion dollar bond-purchasing programme it rolled out to support the British economy through the crisis.
Inflation is likely to fall back next year as the comparisons with the coronavirus slump fades, most analysts say.
""If we're right in thinking the crisis won't leave a big scar on the economy, then the burst of inflation caused by reopening the economy should prove temporary,"" said Ruth Gregory, economist at consultancy Capital Economics.
Kallum Pickering, economist at Berenberg Bank, sounded a more cautionary note.
""We do not believe that higher inflation will be fully transitory as many in markets contend and as global central bankers seem to presume,"" he said. ""The rebound marks a turning point for inflation across the advanced economies following more than a decade of disinflation.""
The pound and interest rate futures markets were largely unmoved after the data. [GBP/] 
BOE WATCHING ""EXTREMELY CAREFULLY""
Higher electricity and gas bills - which jumped by more 9% in April - and rises in clothing and footwear prices helped to push British inflation up in April, along with the cost of petrol.
Core inflation, which excludes energy prices and other volatile items, increased less sharply than the headline figure, rising to 1.3% in the 12 months to April from 1.1% in March, the Office for National Statistics said.
The BoE says inflation will hit 2.5% at the end of 2021, pushed up in large part by the rise in oil prices and the expiry in September of COVID emergency cuts to value-added tax in the hospitality sector.
It thinks inflation will then slip back to 2% in 2022 and 2023.
But the BoE's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said earlier this month that the BoE needs to ""start tightening the tap to avoid the risk of a future inflationary flood,"" shortly after he cast a lone vote to scale back the BoE's bond-buying programme.
Governor Andrew Bailey said on Tuesday there had been little sign so far that higher costs for producers had fed much into consumer prices in Britain but the central bank was ""watching this extremely carefully and we will take action when we think it's appropriate to do so, no question about that.""

Wednesday's data showed prices paid by manufacturers for their inputs rose by 9.9%, the most since February 2017, while the prices they charged rose by 3.9%, the biggest increase in two-and-a-half years.
Separate ONS data showed rampant inflation in house prices: a 10.2% annual increase in March marked the strongest growth in house prices since August 2007.

House prices jumped by 10.2% from March, the strongest annual increase since August 2007, the Office for National Statistics said.
Other surveys have also shown the tax cut and a mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers further stoked a sharp surge in activity in the housing market which began after the first coronavirus pandemic was lifted last year.
Many Britons have sought to buy larger houses with gardens in less urban locations as they work more from home. 

The ONS said prices of detached houses rose by 11.7% in the year to March, compared with an increase of 5.0% for flats and maisonettes. 
London again saw the weakest gain in house prices among all of the United Kingdom's regions, with a 3.7% increase in the year to March. By contrast, prices in Yorkshire and the Humber region jumped by 14%.

Eurostat said consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.6% month-on-month for a 1.6% year-on-year increase, up from 1.3% year-on-year in March.
The European Central Bank wants to see inflation even closer to 2% over the medium term but has warned that the faster growth is mainly due to comparison effects with very low energy prices a year earlier.
Prices of energy, such as oil and gas, rose 10.4 year-on-year in April, adding 0.96 percentage point to the final inflation figure. On the other hand, costs of unprocessed food, another volatile component, fell 0.3% year-on-year in April.

Without these two sharply changing factors, or what the ECB calls core inflation, prices went up 0.5% in the month and 0.8% from a year earlier, slowing from the 1.0% annual growth in March.
But prices of services, which account for almost two thirds of euro zone gross domestic product, went up 0.9% year-on-year in April, adding 0.37 percentage point to the final inflation number, continuing a strong trend since the start of the year.

The DIHK's updated growth forecast compares with its previous estimate of 2.8% projected in February and is based on the latest findings of the association's survey among more than 27,000 companies from various sectors of the economy.
The DIHK forecast is less optimistic than the government's projection of 3.5% GDP growth this year. The German economy shrank by 4.8% last year due to the pandemic.
""There is cautious optimism among export-oriented industrial companies due to economic catch-up effects, but there is still a considerable amount of scepticism, particularly among the sectors affected by the lockdown, due to ongoing coronavirus restrictions,"" DIHK said in a summary of its survey.
Among the companies most upbeat were manufacturers of vehicles, machinery and electrical engineering products.
""One possible reason is the economic recovery in important sales markets such as China and the United States, which is boosting demand for ""Made in Germany"" goods,"" the DIHK said.
The survey revealed supply shortages of semiconductors and other industrial components which two out of five companies described as one of the biggest risks for their growth outlook.

""Delivery bottlenecks, trade restrictions and high global demand are currently causing prices to rise sharply, for example for wood, plastics, building materials and steel,"" DIHK said.
The DIHK survey chimes with the findings of the smaller, but more frequent Ifo business sentiment survey that showed how the third wave of COVID-19 infections and supply bottlenecks are complicating the economic recovery.

Sectors reporting severe disruptions, to inputs ranging from microchips and wood for construction, included the car and plastics industries as well as the textile, leather and construction industries.

The rapid pace of vaccination in Europe's largest economy, which would likely unleash sharp demand growth, might end up highlighting the supply problems, the institute warned.

373,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 11:02AM ET</span>",Surging lumber prices weigh on U.S. homebuilding,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding fell more than expected in April, likely pulled down by soaring prices for lumber and other materials, but construction remains supported by an acute shortage of previously owned homes on the market.
The plunge in homebuilding reported by the Commerce Department on Tuesday was concentrated in the single-family housing market segment. The number of houses authorized for construction but not yet started increased to the highest level since 1999, suggesting hesitancy on the part of builders.
""Builders are delaying starting new construction because of the marked increase in costs for lumber and other inputs,"" said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. ""These supply-chain constraints are holding back a housing market that should otherwise be picking up speed, given the strong demand for buying fueled by an improving job market and low mortgage rates.""
Housing starts tumbled 9.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.569 million units last month. Data for March was revised lower to a rate of 1.733 million units, still the highest level since June 2006, from the previously reported 1.739 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would fall to a rate of 1.710 million units in April.
Starts surged 67.3% on a year-on-year basis in April. Groundbreaking activity dropped in the Midwest and the densely populated South, but rose in the Northeast and West. 
Demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced millions of Americans to work from home and take classes remotely, has fueled a housing market boom. But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, leading to shortages of lumber and other raw materials, boosting prices and threatening to sideline first-time homebuyers from the market.
U.S. stocks were trading mixed and the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
LOW INVENTORY
The inventory of previously owned homes is near record lows. Tariffs on steel imports are also adding to building costs. Lumber prices surged 89.7% on a year-on-year basis in April, according to the latest producer price data.
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders holding steady in May. The NAHB noted that ""some builders are slowing sales to manage their own supply chains.""
According to an Institute for Supply Management survey published early this month, businesses in the construction industry reported challenges finding and retaining skilled and unskilled workers, with some companies saying ""we are not accepting all the work that we could if we had the labor.""
Permits for future homebuilding rose 0.3% to a rate of 1.760 million units in April. They soared 60.9% compared to April 2020, and are running ahead of starts, which suggests a rebound in homebuilding in the months ahead.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, dropped 13.4% to a rate of 1.087 million units in April. It retreated further below the more than 14-year high scaled in December, a sign that builders could be holding back because of the more expensive materials and lack of labor. 
Building permits for single-family homes fell 3.8% to a rate of 1.149 million units. The number of housing units authorized to be built but not started surged 5.0% to a rate of 232,000 at the end of April, the highest since the government started tracking the series in January 1999.
""It is currently somewhat uncertain when exactly supply issues could be resolved,"" said Isfar Munir, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Eventually, however, we expect that backlogs of demand could keep housing activity supported into the end of the year.""
The housing market has been the star performer in the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession, which started in February 2020. Residential construction investment has enjoyed double-digit growth since the third quarter of last year. Most economists expect housing will have a neutral impact on gross domestic product growth in the second quarter.
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment rose 0.8% to a pace of 482,000 units in April. Building permits for multi-family housing projects accelerated 8.9% to a rate of 611,000 units. With more than a third of the American population vaccinated against COVID-19 and restrictions on services businesses being lifted, people are flocking back to cities.
Housing completions fell 4.4% to a rate of 1.449 million units last month. Single-family home completions edged up 0.1% to a rate of 1.045 million units. 

Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction increased 0.6% to a rate of 1.312 million units last month.

The figures were in line with the initial flash estimate on April 30. Together with the GDP decline in the fourth quarter of 2020, of 0.7% in the quarter and 4.9% from a year earlier, the euro zone was in its second technical recession since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
The economies of Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands all contracted. France's grew by 0.4% quarter-on-quarter.
Eurostat also said that employment fell 0.3% on the quarter in the first three months of 2021 after a 0.4% quarterly rise in the previous quarter. This equated to a 2.1% year-on-year decline.
In separate release, Eurostat showed imports from Britain were down by more than a third in the first quarter of 2021 following the British exit from the EU single market.
The 27-nation bloc's trade surplus with Britain rose to 35.8 billion euros ($43.73 billion) as exports were down by a more modest 14.3%. The decline in exports and imports was most marked in January and less acute in March.
Eurostat said the euro zone's unadjusted trade surplus with the rest of the world fell to 15.8 billion euros in March from 29.9 billion euros in March 2020.

Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade surplus with the rest of the world was 13.0 billion euros in March from 23.1 billion euros in February as exports fell 0.3% on the month while imports rose 5.6%.

376,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>",Japan's economy slumps back into decline as COVID-19 hits spending,"By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's economy shrank more than expected in the first quarter as a slow vaccine rollout and new COVID-19 infections hit spending on items such as dining out and clothes, raising concerns the country will lag others emerging from the pandemic.
Capital expenditure also fell unexpectedly and export growth slowed sharply, a sign the world's third-largest economy is struggling for drivers to pull it out of the doldrums.
The dismal reading and extended state of emergency curbs have heightened the risk Japan may shrink again in the current quarter and slide back to recession, defined as two straight quarters of recession, some analysts say.
""Global chip shortages caused a marked slowdown in exports, putting a drag on capital spending as well,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""Consumption will probably remain stagnant, raising risks of an economic contraction in the current quarter.""
The economy shrank an annualised 5.1% in the first quarter, more than the forecast 4.6% contraction and following an 11.6% jump in the previous quarter, government data showed on Tuesday.
The decline was mainly due to a 1.4% drop in private consumption as state of emergency curbs to combat the pandemic hit spending for clothing and dining out.
But the bigger-than-expected contraction also reflected a surprise 1.4% drop in capital expenditure, which confounded market expectations for a 1.1% increase as companies scaled back spending on equipment for machinery and cars.
While exports grew 2.3% thanks to a rebound in global demand for cars and electronics, the pace of increase slowed sharply from the previous quarter's 11.7% gain, a worrying sign for an economy still reeling from weak domestic demand.
Domestic demand knocked 1.1% point off gross domestic product (GDP), while net exports shaved off 0.2 point, the data showed.
""That domestic demand is weak shows the adverse effects from the coronavirus haven't been shaken off at all,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Despite massive monetary and fiscal stimulus, Japan's economy slumped a record 4.6% in the fiscal year that ended in March, the data showed.
""There will undoubtedly be fiscal money poured on this problem to soften the blow, though after so much already, it is difficult to see this having more than a fairly marginal effect,"" analysts at ING wrote in a research note, adding they expect the economy to shrink again in the current quarter.
""And the Bank of Japan seems to be out of fresh policy stimulus ideas currently, so we don't anticipate anything new from them apart from extending existing measures.""
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura blamed the weak GDP reading mainly on the curbs to combat the pandemic, adding the economy still had ""potential"" to recover.
""It's true service spending will likely remain under pressure in April-June. But exports and output will benefit from a recovery in overseas growth,"" he told reporters.

Japan's economy expanded for two straight quarters after its worst postwar slump in April-June last year due to the initial hit from the pandemic.
The export-driven recovery came to a standstill as consumption took a hit from a spike in new virus strains that forced the government to re-impose curbs just 10 weeks before the Tokyo Olympic Games.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's unemployment rate fell again to 4.8% between January and March, when the country was under a tight lockdown, and hiring rose further in April, according to data that showed employers gearing up for the easing of curbs.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the rate to hold at 4.9%, and the reading added to signs that the labour market will escape the severe hit feared at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, thanks mostly to government jobs subsidies.
Some of the fall in the unemployment rate - the third in a row - was due to a rise in people not looking for work, with inactivity rate among men hitting a record high, echoing a pattern seen during Britain's first lockdown last year.
But analysts said the data showed the labour market was preparing for the end of many of the curbs imposed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in January, thanks to the country's swift COVID-19 vaccination programme.
""As the economy prepares to re-open fully and economic activity picks up, businesses have increased their hiring to meet the rise in demand,"" Yael  Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.
The unemployment rate was likely to peak at 5.9% in the three months to December, after a jobs furlough programme ends in September, she said.
The number of people in employment in the first three months of 2021 jumped by 84,000, the first increase since the pandemic hit Britain and a bigger rise than the Reuters poll forecast of a 50,000. Those classed as unemployed fell by 121,000.
APRIL HIRING INCREASE 
Separate data for April showed a further improvement in the labour market with people on company payrolls up 97,000 from March.
The rise was driven by hiring in the administration and support and the finance and insurance sectors, although the fall in hospitality - which partially reopened for outdoor service in April - was the smallest during the pandemic.
That narrowed the drop in payrolls numbers from February 2020 to 772,000, the Office for National Statistics said.
The Resolution Foundation think tank said that gap, combined with an estimated drop of 270,000 self-employed workers and 3.1 million workers still on furlough, meant Britain still had a 4.2 million 'COVID employment gap' to fill.
The payrolls data chimed with other recent signs of a hiring pick-up and there was a rise in job offers in hospitality and entertainment. 
However, some employers are struggling to fill vacancies with many foreign workers no longer in the country after the on-off closing and reopening of many firms over the past year, and as a result of Brexit.
The Bank of England this month slashed its forecasts for unemployment to show a peak of 5.4% in the third quarter after finance minister Rishi Sunak extended his jobs protection programme - which has cost more than 60 billion pounds ($85 billion) so far - until the end of September.
Britain's budget forecasters projected unemployment of 10% made shortly after the epidemic began.
Britain's headline measure of pay growth, including bonuses, rose 4.0% in the three months to March, slowing from 4.5% in the three months to February due to lower bonuses than a year ago.

The ONS said total pay growth, adjusted for a drop in the number of lower-paid and part-time jobs which have been hit hard by the pandemic, stood at 2.5%.

Gross domestic product shrank an annualized 5.1% from the prior quarter in the three months through March, ending a two-quarter streak of double-digit growth amid falling consumer spending and a drop in government outlays, the Cabinet Office reported Tuesday. Economists had forecast an overall contraction of 4.5%.
The worse-than-expected result comes at a critical time for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government as it struggles to contain virus cases with a targeted approach that limits the damage to the economy and a slow vaccine rollout.
Key Insights
“Looking ahead to 2Q, we see GDP resuming a slow pace of growth, assuming the latest state of emergency ends at the end of May as planned. Beyond that, the strength of the recovery will depend on how quickly vaccinations proceed and whether the Tokyo Olympics are held.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canadian home sales, prices and starts all fell in April compared with the previous month, as some of the frenzy of recent months began to unwind, though activity remains strong, data showed on Monday.
Canadian home sales fell 12.5% in April from March, while the average selling price was down 2.9% in April from the previous month, according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA).
Housing starts, meanwhile, fell 19.8% in April compared with March on a sharp decline in multiple urban starts, though starts remain well above pre-pandemic levels, separate data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) showed.
""While housing markets across Canada remain very active, there is growing evidence that some of the extreme imbalances of the last year are beginning to unwind,"" said CREA chair Cliff Stevenson in a statement.
Stevenson added that the decline in sales came amid a third wave of COVID-19 cases and fresh restrictions, which could somewhat obscure underlying levels of supply and demand.
Canada's housing market has been on tear in recent months, with home prices escalating sharply amid investor activity and fear of missing out. Even small cities and towns are grappling with red-hot markets usually reserved for major urban centers. 
Actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, rose 256% in April from a year earlier, CREA said. Sales and prices in April 2020 were sharply impacted by the first wave of COVID-19 and a strict nation-wide shutdown.
The national average selling price of a Canadian home was C$696,000 ($575,064) in April, falling 2.9% from March, but up 41.9% from a year earlier - again skewed by the ""base effect"" of the April 2020 decline, the industry group said. 
CREA's Home Price Index, which smoothes average price fluctuations, was up 23.1% on the year and up 2.4% from March.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts fell to 268,631 units in April from a revised 334,759 units in the previous month, the CMHC said. Analysts had expected 280,000 unit starts in April.

""Housing starts remained hot in April, just not at the scorching temperature from March,"" said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets, adding starts could continue to decelerate on high building costs and rising interest rates.

The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index was unchanged at 83 in May. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor.
""Builder confidence in the market remains strong due to a lack of resale inventory, low mortgage interest rates, and a growing demographic of prospective home buyers,"" NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke said in a statement. 
""However, first-time and first-generation home buyers are particularly at risk for losing a purchase due to cost hikes associated with increasingly scarce material availability.""
Demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced millions of Americans to work from home and take classes remotely, has fueled a housing market boom.
But the virus has disrupted labor supply at saw mills and ports, leading to shortages of lumber and other raw materials. Tariffs on steel imports are also adding to building costs. Lumber prices surged 89.7% on a year-on-year basis in April, according to the latest producer price data.
""Policymakers must take note and find ways to increase production of domestic building materials, including lumber and steel, and suspend tariffs on imports of construction materials,"" Fowke said. 
According to the NAHB, aggregate residential construction material costs increased 12% on an annual basis in recent months, and appeared to have risen further.

""Some builders are slowing sales to manage their own supply chains, which means growing affordability challenges for a market in critical need of more inventory,"" said Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.
Builders in many markets were also facing worker and land shortages, which could keep home prices elevated through this year. The survey's measure of current sales conditions was unchanged at 88, but its gauge of sales expectations over the next six months rose one point to 81. The component measuring traffic of prospective buyers fell one point to 73.

382,By Reuters,"<span>May 17, 2021 02:35AM ET</span>",China's factory output slows as bottlenecks crimp production,"By Kevin Yao and Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factories slowed their output growth in April and retail sales significantly missed expectations as officials warned of new problems affecting the recovery in the world's second-largest economy.
While China's exporters are enjoying strong demand, global supply chain bottlenecks and rising raw materials costs have weighed on production, cooling the blistering economic recovery from last year's COVID-19 slump.
Factory output grew 9.8% in April from a year ago, in line with forecasts but slower than the 14.1% surge in March, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Monday. Retail sales, meanwhile, rose 17.7%, much weaker than a forecast 24.9% uptick and the 34.2% surge in March.
NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said while China's economy showed a steady improvement in April, new problems are also emerging, notably the rise in international commodity prices.
""The foundations for the domestic economic recovery are not yet secure,"" Fu told a news briefing in Beijing on Monday.
""For companies as a whole, price increases are conducive to the improvement of corporate efficiency, but the pressure on downstream industries needs to be paid attention to,"" he added.
China's factory price inflation hit its highest pace since October 2017 in April. That could rise further in the second and third quarters, according to a report from the central bank last week.
The slower growth rates in the April activity indicators were also due in part due to the fading base effects as year-on-year comparisons rolled away from very sharp declines seen when the coronavirus shut down much of the country in early 2020.
In the factory sector, motor vehicle production growth fell sharply to 6.8% from 69.8%, due in part to the base effect as well as critical shortages of semiconductors used in car systems.
Growth in the production of cement slowed in April, and coal production fell on year, although aluminium and crude steel output hit record highs, helped by firm demand.
""China's economy shows signs of unbalanced recovery: strong exports and domestic investment on one hand, but weak consumption on the other,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note. 
Sectors related to travel, leisure and entertainment are large employers and still held back by COVID-19 uncertainty, he said.
Home appliances sales growth dropped particularly sharply in April from the month before, falling from 38.9% growth on year in March to 6.1%, NBS data showed.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note said month-on-month retail sales growth fell well below its pre-pandemic pace.
""Looking ahead, we think the rebound in consumption should gather pace again in the coming months as the labour market continues to tighten,"" he said.
TIME TO REASSESS?
China's economy expanded by a record 18.3% in the first quarter and many economists expect growth will exceed 8% this year.
Exports accelerated in April, thanks to strong demand for Chinese goods amid a brisk U.S. economic recovery and stalled factory production in other countries.
However, April also saw factory activity slow amid supply bottlenecks and rising costs and policymakers have acknowledged some of the recent weaknesses seen in the economic recovery.
""The cost of production has definitely increased, leading to a decrease in profits,"" said the manager of an automobile accessories factory in China's eastern Zhejiang province, surnamed Xu.
Sales are increasing but relatively slowly, and the factory plans to decrease production accordingly, he said.
A top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party said last month the country will encourage manufacturing and private investment to recover as quickly as possible.
The Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping also warned China's economic recovery remained uneven and that its foundation was not yet solid.
The activity indicators on Monday also showed fixed asset investment increased 19.9% in the first four months from the same period a year earlier, slowing from January-March's 25.6% increase.

Growth in real estate investment, property sales by floor area and new construction starts by floor area all cooled in the first four months compared to the first quarter, NBS data showed, amid increased scrutiny from policymakers on developers' financing activities.
""The government may put the monetary policy tightening on hold for now and observe the pace of recovery,"" Zhang from Pinpoint Asset Management said.

Investing.com – Chinese industrial output continued to improve in April but retail sales missed forecasts, in an indication of a lag in consumer spending.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day said that industrial production growth was 9.8% year-on-year in April, which matched the forecast prepared Investing.com but was lower than March’s 14.1%.
Meanwhile, retails sales increased 17.7% in April year-on-year, below both the 24.9% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 34.2% growth.
“We did see that retail sales continued to disappoint,” Jian Chang, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc told Bloomberg.
The drop is consistent with data over the week-long public holiday at the beginning of the month, which indicated people’s willingness to travel has recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels but actual spending was still lagging, she added.
Industrial output in China continued to improve as stimulus measures and accelerating vaccination rates boosted a global demand. However, the growth slowed in April due to supply shortage, rising raw material prices, as well as a push cut output to lower pollution in sections like steel and coal.
China's economy continued to improve in April but new problems are emerging, the NBS said in a statement alongside the data.
Top Chinese leaders have recently described the recovery as “unbalanced and unstable,” and pledged further efforts to boost domestic demand.
There is still a gap between actual and potential growth, indicating the economic recovery from COVID-19 still has a long way to go, NBS vice head Sheng Laiyun said earlier in the month.
The Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo warned in a meeting in April that China’s economic recovery was uneven and that its foundation was not yet solid. It also added that the government will promote manufacturing and private investment to recover as quickly as possible.
However, the party also pledged to gradually slow down the monetary and fiscal stimulus measures rolled out in 2020 during COVID-19, but with no sharp turn in policy."

Industrial output rose 9.8% in April from a year earlier versus the median estimate for a 10% increase. Retail sales expanded 17.7% in the period, far slower than a projected 25% rise. Fixed-asset investment grew 19.9% in the first four months of the year, in line with forecasts. The unemployment rate was lower at 5.1%.
While China’s economy has stabilized at a firmer footing in April, it’s still challenged by the pandemic and an uneven recovery globally as well as a fragile basis for recovery at home, the NBS said in a statement.
The nation’s top leaders recently described the recovery as “unbalanced and unstable,” pledging further efforts to drive a rebound in domestic demand. Sheng Laiyun, a vice head of the National Bureau of Statistics, said earlier this month there’s still a gap between actual and potential growth, suggesting the recovery has still some way to go.
“We did see that retail sales continued to disappoint,” Jian Chang, chief China economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc told Bloomberg TV. That’s consistent with data over the Labor Day public holiday at the beginning of May, which indicated people’s willingness to travel has recovered to pre-Covid levels but actual spending was still lagging, she said.
Manufacturing Investment
China’s stock benchmark CSI 300 Index extended gains to as much as 1.8%, with consumer discretionary and information technology sub-gauges leading the rally.
Industrial production remained robust on the back of a recovery in global demand, with fiscal stimulus and faster vaccine rollouts in many places helping to keep export growth strong. Rising raw material prices was likely a constraint in some areas, as is the push to cut output in sectors like steel and coal to lower pollution.
On a two-year average basis, which corrects for distortions from base effects, manufacturing investment was down 0.4% in the first four months of the year, while infrastructure investment was up 2.4% and property grew 8.4%. Retail sales growth on an average two-year basis softened to 4.3% in April from 6.3% in March, with the consumption of goods and catering services both turning weaker.
A separate report from the NBS suggests the property market remains strong, with home prices rising at the fastest pace in eight months in April.
Authorities have pledged a gradual scaling back of the monetary and fiscal stimulus pumped into the economy last year, with no sharp turn in policy. Recent data shows a notable slowdown in credit in April, suggesting the exit might be materializing at a faster-than-expected pace. The central bank injected medium-term cash into the financial system Monday to match the amount falling due, a move largely expected by analysts.
In March, the People’s Bank of China told banks to curtail loan growth in the coming months and keep it at roughly the same level as last year. The pace of local governments’ debt sales to finance infrastructure projects also slowed sharply in January to April compared to the same period in previous years, according to Bloomberg calculations.

385,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2021 09:11PM ET</span>",Japan April wholesale prices jump on rising material costs,"By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's wholesale prices rose in April at their fastest annual pace in six and a half years, data showed on Monday, a sign that rising energy and commodities costs were pinching corporate margins.
With the COVID-19 pandemic weighing on domestic consumption, there is uncertainty about whether companies would pass on higher costs to households and help the central bank achieve its elusive 2% inflation target, analysts say.
""The rise is driven mostly by solid global demand that is pushing up commodities prices,"" said Shigeru Shimizu, head of the BOJ's division in charge of price statistics, adding that prices of goods sensitive to domestic demand were rising only modestly so far.
The corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge one another for goods and services, rose 3.6% in April from a year earlier, Bank of Japan data showed, faster than a median market forecast for a 3.1% gain.
The rise, which followed a 1.2% increase in March, was the fastest pace of gain since September 2014 and was inflated partly by the base effect of last year's pandemic-related plunge.
April's increase was driven largely by higher commodities costs, with oil goods prices up 39.3% from a year earlier and nonferrous metals prices up 35.2%, the data showed.
In a sign the effect of rising U.S. housing demand was spreading globally, lumber and wood goods prices were up 4.7%.
Of the 744 items in the index, 339 saw prices rise, compared with 289 items that saw prices drop from the same period last year.
The number of components that saw prices rise exceeded that of those with falling prices for the first time in seven months.

Japanese companies have been slow in passing on higher costs to consumers, who are sensitive to price increases because of soft wage growth. That has hampered the BOJ's efforts to fire up consumer inflation to its 2% target.
The central bank's challenge has been made tougher by Japan's struggle to contain the pandemic. The world's third-largest economy is set to grow much more slowly than hoped this quarter because of extended state of emergency curbs to combat a resurgence in infections, a Reuters poll showed.

386,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",Some early U.S. data suggest May jobs report could echo April weakness,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some initial U.S. jobs data for May are showing signs of weakness, raising the possibility that April's disappointing employment report was not just a one-time blip. 
The closely watched May jobs report will be based on surveys that will ask businesses about levels of payroll employment as of this week. 
Hiring has recently stalled at a group of small businesses, according to high frequency data collected through May 9 by Homebase, which has been tracking employee time during the pandemic at a sample of around 54,000 restaurants, independent retailers and other small businesses. 
Measures of shift work at around 35,000 firms both large and small that are tracked by time management firm UKG foreshadowed the weak April jobs report. 
UKG data into May have shown work in the manufacturing, retail and health sectors all down. (Graphic: Jobs in real time Jobs in real time, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPENING/azgvoaggdvd/chart.png) 
""We should be prepared for another month of modest job creation,"" predicts UKG vice president Dave Gilberston. 
""People have spent the last 14 months rebuilding their lives around the pandemic. They’ve made alternative childcare and schooling arrangements, budgeted for reduced household income, and adjusted their lifestyle. While there seem to be 'help wanted' signs everywhere you look, it could be as late as September before we see hiring numbers truly surge.""
U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed in April, likely restrained by shortages of workers and raw materials, to just 266,000 jobs, far short of the nearly one million expected. 
The economy is still more than 8 million jobs short of where it was before the pandemic, and if such halting progress continues it will be years before the labor market recovers. (Graphic: The jobs hole facing Biden and the Fed, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOBS/xlbpgygrnpq/chart.png) 
Economists generally are still expecting strong job growth in the months to come, as people return to more normal activities - a prospect given a boost this week when U.S. health officials said those vaccinated against the coronavirus could stop wearing masks in most circumstances.
Oxford Economics Chief U.S. Economist Gregory Daco said that at this point he expected 500,000 to 750,000 new jobs to be added in May, and ""it may pick up.""
Other preliminary indicators about the strength of hiring and the economy overall are mixed. 

Jobless claims for the week ending May 8 fell slightly, but have been making only slow progress in recent weeks.
Consumer sentiment in early May tumbled as people worried about rising prices. Inflation expectations for the year ahead and over the next five years rose to their highest in more than a decade.

387,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales unchanged in April; prior month revised higher,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly stalled in April as the boost from stimulus checks faded, but an acceleration is likely in the coming months amid record savings and a reopening economy.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the unchanged reading in retail sales last month followed a 10.7% surge in March, an upward revision from the previously reported 9.7% increase.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 1.0%. Retail sales surged 51.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Last month's unchanged reading in sales came as a 2.9% rise in motor vehicles purchases was offset by declines in spending elsewhere. Sales at clothing stores tumbled 5.1%. There were also decreases in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at building material stores slipped 0.4%. Online retail sales fell 0.6%.
But consumers increased spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 3.0% rise in receipts. That followed a 13.5% jump in March. Sales at restaurants and bars are 116.8% higher compared to April 2020. 
Economists expect demand to swing back to services from goods as vaccinated Americans venture out to places like restaurants and bars after being cooped up at home for more than a year. Receipts at electronics and appliance stores rose 1.2%. Sales at furniture stores dropped 0.7%. 
Many qualified households received additional $1,400 checks in March, which were part of the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package approved early that month. 
Retail sales account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the other portion. Households have accumulated at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, which should underpin spending this year.
U.S. stocks were set to open higher. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
Coming on the heels of news this month that hiring slowed in April amid a shortage of workers, the weak sales could cause anxiety about the economic recovery. Though more than a third of Americans have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, fears about the virus linger and schools have not fully reopened for in-person learning, keeping many workers at home.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales dropped 1.5% last month after an upwardly revised 7.6% increase in March. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have shot up 6.9% in March.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, expanded at a 10.7% annualized rate in the first quarter, adding 7.02 percentage points to the economy's 6.4% annualized growth pace. 
Much of the surge in consumer spending last quarter occurred in March, which set a higher growth base for consumption heading into the second quarter.

The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell 5.5 points to a reading of 82.8, pulling back from the highest level in roughly a year in April. Economists polled by Reuters had been looking for a reading of 90.4, which would have marked the third straight monthly gain. 

Consumers' assessment of their current situation and their future outlook both soured, while their estimates for inflation shot up to 4.6% for this year and to 3.1% for the next 5 years - the highest in more than a decade for both.
""The average of net price mentions for buying conditions for homes, vehicles, and household durables were more negative than any time since the end of the last inflationary era in 1980,"" Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist, said in a statement.

389,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 10:34AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories rise moderately in March,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories increased moderately in March, likely restrained by shortages of raw materials, which have weighed on the production of motor vehicles and other goods.
Business inventories rose 0.3% after increasing 0.6% in February, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. March's gain was in line with economists' expectations.
Inventories were unchanged on a year-on-year basis in March.
Retail inventories decreased 1.4% in March as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.1% gain in February.
Motor vehicle inventories plunged 6.1% as previously reported. Motor vehicle stocks are dwindling as a global semiconductor shortage weighs on auto production.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.6% as estimated last month.
Business inventories were depleted in the first quarter amid a burst in domestic demand, fueled by a reopening economy and massive fiscal stimulus. Inputs shortages at factories as well as a scarcity of workers at ports to offload imported consumer goods could make it difficult for businesses to rebuild stock.
The inventory drawdown subtracted 2.64 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter. Still, the economy grew at a robust 6.4% annualized rate in the March-January period after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
Wholesale inventories rose 1.3% in March. Stocks at manufacturers gained 0.7%.
Business sales rebounded 5.7% in March after dropping 1.6% in February. At March's sales pace, it would take 1.23 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.30 months in February.

390,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing production rises in April,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Output at U.S. factories increased in April as operations at plants that were damaged by February's stormy weather in the South came back online, offsetting a decline in the production of motor vehicles.
Manufacturing production rose 0.4% last month after surging 3.1% in March, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. Manufacturing production remains a touch below its pre-pandemic level.
""An important contributor to the gain in factory output was the return to operation of plants that were damaged by February's severe weather in the south central region of the country and had remained offline in March,"" the Fed said. 
""The weather-induced drop in total industrial production in February and the subsequent rebound in March are now estimated to have been larger than reported last month.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would increase 0.4% in April. 
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being underpinned by massive fiscal stimulus and a shift in demand to goods from services because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
But the demand boom has led to a shortage of raw materials across the industry. The pandemic also is keeping some workers at home, adding to the supply constraints. 
A global semiconductor crunch has forced automakers in the United States to slash production. Output at auto plants dropped 4.3% in April. Excluding autos, manufacturing output rose 0.7%.
The rise in manufacturing output combined with a 2.6% increase in utilities to lift industrial production by 0.7% last month. That followed a 2.4% increase in March. Mining production gained 0.7%.

Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose to 74.1 from 73.8 in March. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector was up 0.5 percentage point to 74.9%. It is 4.7 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

391,By Investing.com,"<span>May 14, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","Retail Sales Stagnate in April, But Offset by Upward Revision to March Data","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Fears of the U.S. economy running hot receded on Friday after new data showed a slowdown in consumer spending in April.
Retail sales were flat on the month, falling short of expectations of a 1% gain. However, the monthly gain for March was revised up by a full percentage point to 10.7%., leaving aggregate spending roughly where economists expected it to be over the two months.
Core retail sales fell 0.8% on the month, rather than rising 0.7% as expected. Here too, the March figure was revised upward to a gain of 9.0% from an initial estimate of 8.4%.
James Knightley. chief international economist with ING, said via Twitter that the staged reopening of the economy also meant that spending was draining away from goods to services. 
""Re-opening means increased options for spending money, meaning a movement away from “things” to “experiences” that aren’t measured within retail sales,"" Knightley said.
The figures once again testified to idiosyncracies in consumer spending patterns as the economy emerges slowly and unevenly from the Covid-19 pandemic: sales at auto dealerships rose 3.1% on the month, corroborating the robust demand for cars that had also been evident in the sharp rise in prices for vehicles in April's inflation report earlier in the week.
By contrast, sales of apparel fell 5.1% and sales at hobby and sporting stores fell 3.6% on the month, having surged in March. 
March's data had been skewed by the effect of stimulus checks arriving at households across the country which, coupled with the start of economic reopening, had resulted in an explosion in overall spending.
""It was inevitable that there would be some declines in spending in April given that the vast majority of the $1,400 checks had already been paid out the previous month, but the details show sales in most categories reversing only part of their earlier surge,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior U.S. economist with Capital Economics in a note to clients.""
Hunter noted that spending on food and drink services rose 3% on the month, after surging 13.5% in March as bars and restaurants across the country reopened in growing numbers. It's now only 2% below its pre-pandemic peak, he argued.

The world's third-largest economy has recovered largely due to solid overseas demand that has boosted output and exports, even as a resurgence of coronavirus infections are dampening consumption.
Next week's key data include machinery orders and consumer and wholesale prices, as well as first-quarter gross domestic product figures that will be released on Tuesday.
Exports likely surged 30.9% in April from a year earlier, which would mark the sharpest monthly rise since May 2010, the poll of 18 economists showed.
Imports were forecast to have grown 8.8% in April from a year earlier, which would result in a trade surplus of 140.0 billion yen ($1.28 billion).
""Tightness in supply and demand of semiconductors seems to have a minor impact on exports so far,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Export values increased greatly, by 32.2%, in early and mid-April, in part in reaction to a sharp downturn in the same month last year.""
A slump in global trade due to supply chain disruptions from coronavirus lockdowns around the world delivered a heavy blow to Japan's trade-reliant economy in April last year.
The finance ministry announces trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday).
Core machinery orders data, which exclude those for ships and electrical utilities, are also set to be released on Wednesday.
The poll showed core machinery orders in March were expected to have decreased 2.6% from year-ago levels, and to have gained 6.4% compared to the previous month.

The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is expected to have fallen 0.2% in April compared to the same month a year earlier, according to the Reuters poll.

393,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2021 12:10AM ET</span>",Japan Q2 economic growth forecasts cut sharply on coronavirus restrictions: Reuters poll,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy is set to grow much slower than previously hoped this quarter, hobbled by extended emergency measures put in place to halt a rise in coronavirus infections, a Reuters poll showed.
It is likely to expand an annualised 1.7% this quarter, less than half the 4.7% projected last month, according to the poll of 33 economists conducted May 6-13.
Nearly all of the economists polled believe the government will compile an extra budget to support the world's third-largest economy, with 60% expecting it to come before the end of the third quarter.
A surge in infections due in part to new variants led to the government's decision to extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and three other areas until the end of the month and to expand it to two more prefectures, hitting consumer spending and broader activity.
""The pace of recovery appears to have been sluggish since the start of the year,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at the Japan Research Institute.
""But it's hard to imagine Japan's economy will fall into a deep contraction as attempts to suppress people's movements have become less effective.""
The economy likely shrank around 4.5% on an annualised basis in the first quarter, the poll showed. Preliminary GDP data is due on Tuesday.
For the full year, expectations have been revised down to a 3.6% growth from 3.9%, with economists also noting the slow pace of Japan's vaccination programme compared to other countries. For the next fiscal year, economists expect on average 2.4% growth.
""The vaccine rollout is pretty awful if you look at it from a global context. It's far behind that in Europe,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Japan has inoculated just 3% of its population, the lowest rate among the Group of Seven nations.
EXTRA BUDGET
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has faced growing calls from lawmakers, including ruling party heavyweight Toshihiro Nikai, to increase spending to support the economy. But he has so far expressed caution due to Japan's huge public debt and as the government has already compiled three pandemic-specific packages worth a combined $3 trillion.
Projections for the size of the economic package showed 12 economists expect it to range between 5 trillion yen to 10 trillion yen ($45 billion - $90 billion), 11 expect a package of 10-20 trillion yen while nine forecast 5 trillion yen or less.
Some economists said the timing of the extra budget would depend on the timing of a lower house election that has to be held by late October.
In years with major elections, Japan's government typically rolls out a stimulus package before or around the election to appeal to voters.
Eighty percent of analysts in the poll expected the Bank of Japan's next policy move to be an unwinding of stimulus with most not expecting this to happen until 2023 or later. That was roughly on par with last month's poll.
Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food prices, are set to only rise 0.3% this fiscal year, the poll showed, down from 0.4% projected in the previous month.

394,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2021 04:11PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims at 14-month low; inflation heating up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a 14-month low last week as companies held onto their workers amid a growing labor shortage that helped to curb employment growth in April.
The scramble for workers comes as the reopening economy is experiencing a boom in demand, resulting in widespread shortages of inputs at factories and fanning inflation. Producer prices increased more than expected in April, leading to the biggest annual gain since 2010, other data showed on Thursday. 
The worker shortage is despite nearly 10 million Americans being officially unemployed, a disconnect that economists expect will resolve in the coming months as increased vaccinations ease COVID-19 stress and enhanced unemployment benefits expire, allowing some workers to return to the labor market.
""With demand for workers high and layoffs relatively low, we should see strong hiring in the months to come, as barriers to employment, such as lack of childcare, lessen,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""For many, especially low-wage workers, returning to a job is a puzzle in which several pieces, such as transportation, wage levels and benefits must fall into place.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 34,000 to a seasonally adjusted 473,000 for the week ended May 8, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020, when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 490,000 applications for the latest week. The decrease in claims was led by Michigan, New York and Florida. 
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020, but remain well above the 200,000 to 250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. 
Some economists believe the enhanced unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 government subsidy, could be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved.
The economy created 266,000 jobs in April after adding 770,000 in March, which was partly blamed on the generous unemployment benefits. There are a record 8.1 million open jobs.
Several states in the South and Midwest, such as Tennessee and Missouri, that have unemployment rates below the national average of 6.1% have recently announced they will end federally funded pandemic unemployment benefits next month.
Economists cite the still-bloated jobless rolls as supporting the thesis that unemployment checks were keeping some workers home. There were 3.655 million people receiving benefits after an initial week in the week ended May 1, down 45,000 from the prior week. A total 16.9 million people were collecting unemployment checks under all programs at the end of April.
The government-funded benefits end in early September.
Richmond Federal Reserve president Thomas Barkin said on Thursday, ""the question of how to unclog the labor market is going to be a critical one,"" in keeping the recovery on track.
Stocks on Wall Street rebounded on the claims data after declining for three straight sessions. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
DEMAND BOOM
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief over the past year. More than a third of the population has been fully vaccinated, leading many states to lift most capacity restrictions on businesses.
The resulting pent-up demand is pushing against supply constraints. In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand rose 0.6% in April after surging 1.0% in March. 
A 0.6% increase in the cost of services accounted for about two-thirds of the rise in the PPI. Services, which increased 0.7% in March, were last month driven by higher prices for portfolio management, airline tickets and food retailing as well as physician care.
Goods prices gained 0.6%, lifted by an 18.4% jump in steel mill products. In the 12 months through April, the PPI shot up 6.2%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since the series was revamped in November 2010 and followed a 4.2% jump in March.
Part of acceleration in the PPI was due to last spring's weak readings dropping out of the calculation. The report followed on the heels of news on Wednesday that consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 12 years in April.
Though rising prices have spooked investors, the Federal Reserve has signaled it could tolerate higher inflation for some time to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its 2% target, a flexible average. 
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday it would be ""some time"" before the economy is healed enough for the U.S. central bank to consider scaling back its support. The Fed slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero last year and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. Its preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is at 1.8%.

""Each big inflation report for the next several months will test the Fed's approach to seeing through these issues it promises to be transitory,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Based on the CPI and PPI data, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is forecasting that core PCE increased 0.49% in April and 3.38% year-on-year.

Initial claims in regular state programs fell by 34,000 to 473,000 in the week ended May 8, Labor Department data showed Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for 490,000 claims. The prior week’s figure was revised up to 507,000.
The labor market continues to improve as more Americans get vaccinated and consumer demand picks up, helping spur economic activity. As more businesses and states lift remaining pandemic restrictions, hiring is expected to continue to accelerate.
Claims data have been volatile during the pandemic amid backlogs, fraud and new programs. Also, several states including South Carolina and Montana have recently said they plan to pull out of federal unemployment benefit programs amid a debate about whether generous aid is playing a role in why businesses are having a hard time hiring workers.

Online job adverts hit 107% of their pre-pandemic February 2020 level on May 7, up by four percentage points from two weeks earlier, figures from jobs website Adzuna showed.
Most sectors saw an increase in job ads with the biggest rise in hospitality, which has seen a 46 percentage-point leap in job ads since early April - before the sector reopened for outdoor customers.
Indoor service is due to resume on Monday, representing a big boost for the industry which has been among the hardest hit by the pandemic and the government's lockdowns to slow it.
There was also strong demand for workers in transport, logistics and warehousing which rose by 18 percentage points over the two weeks to May 7 to 235% of its February 2020 level, adding to a rise since the start of the year.
""It is thought that jobs within this sector are taking longer to fill and accumulating, which is contributing in-part to the higher overall vacancy numbers for this category,"" the ONS said.
Other figures published by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday showed spending on British credit and debit cards in the week to May 6 was 106% of its February 2020 level, up from 99% a week earlier.
The ONS said the figures showed consumers were spending more on travel, eating out and other activities that are being freed up from coronavirus rules.
The Bank of England expects a rise in spending by consumers, who accumulated savings during lockdowns over the past year, will help drive growth of more than 7% in Britain's economy in 2021 after its almost 10% slump in 2020.

The proportion of the workforce on the government's job-protecting furlough scheme was 11% in the period between April 19 and May 2, down from a previous reading of 13%, the ONS said.
A net 7% of 34,940 firms surveyed by the ONS reported an increase in turnover in March compared with March 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - A measure of British house price inflation hit its highest level since the late 1980s in April as buyers raced to take advantage of an extended tax break just as sellers retreated from the market, a survey showed on Thursday.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' gauge of house prices - which reflects the proportion of surveyors reporting price increases - jumped in April to +75, its highest level since 1988, from +62 in March.
Other indicators have also shown that a surge in the housing market was given fresh momentum by finance minister Rishi Sunak's announcement on March 3 that he was extending temporarily a cut to a tax on property purchases.
Sunak also announced a new mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers who cannot afford large deposits.
RICS said new buyer demand was positive across every region for the first time this year. But new instructions from owners looking to sell slumped to -4 from +21 in March.
""Housing supply, or more pertinently, the shortfall in supply relative to demand is the key theme coming through loud and clear,"" Simon Rubinsohn, RICS's chief economist, said.
""While it may be simplistic to assume that higher numbers alone can redress the affordability issue, particularly in a low interest rate environment, an uplift in delivery does have a role to play.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government said on Tuesday it would create a simpler and faster planning system to speed up the construction of new homes, a frequent promise of British governments.
Sunak cut the stamp duty purchase tax last year as part of his emergency measures to help the economy through its coronavirus slump. 
Demand for bigger homes after the experience of lockdown has also driven a surge in demand since last spring, a phenomenon seen in other countries too.

RICS said there were signs that the renewed rush to buy homes would ease off when the tax break is scaled back in June and ends completely in September.
Only a net 12% of respondents in its survey thought the sales volumes would rise over the next year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector confidence fell at the sharpest pace in a year in April, a Cabinet Office survey showed on Thursday, as curbs aimed at containing a resurgence of COVID-19 infections depressed consumer spending. 
Japan put in place a third state of emergency in Tokyo and some other areas late last month and has extended the measures until the end of May as the country struggles to contain a fourth wave of infections.
Analysts expect gross domestic product data due next Tuesday to show the world's third largest economy shrank in January-March as the curbs hit face-to-face service activity hard.
As private consumption accounts for more than half of the economy, the outlook for the current quarter appears dark as well.
""Household sentiment turned out particularly weak as more and more people have refrained from unnecessary outings and shopping,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
Thursday's survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called the ""economy watchers"" index for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions fell 9.9 points from the previous month to 39.1 in April.
It was the first decline in three months.
All the component indexes measuring sentiment at households, businesses and employment worsened, the survey showed. 
The Cabinet Office cut its view on the survey for the first time in three months, saying that the economy remains severe due to the pandemic and a pick-up will be weak. As for the outlook, it said anxiety is mounting over virus developments.
A year ago the index plunged to 7.9, the lowest level since the survey began in 2000, as the economy took a hard hit from the first wave of the pandemic and suffered its worst post-war slump.

The outlook index, indicating the level of confidence in future conditions, fell 8.1 points to 41.7 in April, down for a second straight month.
""Given the latest emergency, private consumption will likely remain stagnant in May as well,"" Nomura's Kuwahara said.

The Treasury Department said that the deficit for the first seven months of fiscal 2021 still hit a new record of $1.932 trillion, a 30% increase from the same period of fiscal 2020.
April receipts rose 82% from a year earlier to $439 billion, but the increase is partly due to last year's deferral of income tax payments to July. The Treasury deferred tax payments this year by only one month, until May 17, with no deferral for corporate taxes.

April outlays were $665 billion, a decrease of 32% from April 2020, as that month contained the bulk of payments to individuals in the first round of coronavirus rescue aid. Payments under President Joe Biden's stimulus plan this year were mainly sent in March.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nearly 12 years in April as booming demand amid a reopening economy pushed against supply constraints, which could add fuel to financial market fears of a lengthy period of higher inflation.
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed a strong buildup of underlying price pressures, extending a stocks selloff on Wall Street. Most economists were, however, unwavering in their belief that the surge in prices would be temporary, noting that the main drivers of the bigger-than-expected inflation increase were hotels and airlines, industries that were hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Bottlenecks in the supply chain, which led to a record jump in prices of used cars and trucks last month, were expected to ease. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has similar views.
""This is not a sign of an inflation problem,"" said Robert Barbera, director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Financial Economics. ""We have the capacity to produce this stuff, we simply need time to get things back on line.""
The consumer price index jumped 0.8% last month, the largest gain since June 2009. The CPI rose 0.6% in March. A 10.0% surge in prices of used cars and trucks, the most since the series started in 1953, accounted for over a third of the increase in the CPI last month. That followed a 0.5% rise in March. Motor vehicle production has been hampered by a global semiconductor chip shortage, boosting demand for used automobiles. 
Food prices increased 0.4%, lifted by rises in the cost of fruits and vegetables, dairy products, meats, fish and eggs. Households also paid more to dine out. But gasoline prices fell 1.4% after accelerating 9.1% in March. 
A sharp rebound is likely after hackers shut down the Colonial Pipeline on Friday, leaving gas stations from Florida to Virginia running dry and prices at the pump surging this week.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would climb 0.2%. In the 12 months through April, the CPI shot up 4.2%. That was the largest gain since September 2008 and followed a 2.6% increase in March. The jump mostly reflected the dropping of last spring's weak readings from the calculation. 
Those so-called base effects are expected to push annual inflation even higher in the months ahead.
Stocks on Wall Street fell, building on the previous session's losses, as investors worried that surging inflation could force the Fed to raise interest rates sooner than expected. The dollar strengthened against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
""At the very least, this report demands extra work from the Fed to assuage markets it is standing its ground and why,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. (Graphic: Inflation, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yzdvxzqdrvx/inflation.png) 
BROAD PRICE INCREASES
The U.S. central bank slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero last year and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. It has signaled it could tolerate higher inflation for some time to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its 2% target, a flexible average.
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Wednesday it would be ""some time"" before the economy is healed enough for the central bank to consider scaling back its support.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index is at 1.8%.
Demand is being driven by nearly $6 trillion in government relief since the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States in March 2020 and the vaccination of more than a third of the population. There are concerns inflation could linger amid reports that companies are raising wages as they compete for scarce workers.
Though job openings are at a record 8.1 million and nearly 10 million people are officially unemployed, companies are scrambling for labor. Generous unemployment benefits, fears of contracting the virus, parents still at home caring for children and pandemic-related retirements have been blamed for the disconnect. Average hourly earnings jumped in April.
Economists are keeping an eye on fairly high inflation expectations, which some say could become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI soared 0.9% last month, the largest gain since April 1982. The so-called core CPI rose 0.3% in March. 
It was boosted by a 10.2% surge in prices of airline tickets as well as an 8.8% jump in the cost of rooms in hotels and motels. The cost of renting a car soared 16.2%. Rental companies offloaded their fleets at the height of the pandemic and the semiconductor shortage is making it harder to restock.
Further increases are likely as these tourism categories remain below their pre-pandemic levels. Prices for new motor vehicles increased 0.5%. Consumers also paid more for recreation, motor vehicle insurance and household furnishings. But healthcare costs edged up 0.1% for a second straight month.

In the 12 months through April, the core CPI jumped 3.0%, also boosted by base effects. That was the biggest increase since January 1996 and followed a 1.6% advance in March.
""Put together with potentially higher wage inflation, higher inflation may be stickier than the Fed expects,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management in New York.

Investing.com -- U.S. inflation surged to its highest rate since the eve of the 2008 financial crisis in April, as last year's collapse in oil prices and a nascent economic recovery combined to generate the kind of number that many market participants have feared.
The consumer price index rose 4.2% from a year ago, according to government data released on Wednesday, well above consensus forecasts for 3.6%. However, the 0.8% rise in prices in April alone made clear that the spike wasn't entirely a result of distortions from last year, when crude oil prices briefly dipped below zero against a Covid-19-driven collapse in demand. 
Even when stripped of some of their more volatile elements, the data were ugly: the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.9% on the month, its biggest monthly rise since the early 1980s. That left core inflation running at a rate of 3.0%.
The biggest factor behind the jump appeared to be a 10% rise in prices for used cars and trucks, which was in turn due to various factors such as the reopening of more of the economy, an aversion to using mass transit amid lingering infection risks, and a shortage of inventory from the auto industry because of the global chip shortage. That rise was the biggest since the government started tracking it in 1953 and it accounted for over a third of the seasonally-adjusted increase in the overall price level.
Other items that the Department of Labor Statistics said had a big impact on the numbers were housing, airline fares, recreation, vehicle insurance, and household furnishings.
The data had an immediate impact on expectations for monetary policy, despite repeated assurances from the Federal Reserve that it will 'look through' what it considers to be a transitory spike in prices. Reuters reported that short-term interest rate futures now reflect 100% certainty that the Fed will hike rate by the end of next year, rather than wait until 2023, as its official guidance indicates.  The yield on the 10-Year Treasury bond meanwhile rose some 5 basis points to 1.66%, a two-week high. The Treasury is due to auction some $41 billion of 10-year notes later Wednesday.
The Fed has indicated it doesn't expect a problem with the general level of prices, which it sees as different in nature from the abrupt shifts in relative prices for certain categories of goods and services as consumer spending patterns adapt to the reopening of the economy. For the present, it is more concerned about the level of slack in the labor market, where over 16 million people are still claiming benefits related to unemployment, and the pace of hiring fell well short of expectations in April
“The outlook is bright, but risks remain, and we are far from our goals,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said on Tuesday. “Remaining patient through the transitory surge (in prices) associated with reopening will help ensure that the underlying economic momentum that will be needed to reach our goals . . . is not curtailed by a premature tightening of financial conditions. ”The numbers come against a backdrop in which a growing number of data points suggest greater price pressure ahead. Commodity prices have been on a tear all year, with lumber – a key input for housing construction costs – more than doubling since the start of the year.
However, analysts argue that the Fed is unlikely to be swayed, not least since the central bank prefers to take its cues from a different measure of inflation, the personal consumer expenditures price index. This index responds more quickly to shifts in consumer spending patterns and is more correlated to the experience of those on lower incomes.
“Trend PCE (inflation) is still below 2%,” said Roberto Perli, head of global policy research at Cornerstone Macro and a former Fed staffer, via Twitter. “The Fed won’t be impressed, even aside from temporary factors.”"
402,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",Consumer Prices in U.S. Increase by Most Since 2009,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumer prices climbed in April by the most since 2009, amid a record increase in used-car costs and signaling a build-up in inflationary pressures as burgeoning demand gives companies latitude to pass on higher costs.
The consumer price index increased 0.8% from the prior month after a 0.6% gain in March, according to Labor Department data Wednesday. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core CPI rose 0.9% from March.
The median forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.2% in the CPI and a 0.3% gain in the core measure.
The annual CPI figure surged to 4.2%, distorted by the comparison to the pandemic-depressed index in April 2020. This phenomenon -- known as the base effect -- will skew the May figure as well, likely muddling the ongoing inflation debate.
While Federal Reserve officials and economists acknowledge the temporary boost, it’s unclear whether a more durable pickup in inflationary pressures is underway against a backdrop of soaring commodities costs, trillions of dollars in government economic stimulus and incipient signs of higher labor costs.
The core CPI measure, which was also biased higher by the base effect, rose 3% from 12 months ago. For the last year the annual core inflation metric has held below 2%.
Wednesday’s report offers insight into bubbling price pressures across parts of the economy. Wages have shown signs of picking up, and supply chain challenges have elongated delivery times and driven materials prices higher.

403,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2021 04:01AM ET</span>","UK economy, gearing up for recovery, grows more than expected in March","By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pandemic-battered economy grew more strongly than expected in March as it gathered speed for a bounce-back from its coronavirus slump of 2020, official data showed on Wednesday.
The 2.1% growth from February was led by the reopening of schools which, alongside COVID-19 testing and vaccinations, pushed up activity in the public sector and by retailers as consumers spent some of their lockdown savings.
There was also a burst of work in the construction sector ahead of the expiry of a tax break for home-buyers.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected monthly growth of 1.3% for world's fifth-biggest economy.
""Businesses and the government alike will feel this data marks a turning point,"" Ana Boata, head of macroeconomic research at trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, said.
""With the ongoing easing of restrictions, confirmed this week by the prime minister, there’s hope that this could be the start of a long hot summer for British businesses."" 
Over the first three months of 2021, when the country was under a third lockdown, gross domestic product shrank by 1.5%, the Office for National Statistics said.
Although a less severe hit than initially feared, Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it meant Britain almost certainly remained the laggard among the Group of Seven rich countries for the fourth quarter in a row.
However, British GDP looked on course grow by 5% in the April-to-June period ""which should mean that the UK finally hands over the wooden spoon to another G7 economy.""
The BoE said last week it expected the economy would recover quickly as the country speeds ahead with Europe's fastest vaccination programme and coronavirus restrictions are lifted.
Its forecast for 7.25% growth in 2021 would be the fastest since a Second World War rush to rearm although by comparison GDP collapsed by 9.8% in 2020, its deepest slump in over three centuries.
""Despite a difficult start to this year, economic growth in March is a promising sign of things to come,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said. 
""As we cautiously reopen the economy, I will continue to take all the steps necessary to support our recovery.""
Britain's economy remained 8.7% smaller than at the end of 2019. The BoE expects it will be back to its pre-pandemic size by the end of this year.

MORE REOPENING AHEAD
Prime Minister Boris Johnson allowed non-essential shops to reopen and outdoor hospitality to resume in April in England and there have been signs that the economy accelerated in response.
Further relaxations are due to take place next week before the lifting of almost all remaining restrictions in late June.
The ONS data showed Britain's dominant services industry grew by 1.9% in March from February, its strongest growth since last August, while manufacturing and construction also grew more strongly than expected by analysts in the Reuters poll. 
Separate trade figures showed Britain imported more goods from non-EU countries than EU countries during the first quarter for the first time since records began in 1997.
The ONS warned it was too soon to say if this was the start of a trend or just short-term disruption.

""Exports of goods to the EU continued to increase in March and are now almost back to their December level,"" ONS statistician Darren Morgan said. ""However, imports from Europe remain sluggish.""
Business investment fell by almost 12% in the January-March period. The ONS said some companies brought forward investment plans to late 2020 to avoid disruption caused by leaving the EU's Single Market while others delayed plans for early 2021 to take advantage of a new tax break that launched in April.

Sales reached 2.25 million vehicles in April, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.

Sales of new energy vehicles (NEVs), including battery-powered electric vehicles, plug-in petrol-electric hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles, maintained their strong sales momentum, jumping 180%, with 206,000 units sold in the month.
NEV makers, such as Nio (NYSE:NIO) Inc, Xpeng Inc and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, are expanding manufacturing capacity in China, encouraged by a policy of promoting greener vehicles to cut pollution.

405,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 02:11PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings hit record high in March,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings surged to a record high in March, further evidence that a shortage of workers was hampering job growth, even as nearly 10 million Americans are looking for employment.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday also showed layoffs dropping to a record low in March. The report could put pressure on the White House to review government-funded unemployment benefits programs, including a $300 weekly supplement, which pay more than most minimum wage jobs. 
The benefits were extended until early September as part of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic relief package approved in March. Alabama, Montana and South Carolina are ending government-funded pandemic unemployment benefits for residents next month. Those benefits cover the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment insurance programs. 
""As more restrictions are lifted throughout the country, more businesses are opening up,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""However, there seems to be a mismatch between businesses' eagerness to return to some semblance of pre-pandemic normality and many workers' hesitation to step back into the workforce.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, jumped 597,000 to 8.1 million on the last day of March, the highest since the series began in December 2000. The surge was led by the accommodation and food services sector, with 185,000 vacancies opening up. There were an additional 155,000 job openings in state and local government education. 
In the arts, entertainment and recreation industry, vacancies increased by 81,000 jobs. Vacancies also increased in manufacturing, trade, transportation and utilities industries as well as in finance. Job openings rose in the Northeast and Midwest regions. But vacancies dropped in the healthcare and social assistance industry.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 7.5 million in March. The job openings rate shot up to 5.3% from 5.0% in February. 
Companies are scrambling for labor to meet pent-up demand that has been unleashed by the massive fiscal stimulus and rapidly improving public health. A separate report from the NFIB on Tuesday showed small businesses reported record-high vacancies in April. The openings were for both skilled and unskilled labor. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

LAYOFFS AT RECORD LOW
The disconnect between the high unemployment and worker shortages has also been blamed on fears of contracting the virus even though all adult Americans can now access the COVID-19 vaccine. Some parents are still at home caring for children as schools gradually return to in-person learning. 
There have also been coronavirus-related retirements and others are making career changes because of the pandemic.
The government reported last Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs in April after rising 770,000 in March. Employment is 8.2 million jobs below its peak in February 2020 and 9.8 million people were recorded as officially unemployed in April.
Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday that while it was ""true that with the extension of the unemployment benefits people are in a financial position so that they can make those hard choices about whether they feel comfortable reentering or not,"" the benefits themselves are not causing the problem.
Mester said health concerns with vaccinations still nowhere near full uptake, difficulties accessing childcare and school closures were the key issues. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also pushed back against criticism that unemployment checks were keeping people at home. 
According to the JOLTS report, there were 1.2 unemployed people for every open job in March. That compares to 0.82 on the eve of the first wave of the pandemic lockdowns 13 months ago. 
Graphic: Job openings to unemployed, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOLTS/azgpogkqxpd/chart.png 
The JOLTS report showed hiring increased to 6 million in March from 5.8 million in the prior month. State and local government education hiring rose. There were also gains in educational services as well as mining and logging. The hiring rate climbed to 4.2% from 4.0% in February.
Economists expected the job openings and unemployment disconnection to resolve when the extended benefits lapse, companies raise wages and more Americans get vaccinated, though some worried raw material shortages could hold back hiring.
""Before long many more workers will come back into job-search as it becomes increasingly safe to pursue these public facing jobs ... and as wages rise to compensate for the extra risk of working in face-to-face places during the lingering pandemic,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. 
Graphic: Labor market index Labor market index, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/LABORINDEX/nmopaoxozpa/chart.png 
Layoffs dropped to a record low 1.5 million in March from 1.7 million in the prior month. Layoffs decreased by 93,000 in construction, which has been buoyed by strong demand for housing. The layoffs rate dropped to 1.0% from 1.2% in February. 

The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs rose to 3.5 million from 3.4 million in February. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.4%. 
The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. But the pandemic has forced millions of women to drop out of the labor force mostly because of problems related to child care.

406,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 03:20AM ET</span>","UK shoppers buy clothes for outdoor social life, holidays at home","LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers bought warm clothes to meet friends and family outdoors - part of a broader rise in retail spending last month as many shops re-opened - and people booked more summer holidays in the United Kingdom, surveys showed on Tuesday.
The British Retail Consortium said total sales were 7.3% higher in April than in the same month two years ago.
The BRC said comparisons with April 2019 gave a better sense of trends in the sector than its usual year-on-year sales measure which showed a jump of more than 50%, reflecting how the retail sector was largely shut in April 2020.
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said fashion retailers saw sales rise, particularly in outerwear and knitwear, as the public braved the cold spring weather to meet outdoors as pubs and restaurants partially reopened from April 12.
Furniture sales, which have risen due to increased home-working and booming residential property sales, were also up.
""However, this sales growth is fragile,"" Dickinson said. ""There is little competition for share of spending while parts of hospitality, leisure, and tourism remain restricted and inner cities and town centres continue to perform poorly as many people continue to work from home."" 
Separate figures from payment processor Barclaycard showed debit and card spending last month was 0.4% higher than April 2019, the first growth this year by that measure.
Spending on essential items rose 10.1%, the strongest growth since August last year, pushed up by an 18.5% jump in supermarket shopping.
Resorts and accommodation saw growth of 1.6% as many people considered taking their summer holidays in Britain while airlines and travel agents reported declines of more than 80% with foreign trips largely prohibited.
Spending on fuel showed a smaller decline as more people travelled to see friends and family.
Barclaycard was unable to provide comparisons with spending in April last year. 

Barclaycard's measure of consumer confidence in the economy rose to 36% in April from 28% in March, its highest since February 2020 which was shortly before the onset of the pandemic, echoing the latest GfK survey on consumer confidence. 
The consumer confidence survey was based on interviews with 2,000 people between April 24-26.

Germany let firms that were struggling with the crisis delay filing for bankruptcy from March last year - though critics said the policy would only end up propping up ""zombie companies"" with no viable future.
Insolvencies duly fell, hitting their lowest level since 1999 last year. But since October, Berlin has phased out the scheme. This year only firms awaiting state aid provided since November were exempt from filing - until this month.
The Statistics Office said the February figures meant ""that the economic problems of many businesses due to the coronavirus crisis were not yet reflected by an increase in reported business insolvencies.""
Tuesday's data release also showed a let-up in insolvencies making their way through the legal system in Europe's largest economy after a sharp increase in recent months.
The number of new insolvency proceedings, which give an indication of the future path of actual insolvencies, fell 17% in April from the prior month, provisional data showed. That followed a 37% increase in March.

The European Union's top economic watchdog said last month EU governments must step in to avert a wave of insolvencies by healthy companies that are struggling due to the pandemic.
But local critics who say the fall in insolvencies over the past year is proof in itself the state has done more than enough and that excessive support risks impeding what economic liberals hail as ""creative destruction"", the term popularised in the 1940s by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter to describe unviable firms folding to make way for more dynamic newcomers.

408,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2021 01:45AM ET</span>","China's factory-gate prices surge, but CPI growth still modest","By Stella Qiu and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory gate prices rose at the fastest rate in three and a half years in April as the world's second-largest economy gathers momentum after strong first-quarter growth, but economists downplayed the risks to inflation. 
Investors globally are increasingly worried that pandemic-driven stimulus measures could spark a rapid rise in inflation and force central banks to raise interest rates and take other tightening measures, potentially holding back economic recovery.
China's producer price index (PPI), a gauge of industrial profitability, rose 6.8% in April from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said, faster than a 6.5% rise tipped by a Reuters poll of analysts and a 4.4% rise in March.
However, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by a mild 0.9% on year, held down by weaker food prices, and analysts said the rising costs from soaring producer prices were unlikely to be fully passed on to consumers. 
""We still expect much of the recent surge in upstream price pressure to prove transitory, with industrial metal prices likely to drop back later this year as a tighter policy stance weighs on construction activity,"" Capital Economics analysts said in a note.
""We don't think inflation will rise to the point where it triggers a major policy shift"" by China's central bank, they added.
Chinese authorities have repeatedly said they will avoid sudden policy shifts that could derail economic recovery, but are slowly normalising policy and clamping down on property speculation in particular.
The sharp jump in producer prices included an 85.8% surge in oil and natural gas extraction from a year ago, while ferrous metals processing rose 30%, said Dong Lijuan, senior NBS statistician in a statement accompanying the data release.
Consumers could see some price rises ahead from a global chip shortage affecting goods such as home appliances, cars and computers, said Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING.
""We believe that the chip price increase has already pushed up prices of fridges, washing machines, TVs, laptops and car prices in April, which increased 0.6%-1.0% month-on-month,"" she said.
CPI STILL MILD
April's 0.9% CPI increase was up on a 0.4% rise in March, driven mostly by gains in non-food prices as the services sector recovered. It missed analysts' expectations for a 1.0% rise. 
Sheng Laiyun, a deputy director at NBS, said on Friday that China's full-year CPI is likely to be significantly below the official target of around 3%. 
Sheng attributed China's likely muted inflation to currently slow core inflation, economic fundamentals where supply has outstripped demand, relatively restrained macropolicy support, recovering pork supply and a limited pass-through effect from PPI to CPI. 
Food inflation remained weak. Prices dropped by 0.7% from a year earlier, unchanged from the previous month, weighed by falling pork prices as supply increased.

China's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by a record 18.3% in annual terms in the first quarter as the country recovers from the devastating impact of COVID-19. 
Many economists expect China's GDP growth to exceed 8% in 2021, although some warn that continuing global supply chain disruptions and higher comparison bases will sap some momentum in coming quarters.

409,By Investing.com,"<span>May 11, 2021 12:31AM ET</span>","Chinese Producer Prices Surge, but Consumer Prices Slow Down, Over Inflation","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s producer price jumped in April, but consumer inflation saw modest gains, as soaring commodity prices increased concerns about inflation.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that China’s producer price index (PPI) grew 6.8% year-on-year in April, the highest since October 2017. It exceeded the 6.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 4.4% growth.
Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3% month-on-month in April, lower than the 0.2% contraction in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but above March’s 0.5% decrease. The CPI grew 0.9% year-on-year, slightly below the 1.0% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com while remaining above March’s 0.4% growth.
The widening gap between the CPI and PPI “suggests an uneven recovery of the economy,” said Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) Ltd.
“Despite the commodity boom, the service sector has yet to catch up... wages are lagging and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will likely keep its policy stance 'largely neutral,'""  he added.
Investors are also concerned that a commodities boom in the world’s biggest exporter, which was driven by increasing global demand and supply shortages, will lead to inflation globally as manufacturers start passing on higher prices to retailers.
Some central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, maintain the view that any inflation is temporary. However, Chinese policymakers insist that it can limit the impact of commodity prices on the domestic economy and control price growth. Meanwhile, the government also pledged to limit costs to firms by taking further measures to control the raw materials market.
The PBOC is also looking to slow down its stimulus measures rolled out as COVID-19 spread in 2020, due to concerns over the buildup of debt. Economists also expect a slowdown of credit expansion instead of interest rate growth.
Meanwhile, the Communist Party’s Politburo said in April that it will not hand down any sharp reversal of macroeconomic policies.
While China targets to keep its consumer inflation at around 3% this year, the index is expected to be “significantly lower” than the official aim in 2021, said an NBS official."
410,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2021 09:54PM ET</span>",China’s Producer Prices Surge Alongside Soaring Commodities,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s factory-gate prices surged more than expected in April, supported by gains in commodity prices and a low base of comparison from last year, while consumer inflation remained relatively subdued.
The producer price index rose 6.8% from a year earlier, the highest since October 2017, following a 4.4% gain in March, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. The median forecast was for a 6.5% increase. Consumer prices increased 0.9% on year, slightly below the 1% gain projected by economists.
The commodities boom, fueled by rising global demand and supply shortages, has stoked concerns about inflation around the world. As the world’s biggest exporter, rising PPI in China is another risk to global inflation as manufacturers start passing on higher prices to retailers.
Central bankers from the U.S. Federal Reserve on down maintain that price gains are temporary. In China, policy makers insist the impact of commodity prices on the domestic economy will be limited and that price growth remains generally under control. Still, officials have pledged to strengthen controls on the raw materials market to limit costs to companies.

Consumer inflation remained relatively amid lower pork prices, a key element in the country’s CPI basket.
The People’s Bank of China is seeking to scale back the stimulus it pumped into the economy during the pandemic last year, worried by the build up of debt. Economists expect policy makers to slow the pace of credit expansion rather than raise interest rates. The Communist Party’s Politburo, the top decision-making body, said last month there won’t be any sharp reversal of macroeconomic policies.
China aims to keep its consumer inflation at around 3% this year, but an NBS official said in a recent interview that the headline index is expected to be “significantly lower” than the official target in 2021.

411,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 09:01PM ET</span>",Japan March household spending posts biggest monthly rise in 18 months,"(Removes duplicate paragraph)
By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending posted its biggest monthly gain in 18 months in March, data showed on Tuesday, as consumer demand rebounded strongly from the heavy blow it took from the worsening impact of the coronavirus pandemic last year.
But an extension of new state of emergency restrictions and slow vaccine rollouts are clouding the outlook for the world's third-largest economy, and was likely to keep spending under pressure.
Household spending surged 6.2% in March from a year earlier, after a 6.6% decline in February, government data showed, and was stronger than a median market forecast for a 1.5% gain in a Reuters poll.
The jump marked the biggest gain since September 2019, and was the first advance in four months.
The overall spending gain was mainly due to a rebound from last year's contraction, a government official said, when the health crisis wreaked havoc on economic activity.
The month-on-month figures were also positive, posting a 7.2% rise compared with a forecast of a 2.1% gain.
""The number of infections increased rapidly in April, so there will likely be a decline again,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
That was likely to be followed by a moderate pickup in spending in May and June, he said.
Demand for travel services rebounded strongly compared to a year earlier, but remained at a relatively low level, the data showed, as COVID-19 continued to weigh.
""Department stores were closed in April and people refrained from travelling,"" Minami added.
The data was unlikely to dispel worries that Japan's economic recovery lags that of other major economies after the government last week expanded emergency curbs to halt the latest rise in COVID-19 infections.

The Japanese government has already deployed huge monetary and fiscal stimulus to help the economy withstand a blow to global trade from the health crisis, and the heavy toll it has taken on consumer sentiment which has hurt services spending.

412,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2021 11:27AM ET</span>","U.S. consumers expect near-term inflation bump, medium-term outlook steady","(Reuters) - U.S. consumers expect housing prices and other costs to rise in the near term as the economy recovers from the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but they don't expect the inflation bump to last, according to a survey released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
Consumers surveyed in April said they expect inflation to rise by a median of 3.4% over the next year - the highest level since September 2013. Expectations for inflation over the next three years were unchanged at 3.1%. 
Fed officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, say they expect near-term pricing pressures to diminish as supply bottlenecks are resolved and distortions related to sharp price declines at the start of the pandemic last year fade from inflation calculations.
The findings from the New York Fed's monthly survey of consumer expectations suggest some people also expect the inflation bump to be short-lived. 
The housing boom fueled by low interest rates and a desire for more living space is expected to continue, with median year-ahead price growth expectations at a new series high. 
Rental cost expectations increased for the fifth consecutive month and are now expected to rise by 9.5% over the next year, also reaching a series high. 
Some modest relief is expected in gas prices, which are now expected to rise by a median of 9.2% over the next year, down from a high of 9.9% in March. 

The survey is based on a rotating panel of about 1,300 households.
Consumers lowered their expectations for future earnings and spending. Income growth expectations dropped across age groups and education levels to a median of 2.4% in April. Spending growth expectations dropped slightly to a median 4.6% in April from a six -year high level of 4.7% in March.

“It looks like we have moved past the rebound phase of the recovery and are now seeing healthy growth in most of the economy,” said Oster, chief economist at NAB. “It is increasingly likely the expectations for business investment we have seen in our surveys and the Australian Bureau of Statistics data will materialize. It should also result in ongoing employment growth.”
The Reserve Bank of Australia closely monitors sentiment surveys and will likely be encouraged by the positive signal for higher investment and hiring. The central bank and government pumped stimulus to help shield the economy from the pandemic and have pledged to keep up support as they bid for maximum employment to revive wage growth and inflation.
The RBA says it’s likely to keep interest rates near zero until at least 2024 as it tries to achieve those goals. The government meantime is expected to announce more infrastructure and employment-heavy aged care spending in Tuesday’s budget as it also maintains support for hiring.
“Price pressures appear to be building with survey measures trending higher, but for now official measures and the inflation outlook remain soft,” NAB said in the release.

415,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 05:31PM ET</span>","U.S. hiring takes big step back as businesses scramble for workers, raw materials","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth unexpectedly slowed in April, likely curbed by shortages of workers and raw materials as rapidly improving public health and massive government aid fueled an economic boom.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday, which showed a plunge in temporary help jobs - a harbinger for future hiring - as well as decreases in manufacturing, retail and courier services employment, sparked a heated debate about the generosity of unemployment benefits. 
The enhanced jobless benefits, including a government-funded $300 weekly supplement, pay more than most minimum wage jobs. The benefits were extended until early September as part of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic relief package approved in March. Montana and South Carolina are ending government-funded pandemic unemployment benefits for residents next month. 
Economists say some workers could still be fearful of returning to work even as all adult Americans are now eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccinations. Others also cited problems with child care as in-person classes remain limited in many school districts. Labor and input shortages have been well documented by business surveys.
""The employment gain is understated in part because of the generous largess from Washington,"" said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""Short-staffed restaurant owners are working overtime, truck drivers are impossible to find even after a hefty increase in hourly wages and loading docks at warehouses are keeping trucks idle as there aren't enough workers."" 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs last month. Data for March was revised down to show 770,000 jobs added instead of 916,000 as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would advance by 978,000 jobs. 
That left employment 8.2 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the government to scrap the weekly unemployment subsidy, but the White House dismissed complaints the generous unemployment checks were causing worker shortages.
""It's clear that there are people who are not ready and able to go back into the labor force,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. ""I don't think the addition to unemployment compensation is really the factor that is making a difference."" 
Graphic: Nonfarm payrolls - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdvzowqkpw/nfpr.png 
Twelve months ago, the economy purged a record 20.679 million jobs as it reeled from mandatory closures of nonessential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections. That plunge could have thrown off the model that the government uses to adjust the data for seasonal fluctuations, resulting in the April payrolls number being below forecasts.
Unadjusted payrolls increased by 1.089 million jobs after rising by 1.176 million in March.
""We have warned frequently that the COVID-19 shock last spring would echo through the seasonally adjusted data and cause significant volatility,"" said Scott Ruesterholz, portfolio manager at Insight Investment in New York. ""That is likely what is happening with this report.""
The report did not change expectations that the economy entered the second quarter with strong momentum and was on track for its best performance this year in almost four decades. Timely labor market indicators, like new claims for jobless benefits, which last week dropped below 500,000 for the first time since the pandemic started, suggest payrolls will pick up.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was weaker against a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell.
ROBUST DEMAND
With more Americans vaccinated, many states have lifted most restrictions on businesses. That, together with $1,400 stimulus checks sent to qualifying households in March, unleashed pent-up demand. Supply chains were already strained by the shift in demand toward goods from services during the pandemic. 
The burst in demand contributed to the economy's 6.4% annualized growth pace in the first quarter, the second-fastest since the third quarter of 2003. With households sitting on at least $2.3 trillion in excess savings, economists were steadfast in their expectations for double-digit growth this quarter.
""The only thing keeping job gains down is supply, not demand,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The economy is racing forward and that is what we should focus on.""  
Graphic: U.S. labor market by sector - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/UNEMPLOYMENT/xegpbagnqvq/USA-ECONOMY-LABOR-SECTOR.jpg 
Leisure and hospitality gained 331,000 jobs in April, with hiring at restaurants and bars accounting for more than half of the increase. Government employment picked up as some school districts hired more teachers for in-person learning. 
But temporary help services employment dropped by 111,400 jobs. Manufacturing employment fell by 18,000 jobs, with payrolls at motor vehicle manufacturers dropping 27,000. A global semiconductor chip shortage has forced production cuts. 
In the transportation and warehousing industry, employment for couriers and messengers fell by 77,000. Retail employment dropped by 15,300 jobs. Construction payrolls were flat. With workers scarce, employers boosted wages and increased hours for employees. Average hourly earnings jumped 0.7% after dipping 0.1% in March. The average workweek rose 0.1 hour to 35 hours.
The unemployment rate rose to 6.1% in April from 6.0% in March as 430,000 people entered the labor force. The jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Without this misclassification, the unemployment rate would have been 6.4% in April. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, climbed to 61.7% from 61.5% in March. It was, however, lifted by men. Women, who account for most of the at least 4 million people still outside the labor force, dropped out.

That could bolster President Joe Biden's plan to spend another $4 trillion on education and childcare, middle- and low-income families, infrastructure and jobs. It also supports the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance.
""The road to full employment may be a bit longer than we all thought,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

416,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 10:58AM ET</span>",U.S. wholesale inventories rise solidly in March,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories rose sightly less than initially estimated in March as sales surged amid robust demand.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories increased 1.3%, instead of 1.4% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers gained 1.0% in February. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product increased 1.3% in March.
Wholesale inventories shot up 4.5% in March from a year earlier. Sales at wholesalers jumped 4.6% after being unchanged in February.

Overall, business inventories were depleted in the first quarter amid a burst in domestic demand. The inventory drawdown subtracted 2.64 percentage points from GDP growth last quarter. Still, the economy grew at a robust 6.4% annualized rate in the March-January period after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
At March's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to clear shelves, down from 1.26 months in February.

417,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 09:47AM ET</span>",Canada posts hefty job losses in April as third wave bites,"By Julie Gordon
OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada lost more jobs than expected in April as fresh restrictions to contain a variant-driven third wave of COVID-19 weighed on employers, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday. 
Some 207,100 jobs were lost in April, more than the average analyst prediction for a loss of 175,000. The unemployment rate climbed to 8.1%, missing analyst expectations of 7.8%. Employment is now 2.6% below pre-pandemic levels.
""This episode seemed to be a little more impactful in that it led to a big decline in full-time jobs and specifically in private-sector employment,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. 
""There were some heavy hits in education and culture and recreation. So it seems like the third wave bit into other sectors a little bit more deeply than the second wave."" 
Full-time employment was down by 129,400 while part-time employment fell by 77,800 positions. 
With many retailers shuttered in April and the restrictions also hitting hotels, food services and entertainment, service sector employment plunged by 195,400 jobs. Employment in the goods sector fell by 11,800.
As COVID-19 infections surged in April, a number of Canadian provinces imposed fresh restrictions, including shuttering or limiting non-essential businesses and closing schools. Cases are beginning to decline, but reopening is still weeks away and economists expect further job losses in May.
Canada has so far fully vaccinated just over 3% of its nearly 38 million residents, while more than 36% have received a first dose. By the end of June, Canada expects to have received 40 million doses.
Long-term unemployment increased by 4.6% to 486,000 people, which suggests some labor market scarring is beginning to show, said Leah Nord, a senior director at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
""The job prospects for displaced workers grow slimmer with every month in lockdown as more businesses throw in the towel,"" she said in a statement. 
Total hours worked fell 2.7% in April, while the number of people working less than half their usual hours jumped 27.2% to 288,000. 
""The hours worked numbers were I think weaker than had been expected,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategists at TD Securities. ""I think it suggests a weaker April than the Bank of Canada would have had penciled in.""

The Bank of Canada in April sharply boosted its outlook for the Canadian economy and signaled interest rates could start to rise in 2022.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% lower at 1.2187 to the greenback, or 82.05 U.S. cents, after touching on Thursday its strongest level in 3-1/2 years at 1.2141.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers hired far fewer workers than expected in April, likely frustrated by labor shortages, leaving them scrambling to met booming demand as the economy reopens amid rapidly improving public health and massive financial help from the government.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 266,000 jobs last month after rising by 770,000 in March, the Labor Department said in its closely watched employment report on Friday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls advancing by 978,000 jobs.
The jobs report, the first since the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package was approved in March, will probably do little to change expectations that the economy entered the second quarter with strong momentum and was on track for its best performance this year in almost four decades. 
Twelve months ago, the economy purged a record 20.679 million jobs as it reeled from mandatory closures of nonessential businesses to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections. New claims for unemployment benefits have dropped below 500,000 for the first-time since the pandemic started.
Americans over the age of 16 are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, leading states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to lift most of their coronavirus capacity restrictions on businesses. 
But the resulting burst in demand, which contributed to the economy's 6.4% annualized growth pace in the first quarter, the second-fastest since the third quarter of 2003, has triggered shortages of labor and raw materials.
From manufacturing to restaurants, employers are scrambling for workers. A range of factors, including parents still at home caring for children, coronavirus-related retirements and generous unemployment checks, are blamed for the labor shortages. The moderate pace of hiring could last at least until September when the enhanced unemployment benefits run out. 

The labor market remains supported by very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy. President Joe Biden plans to spend another $4 trillion on education and childcare, middle- and low-income families, infrastructure and jobs. The Federal Reserve has signaled it intends to leave its benchmark interest rate near zero and continue to pump money into the economy through bond purchases for a while.
The unemployment rate rose to 6.1% in April from 6.0% in March. The jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Millions of Americans remain out of work and many have permanently lost jobs because of the pandemic.

419,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2021 08:37AM ET</span>","Payrolls Shock: Only 266k Nonfarm Jobs Added in April, vs 978k Expected","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. economy created far fewer jobs in April than estimated, casting doubt over the strength of the economic recovery. 
The Labor Department said only 266,000 net nonfarm payrolls were added through the middle of last month, compared to expectations for a number just under 1 million. In addition, the March payrolls gain was revised down by a whopping 146,000 to 770,000.
The unemployment rate rose to 6.1% of the workforce from 6.0% in March. Analysts had expected it to fall to 5.8%.
There was no indication as to why the government's data were so starkly at odds with other evidence in recent days and weeks suggesting a more vigorous recovery. Data collection for ADP's private-sector hiring survey generally has the same cut-off date as the government's, and ADP had reported a net increase of 742,000 private-sector jobs in the month, compared with the government's estimate of only 218,000. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing payrolls fell by 18,000 month-on-month, something that stands at odds with the ISM's monthly survey, whose employment index has been well above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction all year.
Some economists, at least, were skeptical of the figures' accuracy.
""Ignore the hot-takes and emails dissecting the data. Just put on your steepener and clock out for the weekend,"" said Robin Brooks, an economist with the Institute for International Finance in Washington, DC. ""This negative NFP surprise is just noise and doesn't invalidate for a second that U.S. GDP is booming hugely.""
A steepener is a trade that bets on shorter-dated bonds outperform longer-dated ones, reflecting expectations of higher inflation at a time of low official interest rates.
Market reaction to the news was abrupt, as cyclical stocks, oil and bond yields all headed lower.
However, Nasdaq futures gained on expectations that the Federal Reserve will resist any temptation to consider easing off on its asset purchases this year. Earlier this week, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan had become the first senior Fed official to suggest that the time to discuss tapering bond purchases had already arrived.
For the Fed, we suspect that means it will be a many months before it judges the economy has made “substantial further progress” towards its “broad based and inclusive” full employment goal,"" Michael Pearce, senior economist with Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. ""That means any talk of tapering, let alone rate hikes, is still some way off.""
By 8:50 AM ET (1250 GMT), Dow Jones futures, which have outperformed in recent weeks as ‘reopening trades’ have brought beaten-down cyclical names back into fashion, were down 0.1%.

420,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>",China posts rapid trade growth in April as recovery races ahead,"By Stella Qiu and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China extended its impressive trade performance in April, with exports unexpectedly accelerating and import growth hitting a decade high, in a boost to the world's second-largest economy.
A brisk U.S. economic recovery and stalled factory production in other countries hit by coronavirus have propped up demand for goods made in China, analysts say.
Exports in dollar terms surged 32.3% from a year earlier to $263.92 billion, China's General Administration of Customs said on Friday, beating analysts' forecast of 24.1% and the 30.6% growth reported in March.
""China's export growth again surprised on the upside,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, adding that two factors - the booming U.S. economy and the COVID-19 crisis in India, causing some orders to shift to China - likely contributed to the strong export growth.
""We expect China's export growth will stay strong into the second half of this year, as the two factors above will likely continue to favour Chinese manufacturers. Exports will be a key pillar for growth in China this year.""
The numbers helped push the yuan and stocks in China and other Asian markets higher.
Imports were also impressive, rising 43.1% from a year earlier, the fastest gain since January 2011 and picking up from the 38.1% growth in March. It was also slightly faster than the 42.5% rise tipped by the Reuters poll, bolstered by higher commodity prices.
But Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management, said it remains to be seen if strong import growth, mainly driven by price inflation, could be sustained as China winds down its fiscal policy support.
""It must be noted that the fast year-on-year growth today was largely due to the negative growth a year ago. The two-year average growth was only about 10%, which is not that strong.""
Indeed, import volumes for some products are starting to level off. China's iron ore imports fell 3.5% in April from a month earlier, while copper imports dropped 12.2% on the month.
China's trade surplus of $42.85 billion was wider than a $28.1 billion surplus tipped in the Reuters poll.
SLOWING MOMENTUM
However, analysts still expect China's economic growth to slow from the record 18.3% expansion in the January-March quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts global supply chains, slowing movement of goods and driving up shipment costs.
""Despite the upbeat demand outlook and policy support, supply-side constraints including the global chip shortage, shipping disruption, container shortages, and skyrocketing freight rates are expected to persist for some time,"" said Christina Zhu, Economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in a note on Thursday.
A persistent shortage of semiconductors needed for a wide range of products including consumer electronics and cars is also starting to hurt manufacturers, weighing on production.

Etelec electronics, a Zhongshan-based manufacturer of LED lights, stopped taking on new orders from April 26, due to a shortage in integrated circuits, the company announced in a statement seen by Reuters.
China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index last week showed factory activity growth slowed in April from a month earlier as supply bottlenecks hit production.

The IHS Markit/CIPS Construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 61.6 in April from 61.7 in March, despite the survey's gauge of new orders rising to its highest level since September 2014.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 62.3.
""The UK construction sector is experiencing its strongest growth phase for six-and-a-half years, with the recovery now evenly balanced across the house building, commercial and civil engineering categories,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at data company IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.
Overall the survey added to signs that the economy is on track for a swift rebound. On Thursday the Bank of England said Britain's economy, which last year shrank by almost 10%, would grow by the most since World War Two this year.
The all-sector PMI, which combines the PMI surveys for manufacturing, services and construction surveys, rose to 60.8 in April from 56.8 in March, the highest since October 2013.
IHS Markit said that in the construction sector, civil engineering showed its fastest growth since 2014 while the expansion cooled off in the commercial and housebuilding sectors. The latter was boosted by a housing market boom spurred in part by a temporary cut to property purchase tax.
Cost pressures for construction firms increased at the sharpest rate since records started 24 years ago.

""Supply and demand imbalances for construction items, alongside higher transport costs, resulted in severe price pressures across the board during April,"" Moore said.
Employment growth in construction companies was the highest since late 2015, the survey showed - chiming with a Recruitment and Employment Confederation report that showed a rapid increase in demand for staff from employers.

Investing.com – China’s services activities expanded at their highest speed in four months in April, with a little help from a huge trade surplus.
Data released earlier in the day said that the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for April was 56.3, higher than March’s 54.3 reading.
The figure comes after disappointing data released during the previous week, including the Caixin manufacturing PMI for April was 51.9, above the 50.8 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 50.6 reading. Additional data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that the manufacturing PMI for April was 51.1, lower than both the 51.7 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 51.9 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 54.9, also below its March reading of 56.3.
The growth was attributed to the successful curb of COVID-19 cases in the country and ever-increasing demand due to the first global business growth in three months. Meanwhile, total new orders lead to new hiring in services firms.
However, the survey warned that inflation worsened due to a sharper rate of input costs in April, which was driven by higher labor costs and raw material prices.
“Inflation will be a focus in the future. Inflationary pressure was evident as input costs and output prices in manufacturing and services have continued to increase for several months,” said Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note.
“In the coming months, rising raw material prices and imported inflation are expected to limit policy choices and become a major obstacle to the sustained economic recovery,” the note added.
Meanwhile, China’s trade sector also contributed to the growth of the economy.
NBS data said that exports grew 32.3% in April year-on-year, higher than the 24.1 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 30.6% growth. Imports jumped 43.1%, higher than both the predicted 42.5% and March’s 38.1% growth.
The trade surplus was $42.86 billion for the month, higher than the forecast $28.10 billion and March’s $13.80 billion.
The jump in exports was accredited to some countries introducing stimulus measures and global reliance on China's role as the world’s biggest exporter. Meanwhile, imports rose due to a low base in 2020, as well as strong domestic demand and higher commodity prices.
China also pledged to accelerate recovery in domestic demand, which is neither even nor solid, during the previous week’s Chinese Communist Party’s Politburo meeting.
“Looking beyond the pandemic, we think China will continue to rebalance in order to rely more on domestic demand in the longer term and while gradually upgrade itself in the global supply chain,” Liu Peiqian, a China economist at Natwest Group Plc., said in a note."

The monthly index of demand for staff from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and accountants KPMG rose this month to its highest level in just over 23 years. Permanent staff placements grew at the fastest rate since October 1997.
Non-essential retailers in England reopened on April 12 along with pubs and restaurants operating outdoors, and from May 17 more restrictions are due to be lifted to allow indoor hospitality, performances and sporting events.
While the labour market remains a long way from its pre-pandemic state, the REC survey adds to signs that a swift recovery is underway, helped by Britain's swift roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines.
""We are bouncing back from a record low – and many people are still struggling – but the data shows that job creation is firing up again,"" said Neil Carberry, REC's chief executive.

""The message for government and employers alike is that the long-term challenge is less likely to be high unemployment than attracting and training enough staff to keep our economy firing.""
The survey came a day after the Bank of England said it now expected unemployment to rise only slightly to a peak of 5.4% in the third quarter of this year.

The decline extends a volatile period for solar sector jobs, which have yet to return to a peak reached in 2016 before the United States imposed tariffs on foreign-made panels that increased prices.
Still, the solar sector is among the fastest-growing segments of the U.S. energy industry, driven by demand from governments and businesses seeking to source cheap, emissions-free power to satisfy customer, taxpayer and investor demands to address climate change.
There were 231,474 workers in the U.S. solar industry in 2020, according to the annual report from the Solar Energy Industries Association trade group, down from 248,034 in 2019.
Stay-at-home orders and a weakened economy slowed demand for solar, particularly in the labor-intensive residential sector, it said. 
Labor productivity also rose 19% and 32% in the residential and utility-scale markets, respectively, due to shifts to online selling and an increase in the average size of projects.
Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the association, said she expected the decline to be temporary.
""We will see lots more jobs created this year,"" she said.
President Joe Biden has pledged to decarbonize the U.S. economy by 2050, including the power sector by 2035. It will take 900,000 solar workers to meet that goal, the analysis found.
While Biden has promised his clean energy push will create union jobs that pay well, skeptics note that solar jobs currently come with lower wages and are less likely to be union-represented than those in the oil and gas industries.

About 10% of the solar industry is unionized, the report found, just below the U.S. average.
In addition to SEIA, the report was published by the non-profits The Solar Foundation and the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, as well as the workforce research firm BW Research.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell below 500,000 last week for the first since the COVID-19 pandemic started more than a year ago, signaling the labor market recovery had entered a new phase amid a booming economy.
That was reinforced by other data on Thursday showing U.S.-based employers in April announced the fewest job cuts in nearly 21 years. The reports added to other upbeat employment data in suggesting that the economy enjoyed another blockbuster month of job growth in April. 
But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with about 16.2 million people still collecting unemployment checks.
""Although unemployment remains elevated, the labor market is rapidly recovering,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 92,000 to a seasonally adjusted 498,000 for the week ended May 1, the Labor Department said. That was the lowest since mid-March 2020, when mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 540,000 applications for the latest week. The decline in claims was led by Virginia, Florida, New York and California.

The massive fiscal stimulus and rapidly improving public health situation are unleashing pent-up demand, resulting in a scramble for workers by companies. 
Reports on Wednesday showed private employers hired the most workers in seven months on April, while a measure of services industry jobs rose to more than a 2-1/2-year high. Consumers' perceptions of the labor market are the strongest in 13 months.

PRODUCTIVITY REBOUNDS
In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said layoffs announced by U.S.-based employers fell 25% in April to 22,913, the fewest since June 2000. Planned layoffs so far this year are down 84% from the same period in 2020. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 978,000 jobs last month after rising by 916,000 in March. That would leave employment about 7.5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
Estimates range from as low as 656,000 to as high as 2.1 million jobs. The Labor Department will publish April's employment report on Friday. 
Jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. They are, however, well above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. 
Part of the elevation has been blamed on fraud as well as the enhancement of the unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 subsidy, which could be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 605,884 people filed for claims last week. These benefits and the weekly subsidy end in early September. They have been blamed for worker shortages across many industries.
""The government is paying more to be on the unemployment rolls than the private sector is paying to work at their businesses,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The choice is clear, at least until the enhanced benefits run out.""

The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 37,000 to 3.690 million in the week ended April 24. About 5.0 million people were on government-funded extended benefits during the week ended April 17. Another 453,653 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid.
There were 16.2 million people receiving benefits under all programs in mid-April. With economic activity strengthening, worker productivity is rebounding, which should help to protect profits as companies face higher input costs caused by the robust demand and a shortage of materials and labor. 
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, rebounded at a 5.4% annualized rate last quarter. Productivity contracted at a 3.8% rate in the final three months of 2020, the sharpest since the fourth quarter of 1990.
""We expect productivity to strengthen in coming quarters and remain well supported as the economy experiences a mini-boom in activity and the labor market lags the overall economic recovery,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 

""Stronger productivity gains should buffer companies' bottom lines against rising input costs and further boost profit growth this year amid an expected surge in companies' sales.""
Gross domestic product is expected to rise above its pre-pandemic level this quarter, while most economists expect a full recovery in employment in the second half of 2022.

426,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 09:36AM ET</span>",U.S. productivity rebounds in first quarter,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. worker productivity rebounded in the first quarter, depressing labor costs growth, but the data has been severely distorted by the COVID-19 pandemic to provide a clear trend.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 5.4% annualized rate last quarter. Data for the fourth quarter was revised higher to show productivity falling at a 3.8% rate instead of the previously reported 4.2% pace. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity would rebound at a 4.3% rate. Productivity shot up early in the pandemic before slumping in the final three months of 2020. Economists attributed the surge to the hollowing out of lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which they said tended to be less productive. 
Compared to the first quarter of 2020, productivity rose at a 4.1% pace. Hours worked increased at a 2.9% rate last quarter, slowing from a 10.0% growth pace in the October-December period.

Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - fell at a 0.3% rate. They grew at a 5.6% pace in the fourth quarter. Unit labor costs increased at a 1.6% rate from a year ago. They have also been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries.
Hourly compensation rose at a 5.1% rate last quarter. That followed a 1.6% growth pace in the fourth quarter. Compensation increased at a 5.8% rate compared to the first quarter of 2020.

427,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2021 08:39AM ET</span>",Initial Jobless Claims Drop to New Post-Pandemic Low as Recovery Strengthens,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The number of initial claims for jobless benefits dropped to a new post-pandemic low last week in a further sign that the economic recovery is gaining strength.
Initial claims fell to 498,000 from an upwardly revised 590,000 the week before. Analysts had expected a figure of 540,000. The revision to last week's figures all but neutralized the positive 'surprise' on this week's number.
The number of people making continuing claims for regular state benefits rose unexpectedly to  3.690 million from 3.653 million. These numbers are reported with a one-month lag to the initial claims numbers. The broader measure of people claiming under all unemployment-related benefit programs, including those set up to deal with the pandemic emergency, fell by just over 400,000 to 16.157 million. These numbers are reported with an additional week's lag. 
The Labor Department's data are consistent with the pattern in ADP's private payrolls survey for April, which showed 742,000 net job additions last month, the most since September. 
""This is a large acceleration in improvement from Feb–Mar to now—a positive sign,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist with Glassdoor, via Twitter.
The reopening of the hospitality sector in particular has eased the pressure on labor-intensive industries in recent weeks. According to ADP, some 237,000 people were hired by the sector last month. Although the numbers don't map exactly, ADP's figures are a good omen for the government's official labor market report for April, which is due for release on Friday.
Separately on Thursday, a regular but not exhaustive survey of layoffs across the country showed jobs being shed at their slowest rate since 2000. Challenger, Gray and Christmas' monthly report showed fewer than 23,000 job cuts last month, down from nearly 31,000 in March and a peak of 671,000 last year."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's services sector recorded its fastest growth in more than seven years last month as hospitality businesses and retailers began to reopen to the public after months of lockdown.
IHS Markit said its monthly Purchasing Managers' Index for the services sector rose to 61.0 in April from 56.3 in March, above an earlier flash estimate of 60.1.
Both the services PMI and a composite PMI which includes the smaller manufacturing sector were the highest since October 2013. New orders rose at the fastest pace since December 2013.
""A surge of pent-up demand has started to flow through the UK economy following the loosening of pandemic restrictions,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
The Bank of England is expected to revise up its growth forecasts for 2021 later on Thursday, reflecting the rapid roll-out of COVID vaccines in Britain and a very sharp drop in the number of new deaths and infections from the disease.
Non-essential retailers reopened to in-store shoppers across Britain last month and pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers seated outside. 
Indoor dining is expected to be allowed to resume in England on May 17 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government aims to remove most social distancing rules by late June.
""The roadmap for reopening leisure, hospitality and other customer-facing activities resulted in a sharp increase in forward bookings and new project starts across the service sector,"" Moore said.
Britain's economy suffered its biggest fall in output in more than 300 years in 2020 with a contraction of nearly 10% - bigger than most other advanced economies - and may take until early 2022 to recover to its pre-pandemic size.

Rapid growth - and ongoing global disruptions from COVID-19 and Brexit - is also creating inflation pressures. 
The PMI showed the biggest rise in costs for businesses since February 2017 and the strongest hiring in more than five years, creating staff shortages for the first time since the start of the pandemic.

429,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 03:55AM ET</span>",Surge in German orders to test factory bottlenecks,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) -Strong domestic demand for consumer goods propelled a bigger than expected jump in German industrial orders in March, data showed on Thursday in a sign that manufacturers will support a recovery once supply and delivery bottlenecks are overcome.
The German economy, Europe's largest, shrank by 1.7% in the first quarter as restrictions to contain the coronavirus stifled private consumption and chip shortages held back production in the automobile industry.
The data published by the Federal Statistics Offices showed orders for industrial goods 'Made in Germany' jumped on the month by 3% in seasonally adjusted terms.
This easily beat a Reuters forecast of 1.7% and came after an upwardly revised increase of 1.4% in February and a rise of 0.8% in January.
Domestic orders rose by 4.9% in March on the month while foreign bookings increased by 1.6%. The strong increase was driven by an unusually large number of major contracts. Without this effect, orders were up by 1.6%, the office said.
""The demand for German industrial goods is unbroken. This time, however, orders for big-ticket items also helped a lot,"" said Alexander Krueger from Bankhaus Lampe.
""The dilemma remains that orders are distributed faster than processed,"" Krueger said, pointing to the supply and delivery bottlenecks at automakers which have led to production cuts.
Looking at industrial sectors, the increase in the headline figure was mainly driven by strong demand for consumer goods which jumped by 8.5%, the economy ministry said.
Bookings for intermediate goods were up by 2.8% and those for capital goods rose by 2.5%.
Orders were particularly high in the sectors of mechanical engineering, manufacturing of data processing equipment and electronic and optical products, the ministry said.
In a sign that manufacturers are partly overcoming supply bottlenecks with semiconductors and other industrial components, real industrial sales rose by 2% on the month in calendar-adjusted terms, the statistics office said.
This points to an equally solid increase in industrial output for which data is due on Friday and economists forecast a 2.3% increase.
The continued positive trend in incoming orders is laying the foundation for a solid economic recovery in the coming months, Thomas Gitzel from VP Bank said.
""The shortage of materials is slowing down production for the time being, but once the materials are available again in sufficient quantities, there will be strong catch-up effects,"" Gitzel said.

The German government last week lifted its economic growth forecast for this year to 3.5% from 3% previously, counting on a rebound of household spending once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted in the course of the summer.
Still, the Bundesbank's chief economist told Reuters on Friday that he expected the supply bottlenecks in German industry to worsen in the second quarter which could lead to an overall weaker recovery this year.

430,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2021 01:46AM ET</span>",China's exports growth seen slowing as foreign demand softens,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports growth likely lost some momentum in April on moderating overseas demand and the fading base effect of the trade slump seen early last year, while higher commodity prices are expected to have kept a brisk pace of imports.
Exports are expected to have risen 24.1% in April from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 economists, slower than the 30.6% jump in March.
The forecast comes amid concerns recent stellar export growth will face short-term challenges as production in other exporting countries disrupted by the coronavirus resumes.
""The continued recovery in global demand that we expect will mostly benefit services rather than world goods trade, which is already above pre-virus levels,"" said analysts with Capital Economics. ""And China's share of global exports is likely to drop back as vaccines allow a return to more normal global consumption patterns.""
They noted China's export strength concentrated in shipments of electronics, furniture and recreational goods for home use, which have benefited from demand from the pandemic-induced lockdowns. 
Some exporters are also grappling with surging prices of raw materials, which are threatening to drag on profits and deter them from taking on new orders.
In another sign of the weaknesses to come, official factory surveys showed a gauge for new export orders slipped in April from the previous month.
Imports likely rose 42.5% in April versus a year ago, the poll showed, higher than the 38.1% gain in March.
""Import growth may surge in April from March mainly on a very low base, the ongoing domestic demand recovery, higher commodity prices and strong RMB appreciation since late May 2020,"" said analysts with Nomura.

China's trade surplus is expected to be $28.1 billion in April, following a surplus of $13.8 billion in March, the poll showed. The data will be released on Friday.
""Over the medium-term, we expect the downtrend of export growth to continue in coming months and the pace of its slowdown to be more significant in the second half of this year,"" Nomura analysts said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls surged by the most in seven months in April as companies rushed to boost production amid a surge in demand, suggesting the economy gained further momentum early in the second quarter, powered by massive government aid and rising COVID-19 vaccinations.
Strengthening labor market conditions were reinforced by other data on Wednesday showing a measure of services industry employment increased last month by the most in more than 2-1/2 years. The reports bolstered expectations for another month of blockbuster employment growth in April.
""The job market is picking up steam in the spring as consumers are more comfortable going out given vaccinations and stimulus checks,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
Private payrolls rose by 742,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since last September, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Companies hired 565,000 workers in March. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 800,000 jobs in April.
The acceleration in hiring was across the board, with the leisure and hospitality sector adding 237,000 jobs. Manufacturers hired 55,000 workers and payrolls in the construction sector increased by 41,000 jobs.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. It, however, likely understates the pace of job growth. 
Since the recovery from the pandemic started, ADP has underestimated the private payrolls count in the government's more comprehensive, and closely watched, employment report because of methodology differences. 
""The April ADP report is consistent with accelerating job growth, especially because the ADP panel methodology likely undercounts workers returning to their previous employers,"" economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note. ""We continue to expect larger gains in the official payroll measure.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.

WORKERS SHORTAGES 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its measure of services industry employment increased to a reading of 58.8 last month, the highest since September 2018, from 57.2 in March. 
The ISM survey suggested that hiring could have been even stronger if not for worker shortages. According to the ISM, businesses in the accommodation and food services industries reported ""competition for labor as more restaurants begin easing their restrictions and returning to normal levels.""
In construction, companies complained that ""finding and retaining labor, skilled and unskilled, is highly challenging and frustrating,"" and that ""as the challenges continue, we are not accepting all the work that we could if we had the labor."" 
Tight labor supply and shortages of inputs led to overall activity in the services industry growing at a slightly slower pace in April. The pandemic has shifted demand towards goods, leading to a shortage of raw materials. 
For a graphic on ISM PMI:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/rlgvdywwxpo/ism.png 
The labor market has improved significantly, with new claims for unemployment benefits dropping to the lowest level since March 2020 when mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
Consumers' perceptions of the labor market are the strongest in 13 months. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 978,000 jobs last month after rising by 916,000 in March. The Labor Department will publish April's employment report on Friday. But the scarcity of workers across industries could restrain hiring.
""The biggest downside risk to Friday's jobs report is the difficulty employers are having finding workers,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The broadening economic re-engagement is unleashing pent-up demand, which is expected to keep consumer spending robust, after it accelerated sharply in the first quarter. The economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate last quarter following a 4.3% pace of expansion in the fourth quarter.
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief over the past year. Americans over the age of 16 are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Many states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, are lifting most of their coronavirus capacity restrictions on businesses. 
Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7% this year. That would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.

""As states increasingly ease mitigation protocols and the U.S. flirts with herd immunity this summer, consumer spending will become less skewed in favor of goods consumption, which will help alleviate shortages of materials,"" said Bernard Yaros, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""Further vaccine progress will reduce fears of contracting and spreading COVID-19, which is holding back some 4 million adults from re-joining the workforce.""

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 62.7 last month from 63.7 in March, which was the highest on record.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 64.3 in April.
The findings mirrored the ISM's manufacturing survey published on Monday showing bottlenecks in the supply chain constraining factory activity in April. The economy is experiencing a boom in demand, thanks to the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to all adult Americans.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week the U.S. central bank expected the bottlenecks would be resolved as workers and businesses adapted, adding ""we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy."" The Fed has slashed its benchmark interest rate to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through bond purchases.
Inventories at businesses were drawn down in the first quarter as consumer spending soared. The economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the January-March quarter after expanding at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy for growth of at least 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.
Demand for services could surge in the coming months as vaccinated Americans go on vacations and visit theaters, among other activities. Many states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are lifting most of their coronavirus capacity restrictions on businesses. 
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry dropped to 63.2 in April from an all-time high of 67.2 in March. Backlogs of uncompleted work increased strongly, underscoring the impact of the supply constraints. 
Inventories contracted and businesses boosted imports. They continued to pay more for inputs. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries rose to 76.8, the highest reading since July 2008, from 74.0 in March.

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market continued its rapid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic in April, although a closely-watched survey suggested its progress was slightly weaker than expected.
Payrolls processor ADP said 742,000 people found nonfarm jobs in the private sector last month, the strongest monthly gain since September. The number was some 58,000 below expectations, albeit the previous month’s number was revised up by 48,000 to 565,000.
Net of revisions, the figure is only marginally below consensus forecasts and unlikely to change many market opinions on the pace of the U.S. economy’s recovery.
ADP’s figures come two days before the government’s official labor market report for the month through mid-April, a period in which dozens of states were relaxing restrictions on businesses in response to falling infection rates for Covid-19. Anecdotal reports suggest that the hospitality sector in particular has been quick to rehire. According to ADP, the hospitality accounted for 237,000 of the net jobs added.
At the same time, the Institute of Supply Management’s employment index for the manufacturing sector returned to a level last seen before Donald Trump stepped up his trade war with China in 2018. The ISM’s employment index continued to indicate robust job growth this month, but at a slightly slower pace.
The generally close correlation between ADP numbers and the government's numbers weakened markedly during the pandemic, but the numbers are still widely seen as a good proxy for overall trends in the labor market. The Labor Department is expected to announce on Friday that the economy overall added 978,000 jobs during the month through mid-April, up from 916,000 the previous month.
The Federal Reserve, which has made the labor market the labor market recovery the most important factor in its formulation of monetary policy, estimates that the economy is still currently more than eight million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level.
""ADP has tended to understate the official payroll numbers since the middle of last year, so this reading is consistent with a headline number Friday of about 1.1 million,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics in a note to clients. ""That would be a welcome uptick from the 916K increase in March, but the best is yet to come; we look for much bigger gains in May and - especially - June and July, by which point we expect the whole economy to be fully open."""

The jobless rate fell to 4.7% from 4.9% in the fourth quarter, Statistics New Zealand said Wednesday in Wellington. Economists expected 4.9%. Employment rose 0.6% from the previous three months, twice the 0.3% median forecast.
New Zealand business confidence rebounded in late 2020 after a V-shaped economic recovery, encouraging firms to hire more workers. While the jobless rate never hit the highs feared when the Covid-19 pandemic first hit, it is well short of the 4% levels attained in 2019. This adds to signs that the central bank will want to keep providing stimulus to the economy for some time.
The kiwi dollar jumped after the report. It bought 71.67 U.S. cents at 10:56 a.m. in Wellington from 71.50 cents immediately before the release.
The Reserve Bank, which is required to support maximum employment as well as stable inflation, has said it will require considerable time and patience to deliver those objectives. A few economists see scope for higher rates in 2022 but the consensus is the official cash rate will stay at a record low 0.25% until 2023.

435,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2021 04:12PM ET</span>",Robust domestic demand lifts U.S. trade deficit to record high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit jumped to a record high in March amid roaring domestic demand, which is drawing in imports, and the gap could widen further as the nation's economic activity rebounds faster than its global rivals.
Manufacturers lack the capacity to satisfy the surge in demand because of resource constraints and bottlenecks in the supply chain. Inventories are very lean. Demand is being driven by a rapidly improving public health situation and massive government aid to households and businesses to cushion the blow from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The widening of the trade gap will likely be a persistent feature of the economy this year as domestic demand outstrips the U.S. economy's productive capacity,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
The trade deficit increased 5.6% to an all-time high of $74.4 billion in March, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. The trade gap was in line with economists' expectations. 
Imports soared 6.3% to a historic $274.5 billion in March. Goods imports shot up 7.0% to $234.4 billion, also an all-time high. Imports of consumer goods were the highest on record, as were those for food and capital goods. 
The nation imported a range of goods including apparel, furniture, toys, semiconductors, motor vehicles, petroleum products and telecommunications equipment. But imports of civilian aircraft and cellphones fell. 
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in pandemic relief over the past year. Americans over the age of 16 years are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Demand during the pandemic shifted to goods from services, with Americans cooped up at home. The economic boom is also being boosted by the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
EXPORTS GAIN GROUND
The bulk of imports in March came from China, boosting the politically-sensitive goods trade deficit with Beijing to $27.69 billion from $24.62 billion in February, reversing a tariffs-driven improvement during the Trump administration.
""The widening in the trade balance with China over the last few months has erased the tightening that occurred over 2019 as a result of tariffs,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Imports from Mexico hit a record high in March, as did those from South Korea. 
Exports accelerated in March, but continued to lag the growth in imports. Exports surged 6.6% to $200.0 billion. Exports of goods vaulted 8.9% to $142.9 billion. 
They were led by industrial supplies and materials and capital and consumer goods. The pandemic remained a drag on trade services, especially travel. At $17.1 billion in March, the services surplus was the smallest since August 2012. 
Exports are expected to pick up later this year as global economic growth gains steam, allowing foreigners to buy more American goods. The resumption of international travel and in-person learning at U.S. universities in the fall is likely to result in an improvement in services trade.
""As vaccinations gain more momentum abroad and the global recovery gains pace, trade should begin to normalize,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Export growth should begin to rival import growth, which will remain supported by a surge in domestic consumer and business demand.""
Robust demand is boosting manufacturing. A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed factory orders increased 1.1% in March after falling 0.5% in February. Business spending on equipment was also stronger than initially thought. 
Despite the widening of the trade deficit, the economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter, the second-fastest gross domestic product growth pace since the third quarter of 2003, fueled by pent-up domestic demand. That followed a 4.3% growth pace in the fourth quarter. 

Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7% in 2021, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.
""The U.S. economy is poised to re-emerge from the pandemic early and forcefully thanks to a swift vaccination campaign,"" said Evan Karson, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Overall, companies based in Europe's largest economy have a greatly improved view of how business is going, the survey found, with 45% saying it was going well and only 14% saying it was going badly. Just over half expect business conditions to improve over the next 12 months.
The main tailwind is coming from problems in the supply chain: 40% of internationally active companies report problems obtaining components, a 9 percentage-point rise from last autumn.

""Over recent months, production outages and problems with shipping and a shortage of containers has led to disruptions in world trade,"" the Chambers of Commerce said. ""That has raised transport costs and lengthened delivery times.""
Some 71% of companies were planning changes to their supply chains in order to tackle this problem, the survey found.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that factory orders increased 1.1% in March after falling 0.5% in February. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rebounding 1.3%. Orders rose 6.6% on a year-on-year basis.
The White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to all adult Americans have led to a boom in demand, which is pushing against supply constraints. 
The Institute for Supply Management reported on Monday that manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in April, restrained by shortages of inputs. Robust consumer spending helped to lift gross domestic product growth at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter, which followed a 4.3% growth pace in the final three months of 2020.
Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years. 
Factory goods orders in March were boosted by strong demand for machinery, motor vehicles, fabricated and primary metal products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components decreased. Unfilled orders at factories rose 0.4% after surging 0.9% in February.

The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, jumped 1.2% in March instead of increasing 0.9% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 1.6%. They were previously reported to have rebounded 1.3% in March. Business spending on equipment recorded a third straight quarter of double-digit growth in the first quarter.

Inflation rose to 2.3% in April, data from the statistics office showed Tuesday, rapidly increasing from the 1.5% gain in March. Economists expected consumer prices to rise 2.1% from a year earlier.
The inflation boost was driven by rising commodity and energy prices, which had plunged during the same period a year earlier when the pandemic spread across the world. Rising consumer demand and confidence amid an economic recovery are also favorable for prices.

The availability rate for office space in Manhattan rose for the 11th consecutive month in April to a record 16.5%, according to Colliers International. Availability above 10% on the island is considered a renter's market.
Leasing activity in Manhattan decreased 46% from March and was 75% lower from the monthly average in the banner year of 2019, suggesting the market still has a long way to recover.
In a sign of a market potentially on the mend, available sublet space, now representing almost 24% of all available space, fell for the first time since May 2020. When sublet space surpasses 25% of all available space, it is considered a glut.
""It’s difficult to draw any long-term trends with one month of data,"" said Frank Wallach, senior research director in New York at Colliers. ""April began to show early inklings of a possible thaw in the wave of sublet space.""
Despite the glimmer of an uptick, other data showed a market still in the grip of the pandemic.
The average asking rent in Manhattan decreased 0.4% to $72.97 a square foot, the lowest since December 2017. Since the downturn began in March 2020, the average has fallen by 8.2%.

Only one lease was for more than 100,000 square feet, a transaction for 109,000 square feet (10,126 square meters) leased by software company Schrödinger's at 1540 Broadway.

440,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2021 01:40PM ET</span>",Supply chain bottlenecks amid roaring demand slow U.S. manufacturing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in April, restrained by shortages of inputs as rising vaccinations against COVID-19 and massive fiscal stimulus unleashed pent-up demand.
The survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday showed record-long lead times, wide-scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodities prices and difficulties in transporting products across industries. 
The pandemic, now in its second year, has severely disrupted supply chains. The ISM noted that ""companies and suppliers continue to struggle to meet increasing rates of demand due to coronavirus impacts limiting availability of parts and materials."" It cautioned that worker absenteeism, short-term shutdowns due to part shortages and difficulties in filling open positions could limit manufacturing's growth potential.
""Manufacturing is struggling to keep up with roaring demand,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 60.7 last month after surging to 64.7 in March, which was the highest level since December 1983. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to 65 in April.
The White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to all adult Americans have led to a boom in demand, which is pushing against supply constraints. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week the U.S. central bank expected the bottlenecks would be resolved as workers and businesses adapted and ""we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy.""
Inventories at factories and customers are extremely lean, which should keep production humming.
""There is little reason to think conditions are softening,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.  
U.S. stocks rose as upbeat earnings strengthened hopes for sustained profit growth for companies. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.

""CRAZY HIGH"" STEEL PRICES 
All 18 manufacturing industries continued to expand in April, with furniture manufacturers reporting that ""market capacity in most areas is oversold"" and expected that ""demand will continue to strengthen, leading to more significant disruptions."" In the plastics and rubber products sector lead times were the longest in 35 years for some factories.
Manufacturers also complained about steel prices, which makers of fabricated metal products described as ""crazy high."" Imported steel prices have been boosted by tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump to protect domestic industries from what he said was unfair competition.
Electrical equipment, appliances and components manufacturers reported ""it's getting much more difficult to supply production with materials that are made with copper or steel,"" noting ""lots of work on the floor.""
In the automobile industry, a global semiconductor chip shortage has forced cuts in production. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said last week the scarcity of chips slashed production in half in its second quarter. Technology companies are also feeling the heat. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) warned last week that the chip shortage could dent iPads and Mac sales by several billion dollars. 
Demand for goods like motor vehicles and electronics has surged during the pandemic as Americans shunned public transportation and millions worked from home and took classes remotely. Robust consumer spending helped to lift gross domestic product growth at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first quarter.
Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.
The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers rose last month to the highest reading since July 2008, when the economy was in the midst of the Great Recession. That bolsters expectations for higher inflation this year.
""Yet unlike in 2008, demand is far from wavering,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That has put manufacturers in a better position to pass on costs than see their margins squeezed."" 
The survey's forward-looking new orders sub-index dropped to 64.3 after racing to 68.0 in March, which was the highest reading since January 2004. 
Backlogs of uncompleted work increased as did export orders. Manufacturers started drawing down on inventories last month to meet demand. Business warehouses are almost bare.
The survey's manufacturing employment gauge fell to 55.1 after shooting up to 59.6 in March, which was the highest reading since February 2018. The index was well below the 61.5 forecast in the Reuters poll, with the slowdown in hiring probably due to a scarcity of workers. 
Companies across many industries are struggling to find workers, even as employment is 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. The worker shortage could hurt expectations for another month of blockbuster job growth in April. 
According to an early Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 980,000 jobs last month after rising by 916,000 in March. The government is due to publish April's employment report on Friday. 
A separate report on Monday from the Commerce Department showed construction spending gained 0.2% in March after falling 0.6% in February.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone factory activity growth surged to a record high in April, boosted by burgeoning demand and driving a rise in hiring, although supply constraints led to an unprecedented rise in unfulfilled orders, a survey showed.
While a third wave of coronavirus infections in Europe has forced some governments to shutter much of their dominant service industries, factories have largely remained open.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 62.9 in April from March's 62.5, albeit below the initial 63.3 ""flash"" estimate but the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday and that is seen as a good guide to economic health, edged down from March's record high of 63.3 to 63.2. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The euro zone was late out of the gates in terms of its economic rebound but it does seem to be starting. Looking at where we are now the numbers are encouraging,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""It is a foregone conclusion that Q2 will be much stronger than Q1 was.""
The backlogs of work index soared to 61.5 from 60.4, a survey high.
French manufacturing growth eased off a little from March's peak as bottlenecks weighed on the recovery but Italian factory activity grew at its fastest rate on record, sister surveys showed.
German factories have been humming along during the pandemic, almost undisturbed by the related lockdowns, and activity accelerated in Europe's biggest economy early this year on strong demand from the United States and China.
Its latest PMI was only just below March's high at 66.4.
China's factory activity growth slowed and missed forecasts as supply bottlenecks and rising costs weighed on production, a survey showed on Friday, while figures due later on Monday are expected to show an acceleration in U.S. factory growth. (reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=cpurl://apps.cp./Apps/econ-polls?RIC=USPMI%3DECI poll data)
COST PRESSURES
With the cost of raw materials rising at a near record pace, factories were forced to raise their own prices at the sharpest pace since IHS Markit began collecting the data.
""There has been an increase in cost pressures, mainly for manufacturers. Inputs ranging from energy prices to commodity prices are rising and shortages in all sorts of parts of the economy are starting to have an impact on prices,"" Colijn said.

""It does look like that will start to have an impact on goods inflation over the course of this year.""
Inflationary pressures might be welcomed by policymakers at the European Central Bank who have not managed to get inflation anywhere near their goal despite ultra-loose monetary policy.

Monday's figures from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group showed total job ads grew 4.7% in April from March, when they rose 7.8%.
At 196,612, ads were at their highest level since 2008 and up almost 200% on a year earlier when a pandemic lockdown shut many industries.
ANZ senior economist, Catherine Birch, said the strength of ads was welcome given the ending of the government's JobKeeper support programme could see 100,000-150,000 out of work.
""We've also seen almost 160,000 additional people employed over the past two months,"" said Birch. ""Strong labour demand should mean that many, but not all, will be able to find work elsewhere relatively quickly.""
Unemployment has fallen much quicker than policy makers expected to hit 5.6% in March, down from a pandemic peak of 7.5% reached in July last year.

The Reserve Bank of Australia is aiming to drive unemployment down to 4% or even lower in the hope of finally lifting wage growth and inflation after years of tepid gains.

Data from property consultant CoreLogic out on Monday showed national home prices climbed 1.8% in April, after a 2.8% jump in March that had been the largest gain in 32 years. Prices were up 7.8% on last year, and 6.8% in just the three months to April.
Sydney prices raced up 2.4% in April, while Melbourne added 1.3%, Brisbane 1.7% and Perth 0.8%.
The red-hot market has provided a much-needed windfall to consumer wealth and confidence. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the value of homes rose A$258 billion in the December quarter to hit A$7.7 trillion, and that was before the latest surge.
Still, CoreLogic's research director, Tim Lawless, said the pace of gains could slow as inventory levels rise and affordability becomes a bigger constraint.
""With housing prices rising faster than incomes, it's likely price sensitive sectors of the market, such as first home buyers and lower income households, are finding it harder to save for a deposit and transactional costs,"" Lawless said.
The trend toward houses continued with prices in the capital cities up 8.6% in the first four months of the year, twice the gain for apartments. 
Demand for property outside the cities saw regional prices jump a record 1.9% in April, giving an annual rise of 13%.

Buyers have been encouraged by the outlook for borrowing costs, with the Reserve Bank of Australia repeatedly saying rates were likely to remain at a historic low of 0.1% until at least 2024.

New home prices in 100 cities rose 0.23% in April from a month earlier, up marginally from 0.2% in March, according to data from China Index Academy, one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
The strength was mainly contributed by tier-2 and 3 cities in the eastern and southern coastal regions. Monthly new home price growth in 10 major cities including Beijing and Shanghai cooled slightly last month, the data showed, as waves of stringent curbs took some heat out of the market.
""In Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta, as core cities instituted tighter restrictions, the demand is now flowing into nearby tier-3 and 4 cities with a large population base and promising industries,"" said China Index Academy Research Director Cao Jingjing.
Price growth in second-hand homes, a market more opaque and less regulated than the new home sector, quickened to 0.5% in April from previous month, compared with 0.44% in March.
The month saw authorities in a dozen of cities intensifying their campaign to drive speculators out of the property market, taking more targeted steps like capping sales prices set by developers and preventing some real estate agencies from setting excessively high second-hand home prices. 
China's top leaders on Friday also vowed to boost the supply of rental housing and affordable public housing, and prevent speculation in various property markets including school district homes.

Separately, another survey by Chinese property data provider Zhuge House Hunter showed growth in China's average home rental prices quickened in April at the fastest pace since February 2020, driven by rising demand in first-tier cities as the country's economy steadily recovered from the coronavirus shock last year.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2021 11:45AM ET</span>",Stimulus checks boost U.S. consumer spending; inflation warming up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rebounded in March amid a surge in income as households received additional COVID-19 pandemic relief money from the government, building a strong foundation for a further acceleration in consumption in the second quarter.
Other data on Friday showed labor costs jumped by the most in 14 years in the first quarter, driven by a pick-up in wage growth as companies competed for workers to boost production. The White House's massive $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus and rapidly improving public health are unleashing pent-up demand.
""While we aren't completely out of the woods yet, today's report shows the beginning of an economic rebound,"" said Brendan Coughlin, head of consumer banking at Citizens in Boston. ""Assuming no setback in the continued rollout of the vaccines, U.S. consumers are well-positioned in the second half of the year to stimulate strong economic growth across the country.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 4.2% last month after falling 1.0% in February, the Commerce Department said. The increase was broadly in line with economists' expectations.
The data was included in Thursday's gross domestic product report for the first quarter, which showed growth shooting up at a 6.4% annualized rate in the first three months of the year after rising at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending powered ahead at a 10.7% rate last quarter.
Most Americans in the middle- and low-income brackets received one-time $1,400 stimulus checks last month which were part of the pandemic rescue package approved in March. That boosted personal income 21.1% after a drop of 7.0% in February. 
A chunk of the cash was stashed away, with the saving rate soaring to 27.6% from 13.9% in February. Households have amassed at least $2.2 trillion in excess savings, which could provide a powerful tailwind for consumer spending this year and beyond.
The government's generosity and expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination program to include all American adults is lifting consumer spirits, with a measure of household sentiment rising to a 13-month high in April.
Wages are also increasing, which should to help to underpin spending when stimulus boost fades.
In a separate report on Friday, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, jumped 0.9% in the first quarter. That was the largest rise since the second quarter of 2007.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Last quarter's increase was driven by a 1.0% rise in wages, also the biggest gain in 14 years.
Wages in the accommodation and food services industry, hardest hit by the pandemic, soared 1.7%.
Despite employment being 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, businesses are struggling to find qualified workers as they rush to meet the robust domestic demand.
U.S. stocks were lower after a recent rally. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
INFLATION RISING
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the worker shortage saying ""one big factor would be schools aren't open yet, so there's still people who are at home taking care of their children, and would like to be back in the workforce, but can't be yet."" 
Economists agree and expect the rising wages to contribute to higher inflation this year. 
The strengthening demand and the dropping of last year's weak readings from the calculation lifted inflation last month. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy component increased 0.4% after edging up 0.1% in February. In the 12 months through March, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.8%, the most since February 2020. 
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target, which is a flexible average. 
Powell reiterated on Wednesday that he expected higher inflation will transitory. But some economists have doubts.
""While labor costs are hardly getting out of hand, there is clearly more wage pressure in the economy at present than the early stages of the past cycle,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""Stronger labor cost growth even before the economy hits full employment is a reason to think that even after the reopening-fueled pop this year, inflation is likely to settle above the anemic rate of the past cycle.""
Households last month spent more on motor vehicles and recreational. They also visited restaurants. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rebounded 3.6% last month after falling 1.2% in February. The rebound in the so-called real consumer spending sets consumption on a higher growth trajectory heading into the second quarter.

Most economists expect double-digit growth this quarter, which would position the economy to achieve growth of at least 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, its worst performance in 74 years.

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, jumped 0.9% last quarter after gaining 0.7% in the October-December quarter. That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.6% from 2.5% in the fourth quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI rising 0.7% in the first quarter.
Wages and salaries shot up 1.0% after advancing 0.8% in the fourth quarter. They were up 2.7% year-on-year. Economists expect wages will increase further in the second quarter as companies compete for scarce workers. 
Despite employment being 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020, businesses are struggling to find suitable workers as they rush to meet robust domestic demand.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro contracted 0.6% quarter-on-quarter for a 1.8% year-on-year fall.
This put the single currency area in a technical recession after a 0.7% quarterly GDP fall in the last quarter of 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.8% quarterly and a 2.0% annual decline. 
The euro zone's first quarter contraction was mainly caused by a 1.7% quarterly slump in its biggest economy Germany, though mitigated by 0.4% quarterly growth in second biggest France.
Separately, Eurostat estimated euro zone consumer prices rose 0.6% month-on-month in April for a 1.6% year-on-year gain, as expected by economists polled by Reuters. 
The rise was mainly caused by a 10.3% year-on-year surge in energy prices, which offset the 0.4% year-on-year fall in the costs of unprocessed food.
Without these two most volatile components, or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices rose 0.5% month-on-month for a 0.8% year-on-year increase, a deceleration from the 1.0% year-on-year core inflation rate the month before.
The core inflation drop reinforces calls by European Central Bank doves to maintain the stimulus to the economy and hold off on tapering the pandemic bond purchases until the growth rebound fully materialises.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's economy grew at its fastest pace in more than a decade in the first three months of 2021 as the ""work from home"" boom sparked strong global demand for the island's hi-tech exports. Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 8.16% in January-March from a year earlier, preliminary data from the statistics agency showed on Friday, up from the fourth quarter's 5.09% rise. The reading was well above the 6.1% increase forecast in a Reuters poll and was the fastest pace since growth of 11.54% in the third quarter of 2010.
Compared with the fourth quarter, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of growth was 12.93% in the first quarter. The government attributed the strong growth to surging demand for electronics, driven by new technologies such as 5G and by people working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Total exports rose 24.58% in the first quarter year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms, while exports of electronics components rose 28.37% and those of communication and audio-visual products leapt 29.67%, the agency said.
""Demand for 5G and high-performance computing continues to increase, and orders for communications and electronic products are booming,"" it added.
Statistics official Wu Pei-hsuan said exports and investment numbers were far better than expected, saying it wasn't only chip firms expanding their production but sectors like petrochemicals. too.
Domestic consumption also performed well, Wu added.
Revised GDP figures, including growth estimates for the full year, will be released later in May.
Capital Economics increased its growth forecast for this year to 8% from the previous 5% after the data was published. The tech-powerhouse island, home to the world's largest contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), has benefited from global demand for smartphones, tablets and computers from people forced to study and work from home in large parts of the world.

LONDON (Reuters) -British house prices jumped by 2.1% in April, their biggest monthly rise in more than 17 years, after finance minister Rishi Sunak unexpectedly extended a tax break on property sales, mortgage lender Nationwide said on Friday.
House prices are now 7.1% above their level last April, a growth rate which is just shy of the six-year high of 7.3% recorded in December, as COVID-19 lockdowns and increased home-working continue to boost demand for more spacious housing.
""Just as expectations of the end of the stamp duty holiday led to a slowdown in house price growth in March, so the extension of the stamp duty holiday in the Budget prompted a reacceleration in April,"" Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said.
The tax break had been due to expire at the end of March. But the first 500,000 pounds ($697,050) of any property purchase in England or Northern Ireland will now remain exempt from stamp duty land tax until the end of June, and there will be a 250,000 pound tax-free allowance until the end of September.
Sunak introduced the tax break in July last year, in a bid to kick-start the housing market after a collapse in home sales during the initial months of the pandemic.
Demand surged when restrictions eased. Many buyers sought bigger homes further away from city centres, as they began to work from home rather than commute into an office.
The most recent data from the Office for National Statistics, as opposed to Nationwide numbers, shows that house prices in February were 8.4% above their level a year earlier, the largest annual rise since 2014.
Nationwide said there was scope for house prices to rise further in the coming months due to a fairly fixed supply of housing and a continued desire to move as a result of the pandemic, which reduced demand for small city-centre homes.
But Gardner said activity could slow later this year, perhaps sharply, if unemployment increased as expected.
Howard Archer, economist at consultants EY ITEM Club, forecast that annual price growth would tail off towards the end of the year and that prices could fall on a quarterly basis.

""We believe the strength of the housing market is excessive relative to the economic fundamentals, and the level of prices increases will ultimately prove unsustainable,"" he said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Ishwinder Kaur and her husband spent more than two years looking to buy their first home in Singapore, hoping property prices would dip during the hunt.
The couple finally bought their apartment in December after prices rose in all but one quarter last year, even as the city state posted its worst recession during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""We got really worried because we saw that people were snapping up homes left, right and centre,"" said Kaur. 
House prices rose again in the first quarter, with the private home market up 3.3%, its steepest rise in nearly three years, fueling expectations the government is likely to intervene soon to calm the market. 
(Graphic: Singapore home prices rising - https://graphics.reuters.com/SINGAPORE-PROPERTY/SINGAPORE-PROPERTY/qzjvqzrnopx/Singapore%20private%20home%20prices%202021.JPG)
Driven by low interest rates, confidence in property's long-term safety and a fear of missing out, the boom is putting buyers increasingly at odds with the government, which has been warning that purchasers should exercise caution.
Authorities in Singapore, where real estate is a safe haven investment for wealthy foreigners, keep close tabs on property prices to ensure housing remains affordable for locals and stays in step with economic fundamentals.
They began advising prudence late last year, with Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam warning again in April that home buyers should exercise caution given the risk of rising interest rates. Instead, some buyers are trying to get ahead of any intervention, further driving up sales. 
""Considering that only property value seems to be growing steadily, and extra stamp duties may kick in soon to cool the market, it is better to invest in a new house at this time,"" said sales engineer Faye Zhou, who is looking for a condominium.
Government tools to cool the market include boosting stamp duties on foreign buyers and investors with multiple homes, or increasing the proportion of downpayments. It can also increase land supply through tenders.
Private home prices fell 11.6% from a 2013 peak over a span of 15 quarters after the government took steps to curb a housing market boom as Singapore emerged from the global financial crisis.
The government last tightened curbs in 2018 after prices rose about 9% over a year and analysts expect it to act again as the city-state's economic recovery from the pandemic is uneven and near-term wage growth remains muted.
Foreign demand is also returning, according to property consultants OrangeTee, helping boost sales of luxury homes to their highest since the third quarter of 2017.
Total transactions in the first quarter nearly doubled from a year ago, touching their highest in at least two years.
The housing loan booking at DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY), Singapore's biggest bank, has been at record levels. 
""Some of it is because of people's view that you might see some cooling measures. So people are trying to get ahead of that,"" CEO Piyush Gupta said in the bank's results call with reporters.
INVENTORY SQUEEZE
Further out, supply is set to tighten in both the private and public housing markets due to pandemic-driven delays in construction.
The inventory of uncompleted homes with developers is dwindling and had fallen by 40% as of the first quarter compared with two years ago.
Developers will likely seek to acquire land to replenish their inventories, either sites from the government or existing apartments blocks that can redeveloped. Analysts expect intense competition for land, which may, in turn fuel further price rises. 
Property in land-scarce Singapore has long attracted the super-rich from around Asia, with political uncertainty in rival Hong Kong helping boost that appeal.
And even if prices fall in the near-term from recent highs, buyers are confident they will not stay low forever. 

""Property prices in Singapore will certainly still grow steadily in the long term ... there's limited land but more people are coming into Singapore,"" said Sky Chen, a 30-year-old architect who bought his apartment in November.

The country's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.1 in April from 51.9 in March, data from the national Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday.
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis but was below the 51.7 expected in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""Some surveyed companies report that problems such as chip shortages, problems in international logistics, a shortage of containers, and rising freight rates are still severe,"" NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement accompanying the official PMI.
That contrasted with a private-sector survey, also released on Friday, which showed factory activity in April expanded at the fastest pace in four months although businesses in that release also reported a sharp surge in input costs.
""With the economy already above its pre-virus trend and the policy stance less supportive, growth momentum will wane this year,"" analysts from Capital Economics said in a note on the PMI.
China's economic recovery quickened sharply in the first quarter of the year with record growth of 18.3%, shaking off the hit from last year's COVID-19-induced slump. Analysts now expect the world's second-largest economy to grow 8.6% in 2021.
The robust economic recovery has outpaced rebounds seen in manufacturing competitors such as India, which are still struggling to contain new waves of coronavirus outbreaks.
Policymakers in Beijing have signalled they are keen to avoid sudden policy changes that could derail the recovery.
""We expect that an export demand recovery will help factory orders and that the May holiday will help the services sector,"" said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, in a note, referring to China's labour day vacation due to start on Saturday.
Overseas demand should also pick up as COVID-19 is brought under control in major markets like the United States and Europe, she said, but chip shortages could continue for several quarters and push up prices of electronic goods.
From delayed car deliveries to a supply shortfall in home appliances, businesses and consumers across the globe are facing the brunt of an unprecedented shortage in semiconductor microchips, exacerbated by sanctions against Chinese tech companies.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed businesses again laid off workers in April after increasing hiring the month before for the first time in nearly a year. A sub-index for employment slipped to 49.6 from 50.1 in March.
A gauge for new export orders stood at 50.4 in April, slipping from 51.2 a month earlier.
Riding the broader economic recovery, surging demand for raw materials fuelled Chinese industrial firms' robust profit growth in March as profits upstream outperformed those in downstream sectors.

A sub-index for raw material costs in the official PMI stood at 66.9 in April, easing from March's 69.4 but maintaining a rapid clip.
In the services sector, activity expanded for the 14th straight month, but at a slower pace, dragged down by a sub-index for construction activity.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy grew 0.4% in the first three months of the year from the fourth quarter, when it had shrunk 1.4%, the INSEE stats agency said.
That compared with an average forecast of 0.1% growth in a Reuters poll of 33 economists' expectations, which ranged from 1.0% to -1.3%.
The government progressively tightened curbs during the first quarter and France entered a third national lockdown at the end of March as infections spiked and pressure on hospitals increased.
Consumer spending grew 0.3% in the quarter despite the measures, recovering from a 5.7% slump in the fourth quarter, when France faced a month-long national lockdown in November.
Business investment proved particularly strong, gaining 2.2% in the quarter, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter.
While domestic demand added 0.9% percentage points to the growth rate, a slump in exports meant that foreign trade represented a 0.4% drag, INSEE said.
Under pressure from business and a weary public, President Emmanuel Macron announced a four-phase plan on Wednesday to wind down the current lockdown.
In particular, France will start relaxing a nightly curfew and allow cafes, bars and restaurants to offer outside service from May 19.

The lockdown has had less impact than in the past on the economy, with business and consumer sentiment surveys largely holding up and even improving in the industrial sector.

Investing.com – China’s manufacturing activity accelerated at a slower-than-expected pace in April, indicating the economy continues to recover but at a slower pace on the back of strong demand.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day said that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for April was 51.1, lower than both the 51.7 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and March’s 51.9 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 54.9, also below its March reading of 56.3. However, both remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
In the private sector, the Caixin manufacturing PMI for April was 51.9, above the 50.8 in forecasts prepare by Investing.com and March’s 50.6 reading. Investors now await the Caixin services PMI, due in the following week.
The figures showed “China’s economy continued to recover steadily,"" but “some surveyed companies said problems such as chip shortages, poor international logistics, shortages of containers, and rising freight rates are still serious,” NBS economist Zhao Qinghe said in a note.
The note added that a slowdown in manufacturing supply and demand, as well as rising cost pressures, also remain as challenges.
Meanwhile, stronger consumer confidence is boosting services industries as the country lifted travel restrictions earlier in the year.
On the construction side, however, the outlook is more complicated as the government eased debt sales to finance infrastructure projects. It also approved fewer fixed-asset projects which dropped sharply in the first quarter compared with 2020. The real estate market is also facing stricter financing rules.
The “services PMI slowed more than manufacturing PMI due to deleveraging reform in the real estate sector, and this will continue,” Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank NV in Hong Kong, told Bloomberg.
However, she projected a rebound due to a five-day holiday starting Saturday.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japanese industrial production rose 2.2% month-on-month in March, higher than the 2% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 1.3% contraction.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51.9 in April from an 11-month low of 50.6 in March, beating analyst expectations for a smaller uptick to 50.8. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
That contrasted with China's official PMI on Friday, which showed factory activity expanding at a slower-than-expected pace in April.
Both output and new orders increased at the fastest pace this year, the survey showed, while overseas demand improved. Manufacturers also increased their staffing levels for the first time in five months.
But the private survey showed factories reported a sharp increase in input costs, which surged at their fastest clip since 2017. Some pressure was passed onto customers as output prices continued to rise, although at a slower pace than the month before.
""Raw material prices kept pushing up manufacturers' costs. The prices of industrial metals — especially steel — and chemical raw materials continued to surge,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.
""Rising raw material prices and imported inflation are expected to limit policy choices and become a major obstacle to the sustained economic recovery.""
Earlier in April, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stressed the need to strengthen market regulation of raw materials to ease the cost pressure on enterprises amid rising global commodities prices, China's official Xinhua news agency reported. 
China's factory gate prices rose 4.4% in annual terms last month, at their fastest pace since July 2018. April data will be released on May 11.
Firms' outlook for the year ahead edged down but remained highly optimistic due to hopes of an end to the pandemic and the release of more demand, the survey showed.
The Caixin survey focuses on small, private and export-oriented firms while the official survey, also released on Friday, typically polls large and state-owned manufacturers.
Beijing has successfully curbed the domestic transmission of the COVID-19 virus, leading to quarantine restrictions and testing requirements being scaled back as life returns to normal.
Economic growth quickened sharply in the first quarter to a record 18.3%, driven by stronger demand at home and abroad and supported by a low comparison base the previous year due to COVID-19 disruptions.

China has set an annual economic growth target at above 6% this year, which is lower than the analyst consensus but makes allowances for uncertainties. Premier Li Keqiang has warned against any sharp turn in policymaking.

461,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 09:45PM ET</span>",Japan's March factory output rebounds as car production jumps,"By Daniel Leussink and Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output posted a surprise increase in March, as a jump in car production helped keep an economic recovery from last year's deep coronavirus slump on track.
The output rise will likely ease worries about the impact the health crisis is having on the manufacturing sector in the world's third-largest economy, which is recovering thanks to strong overseas demand, especially from China.
Separate data showed the jobless rate fell from the previous month in a sign of strength in employment conditions, while Tokyo consumer prices fell unexpectedly in April due to cuts in mobile phone fees by major carriers.
Government data released on Friday showed factory output grew 2.2% from the previous month in March, lifted by a sharp jump in car production and higher output of organic and inorganic chemicals.
The output rise, a reversal from the previous month's 1.3% decline, was much better than a 2.0% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
""The worry is whether this trend can continue,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""It is necessary to pay attention to whether reduced demand is putting downward pressure on future output as a state of emergency has been declared in Tokyo and Osaka.""
The data showed manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to rise another 8.4% in April, followed by a 4.3% decrease in May.
Factory output had dropped in February as weakening production across sectors such as cars and electrical machinery outweighed better demand for tech-making equipment that has been a major output driver.
Japan's economy is expected to take a hit from a third state of emergency for Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures called by the government last week in response to a resurgence of COVID-19 infections.
The measures, which are scheduled to last until May 11, are expected to especially hurt the services sector as households are seen cutting down on travel, leisure and dining out activities, likely signalling a domestic demand slowdown.
DIVERGENCE
Japan's factory activity expanded in April at the fastest pace since early 2018, a separate private sector survey showed on Friday, underlining the tailwind manufacturers have been getting from strong global demand.
The country's economy has emerged from last year's deep recession on strong exports, though a slow vaccine rollout and repeated emergency measures called in response to an infection resurgence have hurt consumption.
A growing divergence between manufacturers profiting from a global economic recovery and service sector firms facing tepid consumption at home is posing a challenge for policymakers.
""The divergence will likely continue this year,"" said Sera. ""At its earliest, it may take until the middle of next year for the economy to recover to pre-coronavirus levels.""
Other official data out on Friday showed the country's seasonally adjusted jobless rate fell to 2.6% in March, beating the median estimate of 2.9%.
The labour ministry said the jobs-to-applicants ratio was 1.10 in March, up from 1.09 in the previous month and also above a Reuters poll forecast of 1.09.

Government data on Friday also showed Tokyo's core consumer price index, which excludes fresh food, dropped 0.2% in April due to the mobile phone fee cuts, making the central bank's 2% inflation target increasingly out of reach.

The activity expansion highlights the tailwind manufacturers have been getting from strong external demand, particularly from China, which forms the basis for keeping intact the economic recovery from last year's steep coronavirus drop.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 53.6 in April, its most robust expansion since February 2018.
That was up from a flash reading of 53.3 and the previous month's final of 52.7. It meant manufacturing activity came in above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the third straight month.
The PMI survey showed output also grew at its fastest pace since February 2018, while the taking on of new graduates at the start of the country's fiscal year in April and higher capacity needs due to increased orders boosted the rate of job creation.
Manufacturers saw input prices rising for an 11th month on high demand for intermediate goods used for producing cars and electronics, with the rate of input cost inflation coming in at its fastest since late 2018.
Businesses reported a positive medium-term activity outlook, said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. 
It was too early to say exactly what impact a third state of emergency for Tokyo and other prefectures declared last week to contain the pandemic would have on manufacturers in the months ahead.
The survey showed firms' output expectations for the year ahead were in line with an IHS Markit forecast for 7.7% industrial production growth this year, Bhatti said.
""This does not fully recover the output lost to the pandemic in 2020,"" he said.

""Further disruption to the manufacturing sector cannot be ruled out as COVID-19 restrictions are reintroduced as infections rise once again.""

463,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",U.S. 1Q GDP Growth Quickens; Jobless Claims Inch Down to New Low,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. economy strengthened in the first quarter of 2021, as Covid-19-related lockdowns started to ease, allowing a partial recovery to take hold. 
Government data released on Thursday showed gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 6.4% in the first quarter, up from 4.3% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and faster than consensus forecasts of a 6.1% rate.
The acceleration was due in large measure to the $1.9 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress earlier in the year that distributed a new round of stimulus checks to households. Real consumer spending grew at an annualized result of 10.7% as a result.
More up-to-date checks on the state of the economy also showed steady progress, with initial claims for jobless benefits inching down to a new post-pandemic low of 553,000 last week. However, the previous week's number was revised up by nearly 20,000 to 566,000. Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones, were effectively flat at 3.660 million.
The dollar and 10-Year Treasury yields ticked down on the news, as the market zeroed in on a below-forecast reading for a data series that is the Federal Reserve's favored metric for inflation. Core personal consumer expenditures, which track changes in consumer spending patterns more quickly than the official consumer price inflation index, rose at an annual rate of only 2.3% in the quarter, slightly below the 2.4% consensus. 
On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had batted away concerns that loose monetary policy and a strong economic rebound could soon lead to runaway inflation, saying that the current rise in prices and the factors behind it were ""transitory"".
Powell stressed again at his press conference that the economy ""is still some way"" from the Fed's goal of full employment, as he again shunned invitations to speculate on when the central bank will start to tighten its policy. 
That focus on the labor market was reflected in Labor Department figures that showed a total of over 16 million people still claiming unemployment-related benefits under various state and federal programs. However, the pattern of progress was repeated again last week, with the number of total claimants dropping by nearly 846,000.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Euro zone economic sentiment surged in April as vaccination campaigns against the coronavirus gathered speed, with sharp gains across all sectors of the economy that economists said marked the end of the pandemic-induced recession.
The European Commission's monthly sentiment survey for the 19 countries sharing the euro on Thursday showed optimism rising to 110.3 points in April from 100.9 in March, beating consensus estimates in a Reuters poll of a 102.2 reading.
""The services sector now also in expansion mode. We can now declare the Covid-19 recession over. Inflation expectations also continue to increase,"" ING bank economist Peter Vanden Houte wrote in a note to clients.
The mood became much more upbeat in industry, rising to 10.7 points from 2.1 in March, far exceeding consensus expectations of an increase to 4.0. In services, the euro zone's biggest sector responsible for more than two thirds of gross domestic product, the reading went up to 2.1 points from -9.6 in March, also far above expectations.
Consumer optimism rose to -8.1 from -10.8, in line with an initial estimate published last week, and in retail trade to -3.1 from -12.2. 
The optimism translated into manufacturing industry's selling price expectations rising to 24.1 points in April from 17.5 in March, coming very close to the highest reading since 2000, which was 25.5 points in March 2011.
Consumers also began to expect higher inflation over the next 12 months, with the reading going up to 19.6 in April from 18.6 in March, moving above the average reading since 2000.
""The big question is how temporary these price increases will be,"" Vanden Houte said.
""Will they disappear once some of the supply chains problems are resolved? With strong demand to be expected in the second half of the year and a further inventory build-up in the offing, we doubt that price tensions will disappear quickly,"" he said.

He said that while it was too early to expect a price-wage spiral, if there is a strong recovery in the coming months as suggested by the April sentiment data, the European Central Bank may become less inclined to keep up its bond buying scheme.
""The chances of the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme being lengthened after March 2022 are getting slimmer by the day and the central bank could even suggest that it will not fully spend the current envelope,"" he said.

A European Commission sentiment index increased to 110.3, exceeding all estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The highest reading since 2018 reflects improvements across all parts of the economy and the European Union’s six largest members.
The data add to signs that the region is starting to recover from the pandemic even as infection rates in some countries remain high. Immunizations have accelerated after early stumbles, allowing governments to plot an exit from restrictions that almost certainly tipped the bloc into a double-dip recession in the first three months of the year.
The German government this week raised its growth forecast for the year to 3.5% and expressed confidence that consumer spending will take off once the pandemic is under control. Manufacturing has also held up well, though the sector is now facing supply shortages that are threatening to hold back the recovery.
Industrial confidence hit a record high in April, with production expectations reaching unprecedented levels while stocks were scarcer than ever. The mood in services improved for a second consecutive month, driven by optimism about future demand.
Consumers assessed both the general economic situation and their personal conditions as more positive. Employment plans rose in all surveyed business areas.
A separate report on Thursday showed unemployment in Germany unexpectedly increased this month after nearly six months of lockdowns -- despite generous government subsidies enabling businesses to retain workers.
The European Central Bank has repeatedly pointed to downside risks for the economy in the short term, arguing that prospects will improve in the second half.
By then, countries are set to see the first disbursements from the EU’s 800 billion-euro ($969 billion) recovery fund. Plans for how to use the money are being submitted to the European Commission this week.

LONDON (Reuters) -British employees returned to work and shoppers stepped up spending on clothes and furniture after lockdown restrictions eased across most of the country earlier this month, official figures showed on Thursday.
The proportion of employees on furlough between April 5 and April 18 dropped to 13%, down from 17% in the previous two-week period, according to a survey of businesses conducted by the Office for National Statistics.
Shops selling 'non-essential' goods reopened in England and Wales on April 12, and English pubs and restaurants were able to serve customers outdoors. COVID restrictions are also easing this month in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The ONS said spending on what it calls 'delayable' goods such as clothes and furniture rose to 10% above pre-pandemic levels in the week to April 22, up by 21 percentage points from the week before when shops began to reopen.
Overall spending on credit and debit cards was now 98% of its level in February 2020, up from 91% the week before, based on high-value CHAPS payments data from card processors collected by the Bank of England, the ONS said.
However dining and drinking outdoors - during a period of chilly weather for the time of year - has been less appealing.

After a rush of demand on the first day that pubs and restaurants reopened, the level of reservations on April 24 was 62% of its level on the same Saturday two years earlier, similar to the 60% seen a week before.
Pubs and restaurants in England are expected to be allowed to resume indoor service, subject to social distancing requirements, on May 17.

Twenty percent of respondents in the poll by Kantar Public said they had increased their savings because of restrictions on travel, shopping and socialising, while 21% said their savings had fallen and 41% said they had not changed.
Older people were more likely than younger ones to have saved money.
Of those people who did save money as a result of the lockdowns, only 3% intended to spend it all by the end of the year. Some 9% said they would spend most of it and 7% said they would spend half of it.
The biggest share, 38%, said they would spend some of their new savings while 18% said they would spend none at all.
The Bank of England has said the speed with which people spend lockdown savings will be a key variable for determining how fast the economy recovers after it slumped by nearly 10% last year.
The poll also found that 62% of respondents said their personal income had not been impacted by coronavirus, up from 56% in March and 49% in January.

Kantar said it interviewed 1,115 people between April 22 and April 26.

Investing.com – The Federal Reserve left rates unchanged Wednesday, and appears to be in no rush to rein in its accommodative stance even as vaccine rollouts and fiscal stimulus have bolstered the recovery.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25% and maintained its monthly pace of bond buying at $120 billion.
""Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement,"" the Fed said in a statement.
Despite the improving economic backdrop and faster pace of reopening, the pandemic continues to weigh on the outlook, according to the Fed. ""The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on the economy, and risks to the economic outlook remain.""
In the press conference that followed the policy statement, Fed chairman Jerome Powell continued to signal that the current stand on policy will remain steady for some time.   
""We continue to expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current zero to one quarter percent target range for the federal funds rate until labour market conditions have reached levels consistent with the committee's assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2%, and is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time.""
Still, market participants remain wary of an unexpected shift in the Fed's policy. Incoming economic data continue to point to a robust recovery as inflation steps up pace.
The 10-year inflation ""breakevens,” a key measure of inflation expectations over the next decade, topped 2.4% on Tuesday, the highest level since April 2013. The PCE index, the Fed's preferred inflation measures, was at 1.6% for February.
The central bank has not turned a blind eye to the increasing pace of inflation, but continues to suggest the post-reopening boom in inflation will be short-lived, or transitory. ""Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors,"" the Fed said in a statement.
""[W]e are likely to see some upward pressure on prices and but those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process and one-time price increases as the economy reopens,"" Powell said. ""It is not likely to lead to persistently higher year over year inflation into the future,"" he added. 
On the labor market, the Fed chief said the economy is a ""long way from full employment"" as unemployment remains above pre-pandemic levels. ""We've got a long ways to go,"" Powell added."
469,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2021 09:45AM ET</span>","U.S. auto sales to more than double in April: J.D. Power, LMC Automotive","(Reuters) - U.S. auto retail sales for April are expected to be the highest ever recorded for the month, helped by strong consumer demand and tighter inventories at dealerships, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Wednesday.
Retail sales for new vehicles in April are forecast to reach 1.3 million units, up 110.6% compared with last year, said the statement.
Total auto sales for April, including retail and non-retail, are projected to reach 1.5 million units, a 107.1% increase compared to the same period in 2020.
""With the sales pace exceeding the rate at which vehicles are being produced, compounded by significant production disruption due to microchip shortages, there is a growing risk to the industry's ability to sustain the current sales pace in the coming months,"" said Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.
Average transaction prices are expected to rise 6.8% to $37,572, the highest ever for April, while the average incentive spending per unit is expected to fall to $3,191 from $4,953 last year.
King said low inventories ""have enabled manufacturers and retailers to reduce discounts"", and consumers were willing to buy vehicles closer to the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) and more expensive vehicles.

The total seasonally adjusted annualized rate for the month will be 18.1 million vehicles, while it was 16.4 million units in 2019, the report said.

The trimmed mean core inflation gauge advanced 0.3% from the final three months of last year, compared with economists’ estimates of a 0.5% gain, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. Trimmed mean rose 1.1% in the first quarter from a year earlier versus an estimated 1.2% increase.
“The introduction, continuation and conclusion of a number of government schemes remained a factor in the March quarter,” said Michelle Marquardt, head of Prices Statistics at the ABS. “The fall in new dwelling prices was due to the impact of the Federal Government’s HomeBuilder grant and similar grants by the Western Australian and Tasmanian state governments.”
The Australian dollar fell 0.4% after the release to trade at 77.29 U.S. cents at 11:35 a.m. in Sydney.
The headline consumer price index advanced 0.6% from the final three months of last year, compared with economists’ estimates of a 0.9% gain. It increased 1.1% from a year earlier versus an estimated 1.4% increase.
Australian prices have been hit by cross-currents caused by fallout from Covid-19. The Reserve Bank of Australia adjusted its inflation framework to allow the economy to run a little hotter, saying it won’t raise interest rates until consumer prices are actually -- not forecast to be -- sustainably within its 2-3% target.
Governor Philip Lowe says achieving that goal will require wage gains of more than 3% for an extended period. That’s likely to take time given wages are currently around record lows. The RBA doesn’t expect to raise rates until 2024 at the earliest.

471,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 02:16PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence soars to 14-month high; house prices accelerate,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence jumped to a 14-month high in April as increased vaccinations against COVID-19 and additional fiscal stimulus allowed for more services businesses to reopen, boosting demand and hiring by companies.
The upbeat survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday, which also showed a strong increase in vacation plans, suggested the economy continued to power ahead early in the second quarter after what appears to have been robust growth in the first three months of the year, believed by many economists to have been the second strongest since 2003. Growth this year is expected to be the best in nearly four decades.
""Consumers are seeing the light at the end of the COVID tunnel,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""Led by strong spending as households return to eating out, traveling and visiting stores, the economy should surge ahead starting the second quarter and likely carrying into 2022."" 
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index raced to a reading of 121.7 this month. That was the highest level since February 2020, just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and followed a reading of 109.0 in March. It was the fourth straight monthly increase in the index.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would increase to a reading of 113.0 in April.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, soared to a reading of 139.6 from 110.1 last month. But the expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions, ticked up to 109.8 from 108.3 in March.
The United States has expanded vaccination eligibility to American adults, and more than half that population has had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over a third of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated. 
Easing anxiety about the virus and the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package have allowed for greater economic re-engagement. Retail sales surged to a record high in March and employers hired the most workers in seven months. Businesses are also investing in equipment to boost production. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
BULLISH LABOR MARKET VIEWS
The Conference Board survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, vaulted to a reading of 24.7 - the largest in 13 months and up from 8 in March. 
That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's closely watched employment report, and suggested another month of blockbuster job gains in April. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has dropped to a 13-month low. 
Federal Reserve officials meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday are likely to acknowledge the improving economic climate, but the U.S. central bank is expected to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance as employment remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
The government's snapshot of first-quarter GDP on Thursday will likely show the economy grew at a 6.1% annualized rate during the first three months of the year, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would be the second-fastest growth pace since the third quarter of 2003 and would follow a 4.3% rate of expansion in the final three months of 2020 and a 33.4% surge in the third quarter of last year.
The Conference Board survey showed the share of consumers expecting an increase in income over the next six months rose to 17.9% from 15.4% in March. The proportion anticipating a drop fell to 10.9% from 12.6% last month. It also showed more Americans planned to go on vacation over the next six months, with that share rising to 43.3% from 34.0% back in February when households were canvassed on the subject. 
Many intended to fly to their destinations, mostly in the United States. This could provide a powerful boost to the services industry, which was disproportionately impacted by the pandemic. Consumers also planned to buy big-ticket items like cars and houses, though fewer intended to purchase major appliances relative to March. 
Strong house-buying intentions suggest demand for homes could remain supported and continue to drive up prices as supply remains tight. The housing market is being powered by demand for more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. Demographics also point to a strong housing market, with people between the ages of 26 and 34 accounting for about 12.5% of the U.S. population. 
""This suggests a noticeable tailwind for demand as the average first-time home buyer is in their early 30s,"" said Brady Seitz, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index jumped 12% in February from a year ago, the fastest in 15 years, after rising 11.2% in January.

Accelerating house price inflation was corroborated by a third report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency house price index shot up a record 12.2% on a year-on-year basis in February after increasing 12.1% in January.

Latin America's second largest economy posted a $2.906 billion trade deficit last month when adjusted for seasonal swings. The deficit was $3.004 billion in non-seasonally adjusted terms.
""The weak performance of auto exports in February-March reflects to some extent supply chain disruptions caused by gas supply restrictions in parts of the U.S. and Mexico and scarcity of semiconductors,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a note.
Automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp have cut production this year due to a global semiconductor chip shortage.
Manufacturing exports, which account for roughly 30% of Mexico's gross domestic product, jumped by 9.9% in March versus a year earlier and increased by 2.2% during the first three months of the year on an annual basis, according to INEGI data.
That was weighed down in March by a 5.2% drop in auto exports, which account for roughly a third of all manufacturing shipments, and a 4.8% drop in January to March shipments of cars.
The reactivation of Mexico's manufacturing sector ""will be slower than previously expected due to the problem with a chip"" shortage in the automotive sector, economist Jose Luis De la Cruz said.

He added, though, that a low base of comparison in April and May 2020 should boost figures over the next couple of months.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile expects the soaring price of its main export copper to boost growth and underwrite the nearly $16 billion in stimulus the country expects to have handed out to its citizens during the coronavirus pandemic.
Finance Minister Rodrigo Cerda told lawmakers during a presentation of the government's quarterly public finance report that Chile expects the copper price to average $3.99 per pound in 2021, a big increase over its January prediction of $3.35. 
Sky-rocketing copper prices, combined with a major bump in economic activity expected as a result of its fast-paced vaccination drive could see Chile's gross domestic product jump 6% in 2021, up from a previous estimate of 5%, Cerda said.
The world's biggest copper producer reaps an additional $60 million in taxes and royalties for every penny the copper price rises, based on official estimates.
The minister said Chile could also thank copper revenues for helping to stabilize debt in 2021 despite rising expenditures. 
""The price of copper, now much higher, gives us more income, and permits us, of course, to more rapidly contain debt levels,"" Cerda said in the presentation.
Chile's copper output has continued without much disruption during much of the pandemic as most of its large mining companies adjusted early, stepping up sanitary measures and working with limited staff.
The country is also far ahead of regional neighbors in its vaccination drive, an advantage it hopes will prime the economy for a major rebound in the second half of 2021, Cerda said. 
Domestic demand is expected to grow 10.7% in 2021, up from a previous estimate of 8.8%, amid expectations that the pandemic will soon subside as more Chileans are innoculated.
Health ministry statistics show that more than half of a target population of 15 million Chileans has been vaccinated.

The finance report also noted that consumer prices would rise 3.4%, up slightly from a prior forecast of 3.0%.

474,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",Biden raises minimum wage for federal contractors to $15/hour,"By Nandita Bose and Jarrett Renshaw
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Tuesday will continue his push for a national $15 minimum wage with an executive order that raises pay to at least that level for hundreds of thousands of federal contract workers, according to senior White House officials.
The move will increase the current minimum wage of $10.95 by nearly 37% by March of next year and continue to tie future increases to inflation. 
It will apply to federal workers from cleaning and maintenance staff to food service contractors and laborers, sweeping in tipped workers who were previously left out of the last increase under former President Barack Obama. 
White House officials insist it won't increase costs for taxpayers because of benefits including increased worker productivity.
Biden has expressed his belief that strong unions and higher wages can resurrect America's middle class while helping bridge economic and racial inequities, and the executive order is his latest step in support of the organized labor movement.
Biden has often been called the most pro-union president ever by labor groups.
On Monday, he signed another order to create a White House task force that will promote unions and labor organizing, which will be headed by Vice President Kamala Harris. The move was a significant attempt to use the federal government's resources to help stem a decline in union membership in the country.
Since taking office, Biden has also ousted government officials whom unions have called hostile to labor and reversed Trump-era rules that weakened worker protections. He even appeared in a video alluding to workers in an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) facility in Alabama to vote to form a union - an effort that did not end in success. 
Biden tried to insert a federal $15 minimum wage into the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill signed in March, but it was tossed on a procedural matter by the Senate parliamentarian. 
The move to hike base wages for federal contractors was an ask Biden made of his administration in the first few days after taking office and he has vowed to keep pushing for it. 
It builds on an order issued by former President Obama, which required federal contractors to be paid $10.10 an hour indexed to inflation. That rate now stands at $10.95 an hour.
""This would not lead to reduced employment...but would enhance worker productivity and then create higher quality work by boosting workers' health, morale and effort,"" a senior administration official said.

The administration official said the order's impact was reviewed by Biden's Council of Economic Advisors which found the decision would help employers reduce turnover and lower recruitment and training costs.
Biden's latest executive order will require all federal agencies to include the increase in new contract solicitations by January 30, 2022. Two months from then they will be required to implement the base wage into new contracts.
The order also indexes the raise to inflation after 2022, and ends the tipped minimum wage for workers such as those offering seasonal recreational services, food servers and shuttle bus drivers. It also ensures $15 an hour for federal contractors with disabilities.

475,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2021 06:50AM ET</span>",UK retailers report sharpest upturn since 2018: CBI,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers reported the sharpest upturn in sales since 2018 this month as non-essential began to reopen after months of closure, adding to signs of an economic rebound as COVID restrictions ease, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The Confederation of British Industry said its monthly retail sales volume balance jumped to +20 in April from -45 in March, its highest level since September 2018.
Part of the increase reflected the effect of comparing with a year earlier, when Britain was in the midst of its first, most stringent COVID lockdown.
But a separate measure of sales volumes for the time of year also rebounded strongly to its highest since June 2018 and is expected to remain high in May.
Most economists expect Britain's economy to grow by more than 5% this year after shrinking almost 10% in 2020, the sharpest decline in over 300 years.
Shops in England and Wales selling non-essential goods reopened on April 12 after more than three months of closure, while those in Scotland returned to business on Monday. Northern Irish shops are due to welcome customers back on April 30. 
Official retail sales data showed that sales volumes in March had exceeded pre-crisis levels, reflecting a big shift to online shopping which now accounts for more than a third of spending, up from less than a quarter before the pandemic.
However, the CBI said many high-street stores continued to struggle, especially in hard-hit sectors such as clothing.
""Despite progress along the roadmap, the impact of COVID-19 restrictions are still biting hard,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.
""The improvement in retail sales this month was driven by sectors that have performed relatively well during the pandemic, with little immediate rebound expected for more embattled sectors such as clothing, footwear and department stores,"" he added.

The CBI survey took place between March 25 and April 15, and covered 60 retail chains.

LONDON (Reuters) -HSBC Holdings PLC beat quarterly profit forecasts and released $400 million it had set aside to cover bad loans caused by the pandemic, as rapid vaccine rollouts in the United States and Britain raise hopes for an economic recovery.
Europe's biggest bank by assets cautioned, however, that high levels of uncertainty meant it was keeping the bulk of the $3 billion it set aside a year ago to cover potential bad debts.
""We are still being relatively cautious, and we've retained about 70% of the reserve build up we did last year,"" Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters.
HSBC reported on Tuesday profit before tax of $5.78 billion for the three months to March 30, up from $3.21 billion a year ago and well above analysts' average forecast of $3.35 billion as compiled by the bank. 
However, this compared with $6.21 billion in the same period in 2019, showing the lender has some way to go to get back to pre-pandemic profit levels.
HSBC, which makes the bulk of its profits in Asia, said its credit losses for 2021 were likely to be below the medium-term range of 30-40 basis points it forecast in February.
Despite a plan to shift more business to Asia, Chief Executive Noel Quinn said the lender had no immediate plans to move its headquarters from Britain to the region.
London is still ""a good place for the head office of an international bank,"" Quinn told reporters. 
HSBC shares rose 1.7 % in London, the best performers in the benchmark FTSE index and reflecting earlier gains in its Hong Kong-listed shares.
""We are more optimistic than we were back in February, we expect GDP to rebound in every economy in which we operate this year,"" Quinn told Reuters, citing the successful rollout of vaccines in the United States and Britain as a key factor. 
RATES SQUEEZE
HSBC's improved outlook and profits paled in comparison to U.S. rival JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), which earlier this month reported a 400% increase in quarterly profit and released more than $5 billion in bad loan provisions.
That partly reflected the European lender's heavy reliance on global interest rates to make money, which it said in February it would try to address by shifting to more fee-based business, such as wealth management. 
Hibor, the benchmark lending rate in HSBC's most profitable market of Hong Kong, was near 10-year lows for much of the quarter, and the lender's revenue overall fell 5% as such low rates compressed income from lending.
""HSBC is not alone in feeling the squeeze of net interest margins, which tightened again slightly over the quarter, but other banks with huge investment banking arms have been able to capitalise on the trading surge over the past year,"" said Susannah Streeter, analyst at online investment platform  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
While HSBC lagged U.S. peers in its performance, it at least avoided losses from the collapse of U.S. investment fund Archegos that blighted European rival UBS's results.
HSBC had no direct or indirect exposure to Archegos, Quinn told reporters.

HSBC also said it was continuing negotiations for the sale of its French retail banking business, but no final decision had been taken. Reuters reported last month that HSBC had entered negotiations to sell the business, which has 270 branches, to private equity firm Cerberus.
The lender likewise had no update on progress to dispose of its similarly underperforming U.S. retail banking business.

Gross domestic product grew 1.6% during January-March from the previous quarter, the Bank of Korea said Tuesday, higher than the economists’ consensus for a 1.1% expansion. That pushed GDP above its level a year ago for the first time since the start of 2020.
Korea has been one of the better performers throughout the pandemic, thanks to strong overseas demand for its products ranging from chips to cars. BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol said earlier this month he expects growth to reach mid-3% this year, higher than the 3% expected in February.
While Tuesday’s release supports Lee’s optimism, risks to the recovery are growing from worsening local outbreaks. Korea has found it more difficult to peg back fresh infections this year and inoculations are yet to start for the broader public. That suggests social distancing restrictions will remain stringent to tame outbreaks.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",U.S. business spending on equipment ends first quarter on strong note,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods rose solidly in March and shipments surged, cementing expectations that economic growth accelerated in the first quarter as massive government aid and improving public health boosted demand.
The strength in business spending reported by the Commerce Department on Monday joined upbeat data on retail sales and the labor market in setting up the economy for what analysts expect will be its best performance this year in nearly four decades.
Economists saw little impact on investment from President Joe Biden's push for a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax system to make rich people and big companies pay more and help foot the bill for the White House's ambitious economic agenda, including upgrading the nation's crumbling infrastructure. 
Details of the tax proposal could be released before Biden's address to the U.S. Congress on Wednesday. Economists said there was no evidence that former President Donald Trump's deep corporate tax cuts boosted business investment.
""It is hard to fathom how partially rolling back the Trump cuts to pay for the infrastructure plan will meaningfully impede business investment,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""There is little relationship between the effective corporate tax rate and changes in real business equipment spending. Most U.S. corporations have no trouble getting cheap capital and they pay among the lowest effective tax rates in the world.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 0.9% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders fell 0.8% in February after bitterly cold temperatures gripped large parts of the country. 
Though last month's increase was below the 1.5% jump that had been anticipated by economists in a Reuters poll, core capital goods orders surged 10.4% year-on-year in March.
Reports this month showed retail sales raced to a record high in March while the economy created the most jobs in seven months. Factory activity measures are at multi-year highs, indicating continued strength in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
The Biden administration's massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package and increased vaccinations against the virus have allowed for broader economic re-engagement, unleashing pent-up demand, for both goods and services. Biden has also proposed a $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure plan.
Stocks on Wall Street rose. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
STRONG GROWTH
In March, core capital goods orders were boosted by machinery, primary and fabricated metal products, as well as computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components dropped 1.5%.
Shipments of core capital goods rebounded 1.3%, recouping February's 1.1% drop. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
Based on the latest data, economists are forecasting strong business spending on equipment in the first quarter.
""The response of capital spending to the COVID pandemic, with both orders and shipments of core capital goods at a record high, is encouraging for the outlook for 2021,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
With households sitting on at least $2 trillion in excess savings, demand booming and inventories low, businesses are likely to continue investing in equipment to boost production, though raw material and input shortages could be an issue.
""There's still a gap between orders and shipments as producers ramp up capacity and adjust to increasing demand,"" said Will Compernolle, a senior economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""The increase in the orders backlog is especially bad in core capital goods, suggesting accelerating capital spending."" 
The government's snapshot of first-quarter GDP on Thursday will likely show the economy grew at a 6.1% annualized rate, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would be the a second fastest growth pace since the third quarter of 2003 and would follow a 4.3% rate of expansion in the final three months of 2020. 
The economy grew at a record 33.4% pace in the third quarter of 2020 after contracting at a historic 31.4% rate in the April-June period. Growth is expected to top 7.0% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984. It would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rose 0.5% in March after falling 0.9% February. They were restrained by a 1.7% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 2.0% drop in February.
Orders for civilian aircraft tumbled 46.9%. That was despite Boeing (NYSE:BA) reporting on its website that it had received 196 aircraft orders last month compared to 82 in February. Last month's orders included 185 737 MAX jets. The U.S. government late last year lifted a 20-month grounding of the aircraft that was put in place after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts shot up 5.5% in March after plunging 9.1% in February. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products also has been impacted.

Unfilled durable goods orders rose in March for the third straight month.

479,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",U.S. bank appetite for Treasuries unfazed after Fed ends regulatory relief,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. banks' demand for Treasury securities has not dimmed, contrary to expectations, since the Federal Reserve let expire a waiver to a capital adequacy regulation granted early in the pandemic, even as firms seek to raise more capital via debt issuance instead. 
That should prevent spikes in U.S. Treasury yields and keep them in a narrow range this year.
The waiver to the supplementary leverage ratio expired on March 31. That means big banks, as of April 1, have resumed holding more loss-absorbing capital against U.S. Treasuries and central bank deposits.
The Fed also said it would undertake a formal review of the SLR given concerns it is no longer functioning as intended with the central bank's COVID-19 monetary policy measures.
""When we were all talking about the SLR a couple of months ago, we were worried that the exemptions will expire... and banks would sell Treasuries, but the SLR (exemption) went away, and we didn't really see significant selling pressure,"" said Dan Krieter, interest rates strategist at BMO Capital in Chicago. 
Along with other investors, some bank buying has lifted Treasury prices since the beginning of the month, pushing U.S. 10-year yields about 20 basis points lower. They were last at 1.572%. 
Instead of selling Treasuries to meet the capital ratios, analysts said banks are issuing debt. By issuing debt, a bank raises capital against its assets, lifting capital ratios. 
Bank issuers are jumping in to take advantage of the low cost of capital with an eye to the future amid potentially higher rates and borrowing costs, said Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank in London.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have or are planning to issue a total of $40 billion in debt, according to media reports.
JPMorgan's $13 billion bond sale on April 15 was briefly an industry record until it was topped the next day by Bank of America's $15 billion offering.
""The Fed has also hinted heavily at a permanent tweak to SLR calculations that likely prevented any large selling of Treasuries,"" BMO's Krieter said. 
The latest Fed data on primary dealer holdings of Treasuries, one component of bank ownership of U.S. government debt, showed a slight increase of their Treasury inventory as of April 14, to $125.6 billion, from a week earlier. 
Primary dealer holdings did decline from end-February to mid-March as banks braced for the expiration of the SLR exemption, data showed.
U.S. banks currently hold between 8%-10% of publicly available Treasury securities, according to Fed data. That is a major chunk that could move yields if there are reallocations away from Treasuries. 
In April 2020, the Fed excluded Treasuries and central bank deposits from the leverage ratio until March 31, a move aimed at easing Treasury market stress and encouraging banks to lend.
""From my understanding, there weren't many banks that have been using the SLR exemption on their Treasury holdings anyway,"" said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at broker-dealer Incapital.
DEBT ISSUANCE VS SELLING TREASURIES
Issuing debt is far more advantageous to banks compared with selling Treasuries, analysts said, even though they could lose money doing so.
""Funding a portfolio of bank reserves and Treasuries with unsecured bank debt is likely a negative arbitrage proposition,"" said BMO's Krieter. ""Interest on reserves don't earn much and they earn less than what you're paying for the debt that funds it.""
But Krieter noted that selling Treasuries has been a much more expensive exercise than issuing debt.
""To maintain a certain SLR, you might sell Treasuries and then presumably buy them back at a higher market price once the permanent exemption comes,"" Krieter said. 

""In this example, you're paying the full bid/ask spread on a Treasury portfolio worth tens of billions of dollars.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. recreational vehicle industry continued its pandemic-driven boom in the first quarter of 2021, underscoring the lingering impact of the health and economic crisis on American consumer buying and leisure-time habits.
Wholesale shipments of RVs in North America, which surged as people sought ways to safely travel during the COVID-19 crisis, hit a record 148,507 units in the first quarter, nearly 10% above the previous record set in the first quarter of 2018, according to a survey of manufacturers by the RV Industry Association which was seen by Reuters. The data is being released later Monday morning.
The survey also found the industry shipped 54,291 RVs in March, which was more than in any previous month in the industry's history.
Other types of outdoor-oriented industries have also boomed during the pandemic. 
Sales of swimming pools, boats, and all-terrain vehicles all surged after initial lockdowns were lifted last year. Some manufacturers are reporting shortages of parts and other supply chain constraints amid the upswing in manufacturing. Labor shortages also are bedeviling the industry, which is struggling to fill jobs in production hubs like northern Indiana.
The RV association figures dovetail with U.S. Census Bureau data released earlier on Monday showing orders for long-lasting manufactured products - everything from airplanes and automobiles to refrigerators and computers - rose 0.5% in March from the previous month to $256.3 billion, one of the highest monthly totals on record. Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - so-called core durable goods orders - rose 0.9%, slightly less than expected.
New orders for all categories of motor vehicles and parts rose by 5.5% in March to $60.5 billion. Motor vehicle shipments were up 5.8% from February.

481,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 06:15AM ET</span>",Analysis: Fed's 'maximum employment' push may fall short in post-pandemic economy,"By Howard Schneider
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has promised to help restore the U.S. economy to ""maximum employment,"" and is pointing to the months just before the coronavirus pandemic as the touchstone for what that might mean.
Yet early evidence from the reopening of the economy suggests the push to reach that goal may be elusive, or at best a more drawn-out process, as the labor market shifts away from the types of jobs lost in 2020, is potentially further transformed by massive infrastructure spending, and sees some workers quit job-seeking altogether.
Economists say they don't see troubling job bottlenecks in the near term. Some employers have complained about not being to find enough workers, though that problem is expected to ease as schools and childcare facilities reopen, allowing workers to return to their jobs, and the hard-hit hospitality and retail sectors start bulking up their workforces. 
But they may also not be far off if the pandemic leads to an economy more reliant on technology and less on people in the service sector, and the Biden administration's spending plans boost demand for construction, family care and other areas where the unemployed have a different set of skills and, perhaps, preferences.
""There is no broad-based constraint when you have 8.5 million fewer jobs"" than existed at the pandemic's onset, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. Daco expects the economy to add jobs at a fast clip this year, but he said hiring could slow as the occupational mix changes and more older people use the pandemic as a reason to retire. 
""Yes, it will be an impediment to a full recovery and, yes, it will take longer,"" Daco said of the need for workers to shift skills and industries, and of possible limits to how far labor force participation will rise.
THE QUEST FOR LAST YEAR
The Fed is not expected to change its policy guidance after its two-day meeting this week, though it is likely to give a rosier view of the employment situation in the wake of the 916,000 jobs added in March and expectations of further growth through the summer.
The policy statement and Fed Chief Jerome Powell's news conference after the meeting are expected to shine some light on whether the employment landscape has changed the U.S. central bank's plans to leave its key overnight interest rate near zero for an extended time and to continue buying $120 billion in bonds each month.
Huge shortfalls remain, though: Payroll jobs peaked at 152.5 million in February of last year, compared with 144.1 million last month. The share of adults working or looking for work, known as the labor force participation rate, hit a 7-year high of 63.4% in January 2020, reversing what seemed an embedded decline. It fell when the pandemic struck and was at 61.5% last month, representing nearly 4 million additional people not looking for work.
For a graphic on Labor market index:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/LABORINDEX/nmopaoxozpa/chart.png
The best-case scenario is for the economy to snap back to those earlier conditions, though Fed policymakers say they will be patient and only dial back support if inflation surges in unanticipated ways. When the last U.S. recession ended in 2009, it took several years before the most positive trends took hold, and Fed officials will be reluctant to accept that won't happen again.
Yet even as rising COVID-19 vaccination rates promise a more fully open economy, a job market realignment appears underway. Hiring is shifting towards businesses that make and move goods, as well as to those in construction, pharmaceuticals and other fields that have done well during the pandemic and may be buoyed further by ongoing work from home, online shopping, and other trends.
Job postings in those sectors are up 50% or more compared to February 2020, while those for the hospitality and tourism trades remain 17% lower, according to hiring site Indeed.
Analysis of new job postings by analytics firm Chmura projects employment in retail, food service and accommodation will remain well below pre-pandemic levels at least through the end of this year.

A 'DIFFERENT' ECONOMY
If sidelined workers and new job seekers don't smoothly shift to the occupations demanded in the post-pandemic economy, it could limit what ""maximum employment"" turns out to be.
The constraint could reveal itself through a labor force participation rate not climbing back to prior levels. A recent New York Fed survey pointed that way, with a declining number of people expecting to work beyond the age of 67. A surprising return of older workers boosted labor force growth during the last economic expansion, but the reverse is possible now.
It could also show up in faster wage increases for some industries, particularly if the Biden administration's infrastructure spending stretches the supply of skilled workers. Construction employment in March, for example, was only about 2% below its pre-pandemic level.
""There are still people on the sidelines that could come back. But are they in the right locations and with the right skills?"" said Chmura Chief Executive Officer Christine Chmura. ""Probably not. That will drive wages up."" 
Higher wages and a speedier return to full employment are part of the rationale for the White House-backed $2.3 trillion infrastructure package under consideration in Congress, and a key phase could be approaching. 
Enhanced federal unemployment benefits end in September, which will likely push some people back into the job market; rising vaccinations should allow more of the economy to reopen this summer; and Congress will decide how much of President Joe Biden's program to authorize.
Billed as a ""transformational"" plan, the administration's infrastructure proposal acknowledges worker training will need to keep step, with tens of billions of dollars set aside for community college programs, apprenticeships, and efforts to shift displaced workers into new careers.
The Fed will be watching to see how it fits together.

""The economy that we're going back to is going to be different from the one that we had,"" Powell said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" program earlier this month, adding that the changes ""will make it challenging"" for people who became unemployed during the pandemic to go back to work.

482,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 04:45AM ET</span>","German Business Outlook Worsens Amid Infections, Supply Concerns","(Bloomberg) -- German businesses unexpectedly became more pessimistic about the economic outlook as the country continues to battle a stubbornly high rate of coronavirus infections and supply constraints weigh on the recovery.
The Ifo institute’s gauge of expectations for the next six months fell to 99.5 in April from 100.3. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted a gain. At the same time, an assessment of current conditions improved.
While Germany has significantly sped up its vaccination campaign, the infection rate is high and businesses are facing severe curbs on activity. Nighttime curfews have been in place since Saturday across vast parts of the country, and many shops were forced shut after the government tightened restrictions.
“Both the third wave of infections and bottlenecks in intermediate products are impeding Germany’s economic recovery,” Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
Surveys of purchasing managers on Friday suggested that the wider euro area is turning the the page on the pandemic, after on-and-off lockdowns dragged it into a double-dip recession.
Services grew in April for the first time in eight months, a milestone for a sector that has been hamstrung by some of the worst restrictions since the outbreak. The region’s manufacturing upturn, the strongest in more than two decades of data collection, continued to be led by Germany.
The recovery is expected to gain momentum in the second half of the year, as lockdowns ease and the European Union’s 800 billion-euro ($966 billion) recovery fund is being rolled out.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2021 01:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: New U.S. credit benchmarks gain traction as Libor deadline approaches,"By Karen Brettell
(Reuters) - New U.S. bank credit benchmarks are expected to gain traction in the coming months as the deadline to phase out exposure to the discredited Libor approaches, even as regulators continue to push an alternative called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).
Investors are facing a year-end deadline to stop basing new loans and trades on Libor, an acronym for the London Interbank Offered Rate. Some Libor rates will stop being published at the after Dec. 31, while others are scheduled to end in mid-2023.
Libor is being phased out as a reference rate due to concerns about the amount of derivatives using the rate, which in many cases is based on assumptions about their borrowing costs and not actual trades, and after it was manipulated before and during the financial crisis.
The shift will require more than $200 trillion in trades and loans to move to new benchmarks. The move will also likely result in several new indexes gaining prominence, reducing the historical reliance on just one key rate.
Most derivatives contracts based on Libor are expected to migrate to SOFR, the benchmark endorsed by regulators to replace Libor. This index is based on around $1 trillion in daily loans in the U.S. overnight repurchase agreement market.
But many banks and investors want a rate that includes a bank credit component for loans and will instead turn to alternatives.
Richard Sandor, chairman and CEO of the American Financial Exchange, which offers the Ameribor index, said that the shift away from Libor is an opportunity that “occurs once in 100 years,” adding that he has “never been more bullish.”
Ameribor and Bloomberg’s Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY) are gaining interest as benchmarks for loans, though the move is in its early stages. ICE Benchmark Administration, part of the Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE), also plans to offer the U.S. Dollar ICE Bank Yield Index as a Libor replacement.
Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) said this month that it will use Ameribor as a replacement for Libor in most of its non-syndicated commercial loans.
Banks want loans to include a measure of their borrowing rates in case these costs increase.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) also said last week that it has issued a $1 billion, six-month floating rate note referencing Bloomberg’s index. Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have both indicated that BSBY meets their requirements as a money market reference rate, opening the door to money fund investments in notes based on the index.
“BSBY could become an increasingly common benchmark rate. It has several desirable features relative to SOFR,” said Daniel Krieter and Daniel Belton, analysts at BMO Capital Markets.
Market participants were frustrated after the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), a group of market participants that selected SOFR to replace Libor, said in March that it will not be able to recommend a forward looking SOFR rate by mid-year, its former target date.
The CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) has since said that it will offer SOFR term rates based on its SOFR futures trading.
The New York Federal Reserve began publishing SOFR in April 2018, but the shift away from Libor has been slow.
(GRAPHIC: USD Libor Exposures - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovaazmlva/Libor.PNG) 
Around $223 trillion worth of contracts now reference U.S. dollar Libor, compared with $199 trillion at the end of 2016, the ARRC said last month.
Most derivatives are expected to shift to SOFR, though a portion of the market used to hedge loans is expected to reference the credit alternatives.
Trading in the CME Group’s SOFR futures rose to a record 112,000 average daily contract volume in the first quarter, though this remains well below the 2.72 million in average daily contract volumes for Eurodollar futures based on Libor.
The CME has said that it will shift any remaining eurodollar contracts based on Libor to SOFR futures when the Libor rate stops being published in mid-2023.
For many, the solution going forward may also be a hybrid that includes SOFR as a base and adds a credit component when desired.

“I’m pretty much convinced SOFR will be the dominant rate going forward and you will have participants who will choose to add a systemic spread onto that to take you to something like a synthetic Libor,” said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research, Americas, at ING.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's services prices showed signs of a pick-up in March as advertising and transportation fees rose, data showed on Monday, suggesting the economy was recovering moderately from last year's severe hit as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.
But the third state of emergency, rolled out on Sunday to combat a resurgence of new COVID-19 infections, clouds the outlook, with requests for retailers to close likely to hurt consumption.
""There might have been some pent-up demand in March that drove up prices, though there's huge uncertainty on the outlook given the new state of emergency,"" Shigeru Shimizu, head of the Bank of Japan's price statistics division, told a briefing.
The services producer price index, which tracks the price companies charge each other for services, rose 0.7% in March from a year earlier, BOJ data showed on Monday.
It was the first increase in six months and followed a flat reading in February.
While part of the rise was due to the base effect of last year's plunge, television and internet advertisement fees were up on demand from cellphone carriers and other services.
Cargo transportation prices also rebounded on tighter supply as airlines slashed the number of flights, the data showed.
Services prices have remained weak even as goods prices rose due to the severe blow the pandemic dealt to services consumption, adding to downward pressure from persistently slow wage growth in Japan.

Japan's core consumer prices fell for the eighth straight month in March, separate data showed on Friday, underscoring the challenge the BOJ faces in hitting its 2% inflation target.

485,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 25, 2021 06:00PM ET</span>",China’s Economy Continues Booming After Record First Quarter,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy continued to boom in April from the record growth in the first quarter, with strong exports and rising business confidence supporting the recovery.
That’s the outlook of an aggregate index combining eight early indicators tracked by Bloomberg, which remained unchanged from March in strong expansionary territory. Some of the strength this month may be exaggerated by the comparison with April 2020, when the country was still struggling to recover and reopen after a lockdown to contain the world’s first coronavirus cases.
Confidence among small and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs, picked up for a second month in a survey of more than 500 companies by Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc., with the rise in expectations pointing to even stronger performance in the current quarter compared to the first three months of the year.
“Export-oriented SMEs continued to outperform domestically-focused SMEs, with faster production and higher output price gains,” according to the Standard Chartered’s economists Lan Shen and Ding Shuang. “The services sector is catching up at a faster pace, driven by the transport and logistics, IT, and commercial services industries, while the catering and accommodation sectors remain sluggish.”
The improvement in services was due to the “removal of restrictive measures and vaccine rollout,” they wrote in a report. “While export demand stayed resilient, domestic demand also started to pick up.”
Three Reasons to Believe in the Boom on Bloomberg Trade Tracker
The strength of overseas demand can be seen in South Korea’s exports in the first 20 days of the month, which jumped more than 45% compared to the same period a year earlier, the fastest pace since 2011.
Global demand has driven up commodity costs, boosting factory-gate inflation in China to its highest since 2017, according to Bloomberg Economics’ price tracker. Copper prices approached the nine-year highs reached in February, while steel futures in China reached new peaks even as rebar stockpiles shrank slightly.
China’s stock market moved higher in April, with the benchmark index of 300 mainland companies bouncing back to levels above 5,100.
Home sales continued to grow in the month, although the pace was less robust than in March. Regulators have been trying to control housing risks after monetary easing spurred a rebound in the residential market, with buyers using property to hedge against inflation. Car sales growth in the same period slowed slightly.

The bank said in a note to clients that it now expects British gross domestic product to grow by a ""striking"" 7.8% this year, ""above our expectations for the U.S.""
A Reuters poll of analysts published on April 13 showed an average forecast for growth of 5.0% in the UK, the world's fifth-biggest economy in 2021. The International Monetary Fund has projected a 5.3% expansion.
But since those forecasts were made there have been signs of an acceleration in the pace of recovery with the country now having given a first coronavirus vaccine to more than half of its total population.
""The UK economy is rebounding sharply from the Covid crisis,"" Goldman Sachs said.
""The April flash PMI was much stronger than expected in the UK, with the services PMI moving strongly further into expansionary territory,"" it said.
The bank also noted a much-stronger-than-expected 5.4% monthly jump in retail sales in March.
The note did not provide a comparison forecast for U.S. economic growth this year. In February, Goldman said it expected U.S. GDP would grow by 6.8% in 2021 as President Joe Biden pushed ahead with a huge fiscal stimulus programme.
Britain's economy shrank by nearly 10% last year as it was hit by longer coronavirus lockdowns than many of its peers. By comparison, the U.S. economy shrank by an estimated 3.5%, according to the IMF. 

On Saturday, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent was quoted as saying he expected ""very rapid growth at least over the next couple of quarters"" as the country lifts its coronavirus restrictions.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2021 11:55AM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing, new homes sales underscore booming economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity powered ahead in early April, though manufacturers increasingly struggled to source raw materials and other inputs as a reopening economy leads to a boom in domestic demand, which could slow momentum in the months ahead.
The flow of strong economic data continued with another report on Friday showing new home sales racing to a more than 14-1/2-year high in March. The economy is being boosted by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package and increased vaccinations against the virus.
Retail sales jumped to a record high in March and hiring accelerated, cementing expectations for robust growth in the first quarter and setting up the economy for what could be its best performance in nearly four decades.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 60.6 in the first half of this month. That was the highest reading since the series started in May 2007 and followed 59.1 in March. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 60.5 in early April. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
""The U.S. economy is enjoying a strong start to the second quarter, firing on all cylinders as loosening virus restrictions, an impressive vaccine roll-out, a brighter outlook and stimulus measures all helped boost demand,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
More than half of American adults have had at least one vaccine dose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A third of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated. That, together with the fiscal stimulus, has allowed for broader economic re-engagement.
But the strong demand is pushing against supply constraints. The pandemic has disrupted labor at factories and their suppliers, causing shortages that are boosting prices of materials and other inputs. 
The IHS Markit survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to the highest level since July 2008. It attributed the higher input prices to ""severe supplier shortages and marked rises in transportation fees.""
The continued rise in input costs is one of many factors expected to drive inflation above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has expressed confidence that the supply chains will adapt and become more efficient, and prevent prices from remaining higher for a sustained period. 
According to IHS Market supply shortages were causing backlogs of uncompleted work ""of a magnitude not surpassed for over seven years."" The raw material squeeze is most evident in the automobile industry, where a global semiconductor shortage has forced production cuts at motor vehicle assembly plants. 
Supply challenges have also spilled over to the housing market, where builders are struggling with record lumber prices, threatening to worsen an already acute shortage of previously owned homes available for sale. 
A report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed new single-family home sales surged 20.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.021 million units last month, the highest since August 2006.
The sales pace blew past economists' expectations for 886,000 units. The market for new homes is benefiting from the dearth of previously owned home.
""Demand is causing new homes to be bought virtually as soon as they hit the market,"" said from Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
The data helped to lift stocks on Wall Street. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
TIGHT INVENTORY
The pandemic is driving demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations as millions of Americans continued to work from home and attend classes remotely. Homebuilders, however, are also grappling with shortages of land and workers. 
New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits. Sales soared 66.8% year-on-year in March.
Sales surged in the South, Midwest and Northeast, but fell in the West. They were concentrated in the $200,000-$399,999 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 3% of transactions last month.
The median new house price rose 0.8% from a year earlier to $330,800 in March. The National Association of Realtors reported on Thursday that sales of previously owned homes declined for a second straight month in March, with prices hitting an all-time high as supply remained near record lows. 
There were 307,000 new homes on the market last month, unchanged from February. At March's sales pace it would take 3.6 months to clear the supply, down from 4.4 months in February. 
""Inventories remain tight and while that should be a positive for home building activity, a lack of availability will likely remain a headwind for sales in the near term,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

About 74% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

The chances of resolving cases through out-of-court settlements remain uncertain, with many banks waiting for a Polish Supreme Court sitting on May 11 before they decide whether to sign up to a settlement plan proposed by financial regulator KNF.
Thousands of Polish borrowers took out franc loans more than a decade ago to take advantage of low Swiss interest rates but then faced ballooning repayments when the zloty weakened sharply against the Swiss currency.
""The KNF's proposal minimises the bank's losses and completely eliminates the currency risk on the client's side,"" said chief financial officer Rafal Kozlowski. 
""A settlement is always better for the bank than a court dispute, we avoid legal costs, it relieves the client of debt and gives (the bank) a tax shield.""
PKO BP is so far the only bank to have committed itself to the KNF scheme. Kozlowski said that according to a survey carried out by the bank two thirds of customers would be ready to accept settlements under the KNF plan.
With many other banks waiting for the Supreme Court ruling before making a decision on the settlement plan, there had been speculation in Polish media that PKO BP shareholders would opt to put off the decision regarding the fund.
However, a motion at Friday's Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to adjourn proceedings until May 21 did not get the two thirds majority needed to pass.
Shareholders also accepted the management board's proposal not to vote on a 4.5 billion zloty share repurchase programme.

LONDON (Reuters) -The euro zone's recovery from its pandemic-induced economic downturn was much stronger than expected in April as the service industry adapted to lockdowns and made a surprise return to growth, a survey showed.
With the continent facing a fresh wave of coronavirus infections governments have reimposed strict curbs to contain the spread, forcing some businesses to close and encouraging citizens to stay home. 
That meant the economy was expected to recover at a much weaker rate this quarter than had been expected only a month previously, according to a Reuters poll last week. [ECILT/EU]
But IHS Markit's flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to a nine month high of 53.7 from March's 53.2, confounding expectations in a Reuters poll for a dip to 52.8. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
""The euro zone economy looks like it's on the brink of a startling recovery. Only months ago it seemed to be rapidly turning into the weak link among advanced markets, being slow out the gates with vaccinations, seeing lockdowns extended and having weaker fiscal support,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
""True, first-quarter GDP growth figures are set to still show declines, but the April PMI adds to a lot of encouraging underlying numbers.""
On Thursday, the European Central Bank kept its copious stimulus flowing to support the economy as President Christine Lagarde said there were clear signs of improvement.
""Progress with vaccination campaigns and an envisaged gradual relaxation of containment measures underpin expectations of a firm rebound in economic activity in the course of 2021,"" she told a press conference.
A PMI for the dominant service industry rose to 50.3 from last month's 49.6, beating the median forecast in the Reuters poll for a decline to 49.1.
Meanwhile, factories in the currency union had their most active month since the survey began in mid-1997.
An index measuring output nudged up to survey high.
Germany's PMI gave an upbeat outlook for Europe's largest economy with factories continuing to churn out goods at a near-record pace although activity in the services sector remained sluggish due to coronavirus curbs.
French business activity expanded more strongly than forecast, according to its survey, as the euro zone's second-biggest economy showed signs of resilience.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, a deluge of new orders swept through businesses as the country lifted some of its COVID-19 restrictions, pointing to a rapid rebound.
COSTS RISING
Supply-side disruptions left factories facing soaring costs for raw materials. The euro zone input prices index climbed to a near-record high and manufacturers were only able to pass some of that increase on to customers.
""The composite input prices PMI reached its highest level in around a decade, with supply shortages driving up input costs in the manufacturing sector. These should hopefully prove temporary,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics. 
Still, any signs of pricing pressures may be welcomed by the ECB which has struggled to get inflation anywhere near its target. 
With some businesses staying open - or preparing to reopen - services firms increased headcount at the fastest pace since before Europe faced the full brunt of the pandemic.
Hopes slow vaccination programmes in the bloc accelerate and allow a return to some form of normality sent optimism about the coming year higher.

The composite future output index climbed to 68.8 from 67.9, the highest since IHS Markit started collating the data in July 2012. 
Euro zone consumer confidence rose 2.7 points in April from March, European Commission figures on Thursday showed.

LONDON (Reuters) -A deluge of new orders swept through British businesses in April as the country lifted some of its COVID-19 restrictions, according to a survey on Friday that pointed to a rapid rebound for the pandemic-hit UK economy.
The preliminary ""flash"" reading of the UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 60.0 in April from 56.4 in March, its highest reading since November 2013. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a smaller rise to 58.2.
The survey added to signs that the world's fifth-biggest economy, which shrank by nearly 10% in 2020, is shaping up for a rapid recovery helped by the fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations.
Official data published earlier on Friday showed retail sales jumped by much more than expected in March even with many shops still closed last month.
Clothing retailers able to sell online benefitted especially as consumers got ready to venture out after being locked down for much of the past year.
Retailers also reported a rise in purchases of mobility equipment as older people left their homes after their vaccinations and there was a jump in sales at garden centres, reflecting the boom in gardening over the past year.
Non-essential retailers in England reopened on April 12 along with pubs and restaurants operating outdoors, and from May 17 more restrictions are due to be lifted to allow indoor hospitality, performances and sporting events.
Both services and manufacturing companies increased staffing this month in preparation, the PMI survey showed.
""We now seem to be seeing the first evidence of the release of the pent-up demand that was built up over the many months of lockdown as restraints begin to be lifted,"" said Rhys Herbert, senior economist at Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank.
Sterling was little changed by the report.
The evidence of momentum in Britain came after data unexpectedly showed the euro zone economy also picked up pace April, despite slower progress in vaccinating the bloc's population.
Another survey published on Friday showed British consumer confidence this month rose to its highest since the start of the pandemic.
INFLATION UNCERTAINTY
The PMI for Britain's services sector rose to 60.1 in April from 56.3 in March, the highest reading since August 2014 and driven by consumer-facing businesses.
The PMI for the manufacturing sector, which accounts for around 10% of British economic output, rose to its highest since 1994 at 60.7, up from 58.9 in March. 
As in previous months, the reading was flattered by the way the survey interprets supply chain delays caused by the pandemic and to a lesser extent Brexit.

Both manufacturers and services companies reported rapid increases in cost pressures - something the Bank of England will be keeping an eye on.
""These prices will inevitably feed through to higher inflation as we head into the summer, though there's much uncertainty as to how long the inflationary impact will last,"" IHS Markit chief business economist Chris Williamson said.

LONDON (Reuters) -British retail sales jumped last month before a partial lifting of coronavirus restrictions, suggesting an economic rebound is under way, but official data also showed record peacetime government borrowing.
Sales volumes leapt by 5.4% in March from February with clothing retailers able to sell online benefiting especially as consumers got ready to venture out after being locked down for much of the past year.
Retailers also reported a rise in purchases of mobility equipment as older people left their homes after their vaccinations and there was a jump in sales at garden centres, reflecting the boom in gardening over the past year.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a much smaller month-on-month increase of 1.5%.
""March's strong rise in retail sales showed that the economy made a fair bit of progress even before non-essential retailers re-opened in April,"" said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics. 
Sales were up 1.6% from February last year, before the pandemic hit, the Office for National Statistics said.
Separate data underscored the huge cost of the government's emergency programmes to prop up the economy last year.
Britain's government borrowed 303.1 billion pounds ($420.1 billion) in the 2020/21 financial year, which ended last month, a surge of 246 billion pounds on the previous year and the biggest share of the economy in peacetime.
Borrowing stood at 14.5% of economic output, the highest such ratio since 1946, after World War Two, when it was 15.2%.
Public debt stood at 2.14 trillion pounds, almost 98% of gross domestic product.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak last year ramped up spending on jobs and income protection, welfare and the health service and cut taxes as swathes of the economy were closed.
Britain's budget forecaster predicted in early March that overall borrowing would hit 355 billion pounds in 2020/21, but it has said since then it would probably come in a bit lower.
Friday's figures do not include 27.2 billion pounds of COVID-19 loan programme write-offs that the forecasters estimate will need to be made.
They have said borrowing in the current 2021/22 year will fall to 234 billion pounds, more than four times the deficit in 2019/20.
Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that forecast was now looking too high, given the prospect of a stronger economic recovery this year.
Britain's debt office said it planned to issue 252.6 billion pounds of government bonds in 2021/22, a 43.3 billion-pound cut to its March estimate.
SPENDING AND RECOVERY
Economic output slumped by almost 10% last year, its biggest collapse in more than three centuries, but it is expected to grow by more than 5% in 2021 and 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The Bank of England is waiting to see the extent to which households spend their lockdown savings as it assesses how long it needs to keep its huge stimulus plan in place.
British consumer sentiment hit its highest since the start of the pandemic this month, a survey showed, but the increase was smaller than economists had expected.

The ONS said retail sales were up 7.2% compared with March 2020 when the pandemic was spreading in most Western economies.
The ONS said the share of shopping done online slipped from a record high in February to 34.7% in March.

Purchasing managers’ indexes from the euro area’s two largest economies showed businesses were confident at the start of the second quarter that they’ll soon be able to put the pandemic crisis behind them, even as lockdowns persist amid continuously high infections.
“The short-term outlook is continuing to strengthen for French businesses,” said IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr. “Previously growth had remained elusive due to an ongoing decline in the service sector.”
France’s services PMI rose to an 8-month high in April, while a tightening of coronavirus restrictions in Germany curbed a rebound in the sector that had started in March.
German factories, meanwhile, saw their order stock increase at the fastest pace in a decade. Shortages of raw materials and freight capacity pushed up input costs to the highest since 2011 and output prices to strongest in more than two years.

IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the manufacturing sector edged down only slightly to 66.4 from its record high of 66.6 reached in March. This beat a Reuters poll forecast for a reading of 65.8.
The PMI for activity in the services sector fell to 50.1 from 51.5. This was a bit weaker than expected but still above the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction.
As a result, the preliminary composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, eased to 56.0 from its 37-month high of 57.3 in the previous month.
Companies hired new staff at a pace not seen since October 2018 and their backlogs of work increased to the highest level in more than 10 years, the survey showed.
In a sign of supply chain problems, input prices hit a 10-year high but firms managed to pass on their increased costs through higher output prices, suggesting that inflationary pressures could be building up.
""The imbalance of demand and supply across manufacturing supply chains continues to drive up businesses' costs, which are now rising at the fastest rate for more than a decade,"" IHS Markit analyst Phil Smith said.
He added, however, that while factory gate prices were more and more in line with strong demand for goods, services firms remained cautious with their pricing, meaning that the spillover effects to overall consumer prices could be limited.
The government is expected to raise its 2021 GDP growth forecast next Tuesday after Economy Minister Peter Altmaier hinted earlier this month that Berlin was mulling an upward-revision to its 3% estimate.

Germany is struggling to contain an aggressive third wave of coronavirus infections as efforts are complicated by the more contagious B117 variant of the coronavirus and a relatively slow introduction of vaccines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japanese mega-bank Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group has cut six members of its U.S. team, four in sell-side markets research, sales and trading, and two investment-banking advisors, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The job reductions were made in the last week, the source said, as the bank expands its fixed-income trading and debt capital markets businesses, for which has been hiring since mid-2020. 
With assets worth roughly $3.1 trillion, MUFG is hoping to use its sizeable balance sheet to venture further into primary and secondary fixed-income markets, the source said. Low borrowing costs globally and a stock market rally have produced a boom in capital markets activity this year.
The reshuffle at MUFG also reflects a long-running decline in sell-side analysis. Buy-side advisory firm Substantive Research in November published results https://substantiveresearch.com/matter/value-of-analyst-meetings-has-fallen-by-47-since-january-2020 of a survey showing that asset managers have nearly halved the prices they're willing to pay for sell-side research since January 2020, as meetings with analysts, which are typically in person, have become virtual.
Among those laid off was John Herrmann, who had previously been the director of interest rate strategy in MUFG's New York office, the source said. 
In response to a request for comment, Herrmann said ""I had a very good run for 8-1/2 years at MUFG. I was hoping to serve our clients for several more years, but a new horizon awaits. I hope to be back soon doing what I do best: forecasting the economy, the FOMC and the yield curve.""

Constrained resources at the bank meant that hiring Joyce, along with two capital markets strategists also from Deutsche Bank - Hailey Orr and Stephanie Kendal - came at the expense of existing MUFG employees, according to the source. 
On April 21, MUFG also announced https://www.mufgamericas.com/who-we-are/news/mufg-further-strengthens-its-us-macro-trading-platform-fixed-income-industry-veteran-hire that it had hired George Goncalves from rival  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) as head of U.S. macro strategy, to bolster its fixed income trading platform.

The au Jibun Bank Japan’s purchasing managers index for manufacturing sector activity rose 0.6 point to 53.3, while its measure of service sector activity was unchanged at 48.3. Numbers above 50 indicate an expansion and those below 50 signal a contraction.
Factory activity has been supported by a recovery in exports to the U.S. and China, Japan’s most important trade partners. Service activity took a hit from ongoing restrictions on businesses as Japan struggles to contain the latest wave of virus infections, forcing the government to recommend reinstating a state of emergency in key economic hubs such as Tokyo and Osaka.
“The boost in private sector activity was led by the manufacturing sector, as the larger services sector saw business activity deteriorate,” said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey. “There is concern the impact of the pandemic will be prolonged further.”
If tighter restrictions are imposed, the emergency will likely limit the economic rebound for the current quarter that is expected following a contraction in the first quarter. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has maintained the government’s stance that the Tokyo Olympics will start in July, as planned, despite the emergency.

The companies signed up for $9.3 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $8.9 billion a year earlier. However, borrowings in March rose 26% from the previous month.
""The equipment finance industry appears poised to take advantage of an economic tailwind that is manifesting itself in an improving labor market, a continued low interest-rate environment, a strong corporate earnings season, and high business confidence that is creating demand for investment in commercial equipment,"" said ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta.  
""ELFA member organizations also report improving portfolio quality, which is reflective of their customers' ability to meet their payment obligations as the pandemic's grip on many businesses loosens."" 
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals rose to 77% in March, from 75.8% in February.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY).
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, reported monthly confidence index of 76.1 in April, an increase from the March reading of 67.7.

A reading of above 50 indicates a positive business outlook.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims hit 13-month low; home sales tumble,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 13-month low last week, suggesting layoffs were subsiding and strengthening expectations for another month of blockbuster job growth in April as a re-opening economy unleashes pent-up demand.
While the labor market recovery is gaining speed, red flags are emerging in the housing market, the economy's star performer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales of previously-owned homes tumbled to a seven-month low in March as prices jumped to a record high amid an acute shortage of houses, other data showed on Thursday. Realtors warned that expensive homes could become a permanent feature of the market, worsening inequality.
Even as the economy is booming and the labor market scars are healing thanks to massive public aid from the government and increased COVID-19 vaccinations, there are still 17.4 million people collecting unemployment checks. 
""We are seeing claims drop across most states, which shows the jobs recovery has become more geographically broad-based,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""However, a growing number of Americans are out of work for longer, and it's those who are tougher to bring back into the labor force.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 547,000 for the week ended April 17, the lowest since mid-March 2020, the Labor Department said. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 617,000 applications for the latest week. 
It was the second straight week that claims were below the 700,000 level since March 2020 when mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses like restaurants and bars were enforced to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections. There were large declines in filings in Texas and New York, as well as decreases in several other states.
Claims have remained elevated because of fraud, especially in California and Ohio. The enhancement of the unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 subsidy, could also be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved. 
The latest Labor Department data on first payments show only a fraction of claims were successful over the past months.
The weekly subsidy and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will run through Sept. 6. Claims jumped to a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.
Including the PUA program, 699,798 people filed claims last week, squeaking below 700,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

BROAD IMPROVEMENT
The United States has expanded COVID-19 vaccination eligibility to most American adults, and more than half that population has had at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A third of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, as well as 26% of the population overall, it said.
That, together with the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, has allowed for broader economic re-engagement. The resulting surge in demand has left businesses scrambling for workers. Retail sales raced to a record high in March and factories are humming.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. First-time filings have dropped from 765,000 in mid-March, boosting hopes for strong employment gains in April. 
The economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months. Employment, however, remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
""Job growth in the spring of 2021 is receiving a boost as better weather allows for more outdoor activity,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Job growth will remain very strong throughout 2021 and into 2022 thanks to vaccination efforts and stimulus payments that are supporting consumer spending.""
But the housing market is backpedaling. Existing home sales dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units last month, the lowest level since August 2020, the National Association of Realtors said in a separate report on Thursday. The plunge reflected a supply squeeze, which boosted the median house price a record 17.2% from a year ago to an all-time high of $329,100. 
Sales are skewed towards large and more expensive homes. The NAR reported intense bidding wars, which it said could lead to discrimination against some buyers.
""Without an increase in supply, the society wealth division will widen with homeowners enjoying sizable equity gains while renters will struggle to become homeowners,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR.
Still, housing remains supported by the recovering labor market. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 34,000 to 3.674 million in the week ended April 10. 
The so-called continuing claims have declined from 23.1 million at the height of the crisis. Part of the drop is likely because of people finding work and exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which is limited to 26 weeks in most states.
For a graphic on Pandemic jobless relief rolls remain high:
https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvoxyxopd/Pasted%20image%201619095828488.png

About 5.6 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended April 3. Another 492,999 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. There were 17.405 million people receiving benefits under all programs in early April.

502,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales drop to seven-month low,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell to a seven-month low in March, pulled down by an acute shortage of properties, which is boosting prices and making owning a house more expensive for some first-time buyers.
Existing home sales dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units last month, the lowest level since August 2020, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Sales fell in all four regions.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales at a rate of 6.19 million units in March. The second straight monthly decline in sales was flagged by a sharp decline in signed contracts and applications for home purchasing loans in February.
Existing home sales, which are counted at the closing of a contract, lag signings by a month or two. That means part of the drop in sales last month was due to harsh weather in February. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, increased 12.3% on a year-on-year basis, remaining well above their pre-pandemic level. 
The housing market is experiencing a dearth of properties available for sale in the wake of strong demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations as the COVID-19 pandemic forced millions of Americans to work from home and schooling to be conducted remotely. 
Though homebuilders have stepped up new home construction, they are grappling with record-high lumber prices as well as shortages of land and workers. 
Increased COVID-19 vaccinations, which are leading to broader economic re-engagement, could allow more homeowners to put houses on the market. The pandemic, now in its second year, likely caused some Americans to delay downsizing, starving the market of much-needed inventory. 
The median existing house price surged a record 17.2% from a year ago to an all-time high of $329,100 in March. But economists do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than speculation, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.
There were 1.07 million previously owned homes on the market in March, up 3.9% compared to February. Supply plunged 28.2% from one year ago. At March's sales pace, it would take 2.1 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.3 months a year ago.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 

First-time buyers accounted for 32% of sales in March, up from 31% in February and down from 34% in March 2020.

Investing.com -- The improvement in the U.S. labor market continued last week as the service sector in particular built on recent gains thanks to the relaxation of lockdown measures across the country.
The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits fell to 547,000 last week, their lowest since the start of the pandemic, from an upwardly-revised 586,000 the week before, the Labor Department said in a weekly release.
The number of continuing claims under regular state programs fell to 3.764 million, from 3.708 million a week earlier. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims.
Analysts had expected initial claims to rise modestly to 617,000.
The broader measure of people claiming benefits under all unemployment-related insurance programs, which has been consistently volatile this year, rose by just under 500,000 to 17.405 million in the week through April 3.
""Unemployment Insurance claims dropped across most states, a positive indication that the decline is broad-based rather than the result of changes in just a few states,"" said Glassdoor senior economist Danial Zhao via Twitter. ""Claims are still over double pre-crisis levels, but at least are making progress.""
The brightening picture from the labor market - also reflected in outside job gains last month - is also being corroborated in other areas, with retail sales in March rising by a thumping 9.8%."

LONDON (Reuters) -British manufacturers' hopes for an economic rebound rose to their strongest in 48 years this month as the country began to recover from the slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Confederation of British Industry said on Thursday.
The CBI said its quarterly survey of manufacturers also pointed to a revival of investment and hiring plans and continued concerns about higher costs.
""Phased reopening has lifted the mood among firms, notably driving orders, employment, and investment plans,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
""However, rising costs are an increasing concern for many businesses, and seem to be putting upward pressure on prices as firms try to protect their margins.""
The CBI said its quarterly business optimism gauge, based on a survey of 288 manufacturers between March 24 and April 14, jumped to +38, the highest since April 1973, from January's reading of -22.
Plans to invest in plant and machinery were the strongest since July 1997, with anecdotal evidence from firms that they had brought forward plans to take advantage of a temporary tax break announced by finance minister Rishi Sunak in March's budget.
""Manufacturers are much more optimistic about the future, now that Brexit is largely in their rear-view mirror and world trade is rebounding,"" economist Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
Export order growth was the highest since April 2019.
However, the CBI's separate monthly survey of manufacturers was somewhat less upbeat, with the orders balance falling to -8 from -5, below forecasts in a Reuters poll for a rise to +2.
The quarterly survey also showed the biggest increase in costs for manufacturers since April 2011.
""Anecdotes from manufacturers point to COVID-related supply disruption such as global container shortages leading to higher costs, with Brexit factors such as higher administration costs playing a compounding role,"" the CBI said.
Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% last year, its biggest annual slump in more than 300 years, and the International Monetary Fund expects it to grow by just over 5% this year and next.

Factories were not directly affected by tougher lockdown rules introduced at the start of the year to control the spread of COVID-19, but many of their customers were.
Restrictions have started to ease following the roll-out of vaccines, with non-essential shops reopening on April 12 and pubs and restaurants resuming outdoor service.

LONDON (Reuters) - English and Welsh shoppers rushed back to clothes and furniture stores last week when they reopened after three months of COVID lockdown restrictions, but the novelty of dining and drinking outside rapidly faded.
The Office for National Statistics said credit and debit purchases of clothes and furniture jumped to 89% of pre-pandemic levels in the week to April 15, up by 26 percentage points on a week earlier.
The figures are based on high-value CHAPS payment data from credit and debit card processors collected by the Bank of England.
This data shows overall card spending rose to 91% of its level in February 2020 last week, up from 83% the week before when the Easter holiday weekend had reduced spending.
The number of shoppers in the week to April 17 rose to 75% of its level two years earlier, up by 31 percentage points on the previous week, and the volume of job adverts held at pre-pandemic levels.
Non-essential retailers in England and Wales reopened on April 12 for the first time since early January, and English pubs and restaurants were allowed to begin serving customers who booked outdoor seating.
The first day of opening brought a rush of diners and drinkers, but the appeal of eating and drinking outdoors in dry but cold weather had faded by the weekend.
Reservations on April 17 stood at 60% of their average level two years ago, down from 79% on April 12, according to data from booking website OpenTable produced for the ONS.

London saw especially weak bookings, with reservations just 44% of pre-pandemic levels.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland, resigned to having much to lose from a global overhaul of how multinational companies are taxed, has embarked on a damage limitation exercise that it hopes will let it and other low-tax economies retain some of their decades-old advantages.
After years of talks, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is confident of finding a consensus this year among 140 countries on rewriting international tax rules for the first time in a generation.
For Ireland, opposing the changes would risk a messier outcome of larger rivals going their own way.
Instead, it is trying to keep a proposed global minimum corporate tax as low as possible and allow companies to cut their tax bills in other ways, such as offsets for research and development - aims it shares with Hungary, another low-tax state and European Union outlier.
Ireland's 12.5% corporate tax rate has helped it beat economies 10 times its size to investments from, among others, the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), who all call it their home in the region.
Global momentum is building towards including a minimum tax that the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden wants set as high as 21%.
That would undermine an economic success story that directly accounts for around one in eight Irish jobs.
""The rate is the front line (for Ireland),"" said PWC Ireland Managing Partner Feargal O'Rourke, who has advised the Irish government and U.S. companies with operations there on corporate tax.
""There's also the question of a minimum rate on what? The method of calculation and how it interacts with, for example, research and development and intellectual property, that's all still in play."" 
Addressing an online tax conference organised by his government that 1,500 global participants signed up to on Wednesday, Irish Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe said any deal had to allow small countries to use tax policy as a legitimate lever to compensate for material advantages enjoyed by larger states.
He also said an agreement must ""accommodate Ireland's 12.5% rate"" and facilitate innovation and investment, a nod to the niche Ireland has carved out as a tax-efficient location to hold intellectual property rights.
ALLIANCE OF SMALL ECONOMIES?
While its regime has been under fire for years - and was the subject of the EU's largest anti-competition order, a 13 billion euro ($15.65 billion) fine that Dublin and Apple overturned in court - Ireland does not have the bloc's lowest corporate tax rate.
Hungary's 9% rate has helped it become a magnet for foreign carmakers including Daimler (OTC:DDAIF)'s Mercedes-Benz. BMW is planning a new assembly line there, while South Korea's SK Innovation has pledged $1.2 billion to build a battery plant.
Sharing Ireland's reservations over a global minimum tax, it too insists exemptions should be carved out for profits generated from real business activity such as research and development.
""During the fight against harmful tax evasion, it is important that this effort should not transform into a fight against competitive tax systems,"" Benedek Nobilis, a head of department at the Hungarian Finance Ministry wrote in an article for financial news website portfolio.hu last week.
Together with countries in the Baltics, Nordics as well as like-minded Singapore, where the corporate tax rate is 17%, Ireland and Hungary have found themselves in an ""alliance of small open economies"" at the OECD, said Gerard Brady, chief economist at Ibec, Ireland's main business lobby group.
Ibec represents Ireland on a business advisory panel to the OECD, where it has also been pushing for companies to be allowed reduce their effective tax rate below any global minimum. The technical basis for that will be what matters, Brady said.

""If they can do an agreement that includes tax incentives for research, recognition of real substantial activities... then a rate that is slightly above 12.5% would still leave Ireland with a competitive offering,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Tokyo will not host its motor show this year because of the global pandemic, organizers said on Thursday, underscoring Japan's struggle to contain both a resurgent outbreak and the widening economic fall-out.
The cancellation comes as the government is expected to issue a third state of emergency for Tokyo and a number of other prefectures that could last for about two weeks, according to media reports. 
The halting of the auto show, a marquee event of the country's most important industry, is also likely to raise more questions about the government's insistence that the delayed Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer.
The chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Akio Toyoda, said the group felt it was difficult to provide a safe environment amid surging coronavirus cases. The show is normally held around late October to early November.
Such cancellations are bad news for an economy that, like many around the world, has been badly hit by the pandemic. Some analysts said another state of emergency could push Japan back into recession if retailers are asked to close during the Golden Week holidays, which start next week and run through early May. 
""The risk of a double-dip recession has clearly heightened,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Securities. ""The impact of imposing curbs on Tokyo and Osaka alone would be quite big.""
Japan has so far avoided an explosive spread of the pandemic that has plagued many Western countries, with total cases so far at about 540,000 and a death toll of 9,707. But the latest rise in infections has stoked alarm, coming just three months before the planned start of the Tokyo Olympics and amid a sluggish vaccination roll-out.
Tokyo 2020 organizers said a policeman who worked with the Olympic torch relay in western Kagawa prefecture had tested positive for the virus.
STRONGER CURBS
With thousands of new cases resulting from highly infectious strains of the virus, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday the government will decide this week whether to declare the state of emergency for major parts of the country.
The governors of Tokyo's neighbouring Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures will request the same emergency measures as the capital, the Nikkei newspaper reported. Four western prefectures are also seeking emergency measures, media have reported, bringing businesses in the large swathes of the country under tighter operating hours.
The government is considering imposing the curbs from April 25 to May 11, Jiji news agency reported. It is also expected to weigh stronger curbs than those issued last time in January, such as requests for department stores and other big retailers to close.
""We need to take stronger and more targeted steps than before including requests (for shops) to close,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura was quoted as saying by Kyodo news agency on Thursday.
Tokyo reported 861 new cases on Thursday, the most since Jan. 29 during the third wave of the pandemic and previous state of emergency. Osaka prefecture reported 1,167, down slightly from a record.
Japan's economy has emerged from last year's severe slump thanks to robust exports. 
But analysts expect GDP to have shrunk in the first quarter due to the hit to consumption from the second emergency curbs that rolled out in January and say a second consecutive contraction in Q2 that would constitute a recession is possible. 

""The timing is not good,"" as it would hit service spending during the spring leisure season, said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute, of the latest curbs.
Tsunoda cut his forecast for second-quarter GDP to a 0.5% quarter-on-quarter rise, half the previously projected pace.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>","Analysis: U.S. banks' bond bonanza driven by extraordinary market conditions, regulatory decisions","By Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Record-breaking Wall Street bank bond offerings in recent days are being driven by a combination of extraordinary market conditions and regulatory decisions that can be traced to the government's pandemic relief efforts, said analysts. 
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) have or are planning to issue a total of $40 billion in debt, according to media reports. JPMorgan's $13 billion April 15 bond sale was briefly an industry record until it was topped the next day by Bank of America's $15 billion offering.
While the banks did not provide details on why they are raising the debt, analysts said a confluence of monetary and regulatory factors are driving the unprecedented cash grab, underscoring the increasingly tricky balancing act for Wall Street lenders as the economy emerges from the pandemic slump. 
That economic rebound driven by the vaccination roll-out and trillions of dollars of stimulus, combined with ultra-low interest rates, has made for excellent borrowing conditions on the heels of stellar first-quarter earnings.
After the U.S. Federal Reserve said in March that it would lift capital distribution curbs on banks that pass its June stress tests, many also want to have enough cash on hand to keep shareholders happy with increased stock buy backs.
""We are going to buy back a substantial amount ... as soon as we can,"" Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told analysts during the bank's earnings call prior to the bond sale.
On Monday, Goldman announced its own plans to buy back some preferred stock. 
GROWING DEPOSITS 
But it's not all good news. While the fire-hose of government stimulus gushing through the economy flattered bank earnings, it has also reduced loan growth and caused deposits to surge. In turn, banks have had to park those deposits with the Federal Reserve and in safe-haven assets such as U.S. Treasuries. 
""These deposits are growing like crazy, but loans are not and common equity is not, and that creates a serious problem for the banks,"" said Dick Bove, an analyst with Odeon Capital Group.
""I've never seen this happen before.""
For some banks, those problems are regulatory. As of April 1, banks had to resume holding extra capital against Treasuries and Fed deposits after the central bank ended temporary pandemic relief that had allowed lenders to exclude those assets from a key capital calculation.
That ""supplementary leverage ratio"" (SLR) is an extra safeguard introduced following the decade-ago financial crisis that requires big banks to hold cash against assets regardless of their risk. With surging deposits, some banks may be looking to raise debt to ensure they operate comfortably within the ratio. 
""It's quite likely that the debt issuance may have been partly driven by the expiration of the SLR relief,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist with TD Securities.
Executives with both Goldman and Bank of America told analysts on first-quarter earnings calls they still had room to operate before reaching the leverage ratio threshold.
Morgan Stanley's debt offering was not driven by regulatory constraints, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Fed declined to comment.
JPMorgan, for its part, issued the bonds in part to address regulatory constraints, according to one person familiar with the matter. On its earnings call, the bank's executives flagged that deposit growth had increased its leverage, prompting Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak to criticize the rules. 

""Raising capital against deposits and/or turning away deposits are unnatural actions for banks, and cannot be good for the system in the long run.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate doubled to 2.2% in March, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday, as the central bank signaled economic slack would likely be absorbed earlier than it had previously forecast.
Previously, the Bank of Canada had said it would be 2023 before inflation returned sustainably to its 2% target. On Tuesday, the central bank said it would happen in the second half of next year. In the meantime, inflation would temporarily breach its target, the bank said. 
Part of the March price bounce is due to a statistical effect caused by a sharp deceleration last year during the coronavirus pandemic, Statscan said.
The bank also held its key overnight interest rate at a record low 0.25% as expected.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the annual rate to rise to 2.3% in March, up from 1.1% in February. Energy prices gained 19.1% on a year-on-year basis, while inflation excluding gasoline and food rose 0.9% versus a year ago.
""The headline spike, as expected, is largely an energy story, but there are some signs that underlying pressures are starting to show up,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at the Royal Bank of Canada. 
""The Bank of Canada's core measures also moved higher on the month, with two of them very slightly above the Bank of Canada's midpoint 2% inflation target,"" Janzen said.
CPI common, which the central bank calls the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was 1.5%, slightly higher than the 1.4% forecast by analysts. 
CPI median rose to 2.1% from 2.0% in February, and CPI trim was 2.2% in March, up from a revised 2.0% in the previous month.
But Derek Holt, vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank, said the annual rate is not being driven solely by a statistical effect.
""This isn't just base effect-driven, it's pretty remarkable resilience in terms of underlying inflation pressures,"" he said.
The bank now expects Canada's economy will grow 6.5% in 2021, up from its January forecast of 4.0%, with real GDP growth of 3.7% in 2022, down from a previous forecast of 4.8%.

After the Bank of Canada announcement, the Canadian dollar strengthened 0.9% to 1.2499 to the greenback, or 80.01 U.S. cents, its biggest gain since last June.

Investing.com – The Canadian dollar USD/CAD strengthened against the greenback after some initial hiccups in Wednesday’s trade, boosted by the country’s central bank forecasting a better economy.
Bank of Canada kept the key interest rate unchanged at 0.25%.
The Bank said it expects economy to grow 6.5% in 2021, up from its January forecast of 4%, with real GDP growth of 3.7% in 2022, down from a previous forecast of 4.8%. It now sees U.S. economic growth this year at 7%, up from 5%.
The Bank said the economy still needs “extraordinary monetary policy support” and that it is committed to holding the policy interest rate lower “until economic slack is absorbed so that the 2% inflation target is sustainably achieved.""
Nonetheless, improving economic indicators are behind the bank’s decision to trim its federal government bond purchases that were aimed at reviving the economy.
Effective April 26, weekly net purchases of government of Canada bonds will be adjusted to a target of $3 billion, the central bank said.
Like what many in several markets have feared their central banks will do, it suggested rates could rise sooner than the previous forecast of sometime in 2023.
Canada's annual inflation rate doubled to 2.2% in March, in part due to a statistical difference caused by the sharp deceleration last year during the pandemic and because of rising energy prices, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
Over the next few months, inflation is expected to rise temporarily to around the top of the 1% to 3% inflation-control range, the central bank said.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2021 04:31AM ET</span>",UK unemployment falls again under government's jobs shield,"By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's unemployment rate unexpectedly fell for a second month in a row to 4.9% in the December-to-February period, most of which the country spent under a tight COVID-19 lockdown, official figures showed on Tuesday.
Economists polled by Reuters had largely forecast that the jobless rate - which has been held down by the government's huge jobs subsidies programme - would edge up to 5.1% from 5.0% in the three months to January. 
The ONS linked the fall to a large volume of men leaving the jobs market altogether. The so-called inactivity rate rose by 0.2 percentage points in the three months to February, echoing a rise during the first lockdown of last year.
There was another reminder of the precarious state of the labour market in figures from Britain's tax office which showed the number of employees on company payrolls fell by 56,000 between February and March, the first decline in four months.
That pushed up the total number of jobs lost since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic to 813,000 - more than half of which were held by people aged under 25, with hospitality-heavy London the hardest-hit region, the ONS said.
""If we don't act quickly, in particular by focusing our support on the long-term unemployed, then we are risking another lost generation,"" Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said.
Some 363,000 people are classed as long-term unemployed after having been out of work for a year or more but with a similar number in the six-to-12-month bracket, that figure could soon rise sharply.
Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% in 2020, a bigger slump than almost all its European peers, after it locked down later and for longer than many of them. 
But helped by the fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations, it is in the process of lifting its third lockdown while other countries in Europe have recently tightened their restrictions.
The ONS said there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality which reopened for outdoor business last week.
FURLOUGH TAPER 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak in March extended his furlough scheme - which pays the wages of around one in five employees - until the end of September although employers will have to start contributing towards some of its costs from July. 
Without the scheme, the jobless rate would be far higher - a year ago, Britain's budget forecasters said it could hit 10%. 
The Bank of England will be watching how many jobs are lost when it expires as it considers how long it needs to keep its huge economic stimulus programme in place.
Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said long-term unemployment, particularly among young people, might mean progress towards pre-pandemic levels in the labour market lags behind the wider economic recovery.
""Further action will be needed to support the labour market when the furlough scheme ends, including supporting businesses to recruit and retain staff through a temporary cut in employer national insurance contributions,"" he said.

Britain's headline measure of pay growth again rose strongly in the three months to February, up 4.5% in annual terms. 
But the ONS said the reading was skewed higher by a drop in the number of lower-paid and part-time jobs. After accounting for this, pay growth was much weaker at 2.5%, it estimated.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian housing starts rose 21.6% in March compared with the previous month, easily beating expectations and hitting a new record, data from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation showed on Monday.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate of housing starts rose to 335,200 units in March, well ahead of analyst expectations for 250,000 units, and a new high for all months on record. 
Much of the gain was on multiple urban starts, which jumped 33.8% to 222,358 units. Single-detached urban starts rose 3.6% to 78,615 units.
""The big acceleration came as weather was unseasonably warm in many parts of the country,"" Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Economics, said in a note.
Mendes added that new home construction will likely be a major contributor to overall GDP growth again in 2021, even as building activity cools off from the ""torrid pace"" of recent months.
Canada's average home selling price soared an eye-watering 31.6% year-over-year in March, hitting a new high as sales also climbed to a new all-time record, the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) said earlier this month.
A supply imbalance has been blamed for skyrocketing home prices through the pandemic, though new listings surged in March, which, coupled with strong starts, suggests a more balanced market could be coming.
""Red-hot demand for real estate propelled a record month for housing starts in March. While the market will need a long stretch of supply growth to have a meaningful effect on prices, the March numbers are a solid start,"" said Shelly Kaushik, an economist with BMO Capital Markets in a note.

Canada's ruling Liberals are set to unveil their first full budget in two years on Monday, with billions in pandemic supports as COVID-19 infections skyrocket, a national daycare plan and new taxes on luxury goods.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 07:10AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Fearing foreclosure crisis, U.S. watchdog cracks down on mortgage servicers","By Koh Gui Qing, Katanga Johnson and Chris Prentice
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer watchdog is scrutinizing mortgage servicers' compliance with pandemic relief programs amid concerns struggling homeowners are not getting the help they need to avoid foreclosures, or are being discriminated against, said a dozen people with knowledge of the regulatory effort.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) crackdown by its policy, supervision and enforcement divisions could result in stiff penalties for those mortgage servicers found to have hurt borrowers, the regulatory officials, lawyers and industry executives said.
In recent weeks, the agency has sent data requests to mortgage servicers, usually a company or a bank that processes mortgage repayments. It is seeking data on how they are handling mortgage holiday or ""forbearance"" programs and whether the temporary debt relief is likely to get borrowers back on their feet, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter, some of whom asked to remain anonymous because aspects of the discussions are private. 
The agency has also opened probes into a handful of mortgage servicers over their handling of forbearance requests, three other people with knowledge of the matter said. 
""We are very concerned and we're watching closely,"" said one of the people. ""Our supervision team is robustly asking for more data than ever from servicers."" 
The effort underscores the tougher stance the new Democratic leadership of the consumer watchdog is taking towards the financial industry as it executes President Joe Biden's priorities to help Americans recover from the pandemic, boost fair housing and address systemic racial injustice. 
""The CFPB is focused on protecting consumers financially harmed by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" a CFPB spokeswoman told Reuters. 
""Part of that work is using our supervisory authority to ensure mortgage servicers are treating borrowers fairly and meeting their responsibilities under federal law.""
'VERY CONCERNED'
To help Americans weather pandemic lockdowns, Congress last year gave many struggling homeowners the right to pause mortgage repayments and imposed a moratorium on foreclosures. Both safeguards have since been extended several times and are due to expire later this year. 
As of April 4, an estimated 2.3 million homeowners were in forbearance, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
Last year, as servicers battled a flood of forbearance requests, the CFPB cut firms slack, but it is now taking a much tougher stance as it aims to prevent a foreclosure crisis, the sources said. 
""It already has started drilling down in its examinations and investigations of firms' activities, and the pace will only increase,"" said Quyen Truong, partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan.
According to the six sources, the agency is examining a range of issues: how many and which borrowers are in forbearance; whether loan modifications will succeed in getting borrowers repaying; if servicers have been obstructing or delaying forbearance requests or granting only partial relief; and if some servicers have been discriminating against borrowers based on race or ethnicity, whether deliberately or inadvertently.
Home equity loan delinquencies rose 1.65 percentage points to 5.82% in the fourth quarter of 2020, the first rise since April 2020, the latest American Bankers Association data shows.
""We remain very concerned about a potential wave of borrowers seeking assistance after the emergency protections expire later this year, and we will use our regulatory, enforcement, and supervisory authorities to prevent avoidable foreclosures,"" said the CFPB spokeswoman. 
Pete Mills of the Mortgage Bankers Association pointed out that ""record numbers"" of Americans had so far exited forbearance without losing their homes and said he hoped the CFPB uses the data gathered from servicers ""to guide, rather than penalize, the industry"" on how to best help homeowners in forbearance. 
STAVING OFF A FORECLOSURE CRISIS 
The CFPB was created after the 2009 financial crisis to police the type of predatory lending that drove the sub-prime mortgage and subsequent foreclosure crisis, penalizing dozens of mortgage firms in its early years.
Former President Donald Trump's administration weakened the agency's enforcement and some protections, say consumer groups, but the pendulum has quickly swung back as the new leadership has moved https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-financial-regulators-analys/analysis-with-quick-fixes-bidens-agencies-reverse-trumps-wall-street-friendly-rules-idUSKBN2BZ16N to bolster fair lending protections.
This month the agency warned servicers to take ""all necessary steps"" to prevent a wave of foreclosures and rattled the mortgage industry by proposing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cfpb-mortgages/u-s-consumer-watchdog-proposes-lifeline-of-sorts-for-struggling-mortgage-borrowers-idUSKBN2BS1KG to bar foreclosures until next year. 
According to a January report, the CFPB found during 2020 examinations that some servicers gave customers ""incomplete or inaccurate information"" on their forbearance rights, delayed processing requests, or erroneously charge late payment fees.
The CFPB complaint website has hundreds of testimonies from borrowers detailing problems with, or issues resulting from, their forbearance plans.

One borrower, writing on the website last month after allegedly receiving misinformation on their plan, accused their provider of ""very bad faith and trickery.""

517,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 19, 2021 01:00AM ET</span>",China’s Old Growth Drivers are Here to Stay in Pandemic Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- After fueling its V-shaped recovery by boosting spending on housing and infrastructure, China appears in no rush to drop its investment-led growth model despite international calls for it to “rebalance” its economy.
First quarter data released Friday underlined just how reliant China remains on its current approach: investment spending rose 6% compared with a 4.2% increase in retail sales, based on two-year average growth rates to strip out base effects from last year’s coronavirus lockdowns.
The International Monetary Fund and others have long argued that China’s unusually heavy dependence on investment in infrastructure and property has led to an unbalanced economy. While it’s helped to fuel decades of rapid growth, critics say it’s also led to a reliance on debt -- which could spark a financial crisis -- and overcapacity in the economy, as has happened in the past in industries like steel and coal.
Raising the share of household consumption would help to “rebalance” the economy, the argument goes. At about 43% of gross domestic product, China has one of the highest investment ratios of any major economy, while consumption is about 38%.
Justin Yifu Lin, a former chief economist at the World Bank who was an adviser to President Xi Jinping last year, said in an interview that calls for consumption-led growth “are not supported by empirical evidence or economic theory.” He argues that high investment in new infrastructure and equipment enables workers to be more productive and raises their income, in turn increasing consumption.
“If I’m an ordinary person what I care about will be the growth rate of consumption. We’d like to have higher consumption, but not necessarily a higher consumption ratio,” he said. Any increase in China’s consumer spending share in the next five years “will be gradual,” he said.
Growth Sources
That message is echoed by the central bank. In a working paper last week, People’s Bank of China researchers led by Chen Hao wrote that “consumption has never been a source of growth” and that “we attach importance to investment.” They singled out the U.S. as a warning, arguing that excessive consumption and low savings fueled a large trade deficit and contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis.
The pandemic increased China’s gap between investment and consumption as Beijing aimed financial aid at companies to resume production, rather than handing cash to households. The U.S. Treasury said in a report last week that China’s lack of government support for households had fueled its rising trade surplus in 2020, calling on Beijing to “take decisive steps” to allocate more resources to consumers.
Lin says declining household consumption and an increased trade surplus are short-term effects of the pandemic and Beijing doesn’t need aggressive policies to counter them.
“Once the world returns to a normal situation I think the structure will spontaneously adjust back to the more balanced pattern,” he said.
In the longer term, because China is the leading producer of consumer goods but relies on other countries for raw materials it uses for investment, increasing the consumption share would not have a direct effect on the country’s trade surplus, Lin said. China’s current account surplus, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services, fell below 2% of GDP before the coronavirus pandemic, even as it maintained a high investment rate.
The share of consumer spending in China’s GDP will increase at a slower pace in the next few years and economic growth still needs the support of investment, said Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the China Association of Policy Science’s economic policy committee, a think tank affiliated with the ruling Communist Party’s Central Committee. There’s still a lack of infrastructure to support urbanization and an aging population, he added.
There are other indications that Beijing’s consumption push will be muted. The government’s latest five-year plan released last month predicts that the share of household income in GDP, the main determinant of consumer spending power, will remain roughly constant through to 2025. Beijing plans to invest the equivalent of trillions of dollars in digital infrastructure and green energy over the next five years.
‘Demand-Side Reforms’
Late last year, the Communist Party called for “demand-side reform,” a pledge that many interpreted as emphasizing policies aimed at creating a more equal distribution of household income. Since those with lower incomes tend to save less, re-distributive policies could increase consumption without raising the overall household income share.
Yet the five-year plan shifted language to “demand side management,” which is a “less ambitious formulation,” according to Andrew Batson, a China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics. Bejing has announced plans to increase consumption this year, but “none of these policy goals are associated with quantitative targets, or seem sizable enough to move the needle on aggregate consumer spending,” Batson wrote in a note. “The government does not actually have a plan to boost consumption.”
Some Chinese economists worry that investment spending is too low, rather than too high. Former central bank adviser Yu Yongding last week argued for a faster rate of increase in government infrastructure spending to boost growth, dismissing fears that added debt will increase financial risks.
“An inadequate economic growth rate will increase, rather than reduce, vulnerabilities of the financial environment,” he wrote in the state-run China Daily.

China exported $12.978 million of goods to North Korea in March, up from $3,000 in February and $33,000 in the first two months, according to Chinese customs data released on Sunday. 
The shipments in March were the highest by value since $18.882 million in September last year. 
China imported $1.308 million of North Korean goods in March compared with $1.75 million in February. 

Early last year, North Korea banned almost all cross-border travel, and some countries including Britain, France and Germany withdrew their local representatives.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2021 09:50PM ET</span>",Japan's exports post largest monthly gain since late 2017,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports posted their strongest growth in more than three years in March, led by a surge in China-bound shipments, in a sign the economic recovery from last year's deep coronavirus slump remains intact.
However, the trade data is unlikely to completely ease worries about the fragile recovery of the world's third-largest economy, which took an enormous hit from a collapse in global trade due to the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020.
Ministry of Finance data showed on Monday exports surged 16.1% in March from a year earlier, marking the steepest rise since November 2017. That was better than an 11.6% jump expected by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed a 4.5% contraction in February.
""The rebound in exports slowed significantly across Q1 and external demand is unlikely to provide much of a tailwind to growth this year,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""The impressive annual figure was down to base effects from the weakness in exports in March 2020.""
The exports surge was also marked by especially strong shipments to Japan's largest trading partner China, while the pace of recovery in firms' exports to the United States remained relatively slow, said analysts.
""Most exports to China aren't very high-tech, and there's the possibility there will be restrictions amid rising U.S.-China tensions,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Shipments to China, Japan's largest trading partner, soared 37.2% in the year to March, led by nonferrous metals and plastic materials, and also boosted by stronger exports of semiconductor machinery.
However, Japan's economy was likely to face headwinds from a slower recovery in U.S.-bound shipments, which tend to add more value than those exported to China and elsewhere in Asia, for at least another couple of months, he added.
Exports to the United States, the world's top economy, rose 4.9% to post their first year-on-year gain in five months, as strong demand for cars and construction machinery such as bulldozers offset lower shipments of aircrafts.
Shipments to Asia as a whole gained 22.4%, while those to the European Union advanced 12.8% in March.
Imports rose 5.7% in March compared with the same month a year earlier, versus the median estimate for a 4.7% increase, bringing a trade surplus of 663.7 billion yen ($6.11 billion) versus the median estimate for a 490.0 billion yen surplus.

The trade data follows the Reuters Tankan poll on Friday that found confidence among Japanese manufacturers rose to a more than two-year high in April as strong demand in the electronics market boosted prospects for exporters.

Asking prices jumped by 2.1% in the five weeks to April 10, only the second time in five years that prices have risen by more than 2% from one month to the next, Rightmove said.
The rise took the average price of property coming to market to an all-time high of 327,797 pounds ($451,737) and homes were selling in record-fast time, it said.
On March 3 Sunak said he would extend a temporary tax break for buyers and he also announced a new mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers who cannot afford large deposits.
The tax break was rushed out in 2020 to counter the economic hit from coronavirus. It helped to fuel a mini-boom in the housing market which was already seeing strong demand from people seeking more space after their first lockdown.
Other measures of British house prices have also shown a rise since Sunak's announcement.
Rightmove said its measure of available properties was at a record low.
""However some of the froth is likely to come off this spring surge later in the year as the challenging economic conditions come to the fore, some of the government support to individuals and businesses unwinds, and the stamp duty holidays finally end in England and Wales,"" it said. 
""Nevertheless we expect activity to remain robust for the rest of 2021.""

Planned payments stand at 97.4 billion euros, an increase of 5.5 billion euros ($6.59 billion) compared to previous estimate, the Finance Ministry said on Sunday.
Meanwhile, tax revenue is likely to come in 2.6 billion euros less than had been expected at 72.5 billion euros, boosting the forecast budget deficit by 8.1 billion euros to 30.7 billion euros.
Altogether, the general government debt ratio will rise 1.7 percentage points to 89.6% of gross domestic product, the government said.
""We're adjusting the budget to secure further resources for healthcare and economic aid,"" Finance Minister Gernot Bluemel said, adding the move follows budget revisions in neighbouring Germany and Switzerland. 
The action comes after Austria's Wifo institute, which provides forecasts for the government, said in March that in a ""lockdown scenario"" the country's GDP in the current year would grow only 1.5%, lower than an estimated 2.3% growth if lockdowns were lifted soon.
As it stands, Austria is planning broad easing in mid-May, but the government said that these budget changes were needed as the crisis persists. 
""I always said, if more money is needed, there will be more money,"" Bluemel said.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 12:35PM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts near 15-year high; consumer sentiment rises moderately,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. homebuilding surged to nearly a 15-year high in March, but soaring lumber prices amid supply constraints could limit builders' capacity to boost production and ease a shortage of homes that is threatening to slow housing market momentum. 
The sharp rebound reported by the Commerce Department on Friday added to robust retail sales in March in suggesting that the economy was roaring after a brief weather-related setback in February. Increasing COVID-19 vaccinations, warmer weather and massive fiscal stimulus are driving the economy, with growth this year expected to be the strongest in nearly four decades.
But caution is starting to creep in among consumers as the course of the pandemic remains uncertain and inflation is showing signs of heating up. Other data on Friday showed consumer sentiment rose moderately in early April.
""We're in a unique situation with the economy beginning to rebound from the worst of the pandemic,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Uncertainties remain, with many businesses yet to reopen, unemployment still high, and COVID-19 levels lower but persistent.""
Housing starts surged 19.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.739 million units last month, the highest level since June 2006. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.613 million units in March.
Starts soared 37.0% on a year-on-year basis in March. Homebuilding slumped in February as large parts of the country reeled from unseasonably cold weather, including winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely-populated South region.
Groundbreaking activity increased in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but fell in the West. Permits for future home building rose 2.7% to a rate of 1.766 million units last month, recouping only a fraction of February's 8.8% plunge. They jumped 30.2% compared to March 2020.
""While housing demand is expected to remain strong, we expect it to diminish somewhat as the year progresses,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. ""Homebuilders continue to face supply constraints, including increasing prices of lumber and other materials.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher, with the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting fresh record highs. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
RECORD LUMBER PRICES 
The housing market is being fueled by demand for bigger and more expensive accommodations, with millions of Americans continuing to work from home and remote schooling remaining in place as the pandemic enters its second year. Housing supply has been insufficient, with the inventory of previously-owned homes at record lows. This is underpinning homebuilding.
A survey from the National Association of Home Builders on Thursday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders increased in April amid strong buyer traffic. Builders appealed for solutions ""to increase the supply of building materials as the economy runs hot in 2021.""
Inflation concerns were on consumers' minds early this month. A separate report from the University of Michigan on Friday showed its preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to 86.5 from a final reading of 84.9 in March. 
Economists had forecast the index would rise to 89.6. 
The survey's one-year inflation expectation jumped to 3.7%, the highest level in nearly a decade, from 3.1% in March. Its five-year inflation outlook was unchanged at 2.7%.
Reports this month showed big increases in both consumer and producer prices in March as strong domestic demand pushed against supply constraints. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and many economists view higher inflation as transitory, with supply chains expected to adapt and become more efficient.
Supply disruptions because of coronavirus-related restrictions are driving up commodity prices. Softwood lumber, which is used for frames and trusses of houses, surged by a record 83.4% on a year-on-year basis in March, according to the latest producer price data published last week. Prices of other building materials such as plywood have also risen sharply.
Port congestion on the West Coast as well as winter weather in Canada that has shut mills and restricted truck shipping were also contributing to the shortages that were driving prices of building materials higher, according to an Institute for Supply Management survey published early this month.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, surged 15.3% to a rate of 1.238 million units in March. Still, starts remained below last December's peak, likely constrained by the more expensive building materials. 
Single-family building permits rose 4.6% to a rate of 1.199 million units.
""The failure of single-family starts to fully recover to last winter's peak level despite tight inventories in most metropolitan areas supports the idea builders are holding back,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment soared 30.8% to a pace of 501,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects fell 1.2% to a pace of 567,000 units.
Housing completions accelerated 16.6% to a rate of 1.580 million units last month, the highest since March 2007. Single-family home completions shot up 5.3% to a rate of 1.099 million, the highest since November 2007.

Realtors estimate that single-family housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap.
The stock of housing under construction rose 0.8% to a rate of 1.306 million units, the highest since September 2006.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",EU mulls more unified insolvency laws as wave of bankruptcies approaches,"By Jan Strupczewski
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers are discussing on Friday how to improve and possibly unify insolvency laws across the 19-nation bloc, to better prepare for a wave of bankruptcies expected when companies are weaned off government emergency pandemic support.
The expected surge in EU corporate bankruptcies will have a knock-on effect on the number of bad loans banks have to handle as the post-pandemic economic recovery starts to take hold and governments begin withdrawing state schemes that are now keeping many non-viable companies on life support.
But insolvency laws differ from country to country, making it more difficult for the euro zone to deal with the problem. The issue threatens to hamper economic growth as assets of insolvent companies are frozen during lengthy legal processes rather being quickly re-deployed in the economy.
""National insolvency regimes across the EU differ in their design and in their practical implementation,"" the European Commission said in a paper for the ministers' discussions.
""(They) embody choices made regarding the appropriate balance between creditor and debtor interests ... the priority enjoyed by employees, public utilities and tax authorities in the process,"" the paper said.
It said euro zone countries should, for instance, agree on a definition of insolvency and when a company should be obliged to undergo formal insolvency proceedings. 
It would also help if there was a common view on actions to replenish the insolvency estate in case of fraud, on asset tracing, the ranking of claims, including the position of secured creditors in insolvency and on court capacity, it said.
""The Commission will consider either proposing a legislative instrument for minimum harmonisation of certain targeted elements of corporate insolvency laws, or coming forward with a non-legislative initiative to increase convergence,"" it said.
Unifying these laws would involve justice ministries, adding an additional layer of difficulty, a senior euro zone official said. ""It may be realistic that we will have to look for non- legislative steps to promote convergence,"" the official said.

Such non-legislative steps would involve making sure that judicial systems in every country have proper resources and that backlogs of cases in courts are tolerable. Setting EU benchmarks to reach could help, the official said.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said EU imports from Britain dropped 47.0% year-on-year in January-February to 16.6 billion euros ($19.9 billion) while exports to the United Kingdom declined only 20.2% to 39.8 billion euros.
As a result, the EU's trade surplus with Britain rose to 23.2 billion euros in the first two months after Britain's Brexit transition period expired from 18.6 billion euros in the same period of 2020, when London still enjoyed unfettered access to the EU's single market.
Eurostat said the euro zone's unadjusted trade surplus with the rest of the world fell to 17.7 billion euros in February from 23.4 billion in February 2020. However, because of a strong January, the two-month cumulative result was still better than last year showing a surplus of 28.7 billion euros against 25.0 billion euros in Jan-Feb 2020.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone trade surplus with the rest of the world was 18.4 billion in February after 28.7 billion in January as exports fell 2.5% on the month while imports rose 3.4%.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 04:36AM ET</span>",China's GDP hits record growth but post-COVID recovery seen losing steam,"By Gabriel Crossley and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic recovery quickened sharply in the first quarter to record growth of 18.3% from last year's deep coronavirus slump, propelled by stronger demand at home and abroad and continued government support for smaller firms.
But the brisk expansion, heavily skewed by the plunge in activity a year earlier, is expected to moderate later this year as the government turns its attention to reining in financial risks in overheating parts of the economy.
While the jump in gross domestic product (GDP) undershot the 19% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, the official data showed it was the fastest growth since quarterly records began in 1992 and up from 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year.
""The upshot is that with the economy already above its pre-virus trend and policy support being withdrawn, China's post-COVID rebound is levelling off,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior china economist at Capital Economics. ""We expect quarter-on-quarter growth to remain modest during the rest of this year as the recent boom in construction and exports unwinds, pulling activity back towards trend.""
Aided by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the economy has recovered from a steep 6.8% slump in the first three months of 2020, when an outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan rapidly became a crippling pandemic that has killed about 3 million worldwide.
China's rebound has been led by exports as factories raced to fill overseas orders and more recently a steady pickup in consumption as shoppers returned to restaurants, malls and car dealerships.
Retail sales increased 34.2% year-on-year in March, beating a 28.0% gain expected by analysts and stronger than the 33.8% jump seen in the first two months of the year.
Other data, however, showed a moderation in expansion with quarter-on-quarter growth slowing to 0.6% in January-March from a revised 3.2% in the previous quarter, missing expectations for a 1.5% increase.
Factory output grew 14.1% year-on-year in March, slowing from a 35.1% surge in the January-February period and lagging a forecast 17.2% rise.
SLOWDOWN EXPECTED
National Bureau of Statistics spokeswoman Liu Aihua told a news conference on Friday while the economy started 2021 on a firm footing, the services sector and smaller firms still faced challenges, while consumer inflation was likely to remain moderate.
Data last week showed consumer prices rising at only a modest pace in March, even as factory gate inflation hit a near three-year high.
""Looking forward, the trend of normalisation may continue for the rest of the year, and domestic consumption is expected to be the major growth driver,"" said Chaoping Zhu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Shanghai.
""In terms of policy response, the central bank and fiscal authorities are returning to a more neutral stance, although some selective measures might be continued in order to support the small and medium-sized enterprises.""
Li Wei, economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) in Shanghai, expected second-quarter growth to slow to 7%.
FOCUS ON RISKS
The world's second-largest economy is expected to grow 8.6% in 2021, according to a Reuters poll, which would easily beat the government's 2021 annual growth target of above 6%.
China's GDP grew just 2.3% rise last year, its weakest expansion in 44 years but still making it the only major economy to avoid contraction as other industrial powers struggled with the pandemic hit.
With the economy back on a more solid footing, China's central bank is turning its focus to cooling credit growth to help contain financial risks.
However, it is treading cautiously to avoid derailing the recovery with policymakers vowing not to make any sudden policy shifts.
Authorities are especially concerned about financial risks involving the country's overheated property market and have asked banks to trim their loan books this year to guard against asset bubbles.

Separate data on Friday showed new home prices in China rising at the fastest pace in seven months in March, with gains spreading to more cities as red-hot demand defied government efforts to cool the market.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",Surge in illegal bank loan-funded China property buys worries regulators,"By Lusha Zhang and Ryan Woo
BEIJING (Reuters) - Property purchases in China funded through bank loans fraudulently obtained by speculators are fuelling already red-hot real estate markets in its biggest cities and beginning to alarm regulators.
Four tier-1 Chinese cities, including Shenzhen and Shanghai, have reported since March that a probe by financial regulators found that 877.8 million yuan ($134.21 million) of bank loans were improperly used for property purchases.
Analysts say that was just the tip of the iceberg and the number could be significantly higher nationwide.
""The amount (of misused loans) could be hundreds of billions of yuan in China's tier-1 and 2 cities,"" said Hong Hao, head of research at BOCOM International in Hong Kong, an estimate based on assumptions including 2020 transactions and loan volumes. 
The illegal diversion of bank funds presents a policy dilemma for Beijing, which wants to keep credit lines open to support businesses while ensuring loans are not misused. 
Home prices in large cities have soared since last year, fuelled by relentless speculation that Beijing has so far failed to suppress, and in many cases funded by business loans granted by banks.
Regulators are worried genuine credit demand may get crowded out by the illegal property loans. They have asked local governments for a report on such loans by May 31.
""In some red-hot cities with strong expectations of home price gains and high levels of speculation, there are cases in which people fraudulently obtain business loans from banks for home purchases, and some even involved organised criminal activity,"" Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the central bank, told a media briefing on Monday.
""If this can't be contained immediately, it will not only affect the effect of property regulatory policies, it will also squeeze out credit resources for the real economy, especially for smaller firms."" 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) and Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
WHISTLEBLOWER
Big Chinese cities have imposed onerous conditions on buying residential property, including requiring buyers to have residential permits for up to five years and to fork up at least 30% of the purchase price in cash. 
People, though, have come up with ways to try and circumvent them.
In an instance last year, an unidentified woman detailed her plan in an ad posted in some WeChat groups, seeking a joint investor among their over 3,000 members for a Shenzhen property purchase.
The so-called ""stakeholder"" would fund part of the 30% down-payment on a 7 million yuan apartment in the city, and they would jointly borrow the remaining 4.9 million yuan.
She would then use the home as collateral to apply for business loans via a shell company, and repay the 4.9 million yuan with the new bank loans, which carry lower interest rates compared to mortgage loans. 
The two would later resell the home at a higher price and repay all outstanding debt. She would get a 5% cut from the sale. 
The scheme was outlined in 102 screenshots of WeChat chat histories by an anonymous whistleblower on China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) last week. 
""I've been exposing their tactics for a while, and it's my third Weibo account as the previous ones were shut or suspended by the platform, but I knew it wasn't going to be easy,"" the whistleblower told Reuters.
Shenzhen authorities said last week they will investigate the WeChat groups described in the whistleblower's posts.

Investing.com – China’s economy soared in the first quarter on a yearly basis. Consumer spending also strengthened, suggesting a more balanced recovery on a quarterly basis from the investment and export-fueled rebound from 2020’s COVID-19-induced lockdowns.
Economic data released earlier in the day said that the GDP for the first quarter grew a record 18.3% year-on-year and 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in March. Both were lower than the 19% and the 1.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
Yearly growth soared from the 6.5% growth recorded in the first quarter of 2020, although the figures were skewed by the comparison with those from 2020, when China imposed a strict lockdown as the COVID-19 pandemic spread.
The country’s economic recovery has progressed at a remarkable speed, with the losses from a recorded contraction in the first quarter of 2020 all but recovered by the end of September 2020. Strong industrial output and robust exports as COVID-19 fueled demand for Chinese-made medical goods and electronic devices also gave the recovery a leg up.
“We are seeing a bit more balanced recovery in the Chinese economy,” UBS AG chief China economist Wang Tao told Bloomberg.
As monetary and fiscal policy starts to normalize, property and infrastructure investment are set to slow in the next few quarters, “that early pickup in the construction industry is going to give way to more household consumption,” she added.
Meanwhile, the quarterly growth, a better reading of the economy’s momentum, was slower than the 2.6% growth recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Wang credited the slower growth to a fresh COVID-19 outbreak at the beginning of 2021, the subsequent travel restrictions over the Lunar New Year holiday in February and a lack of additional fiscal stimulus.
However, policymakers are wary of the increasing pace of economic recovery indicated by stellar yearly growth in GDP, which is also leading to rising inflation and soaring debt levels. The government has signaled a scale back in fiscal and monetary stimulus and is also tightening regulatory oversight in lending and real estate among other sectors.
Meanwhile, the unemployment rate stood at 5.3%, slightly down from the previous reading of 5.5%."

The recovery in the world's third-largest economy has been led by improving output and exports, but slow vaccine rollouts and a renewed surge in COVID-19 cases are clouding the outlook for consumption.
Next week's key data includes core consumer inflation, which is expected to fall for the eight consecutive month as price pressures remained low due to weak consumer demand.
Exports likely rose 11.6% in March from a year earlier, which would mark the sharpest rise since January 2018, the poll of 16 economists showed.
Imports were forecast to have grown 4.7% in March from a year earlier, which would result in a trade surplus of 490.0 billion yen ($4.5 billion).
Japan's economy suffered greatly from a shakeout in global trade due to the pandemic in the first quarter of last year, when it entered a recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years.
""Exports are again expected to turn positive compared to a year earlier, as they started to decline greatly in March last year due to the impact of the coronavirus,"" said Kenta Maruyama, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
""While the rising trend that is driven by strong demand for capital and information-related goods continues, it is slowing down slightly.""
The finance ministry announces trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Monday (2350 GMT Sunday).
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is expected to have fallen 0.1% in March compared to the same month a year earlier, according to the Reuters poll.
The pace of decline, however, was expected to remain moderate as rising energy prices increasingly offset the downward pressure from lacklustre consumer spending due to the pandemic.
The government releases core CPI at 8:30 a.m. on Friday (2330 GMT Thursday).

Gross domestic product climbed a record 18.3% in the first quarter from a year earlier, largely in line with the 18.5% predicted in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The figures released by the statistics bureau Friday are skewed by comparisons from a year ago when the economy was in lockdown. A better reading of the economy’s momentum comes from quarter-on-quarter growth, which slowed to 0.6% from 2.6% in the previous three months.
China’s economy steadily picked up pace after an historic contraction in the first quarter of last year, recovering all its lost ground by the end of September. The rebound has been led by strong industrial output and robust exports as the pandemic fueled demand for Chinese-made medical goods and electronic devices.
Bumper GDP growth, rising inflation and soaring debt levels have put policy makers on guard. Beijing has signaled it wants to scale back fiscal and monetary stimulus now that the recovery is gathering pace, and is tightening regulatory oversight in areas such as lending and real estate. The central bank has asked banks to curtail loan growth in coming months, though officials have stressed a gradual tapering of policy.
Globally, the rollout of vaccines is helping to bolster the world economy and underpinning China’s growth. On top of that, the Biden administration’s massive fiscal stimulus is expected to have huge spillovers for the rest of the world, especially in China, the world’s biggest exporter. Bloomberg Economics’ Chang Shu upgraded her growth forecast for China for this year to 9.3% from 8.2% previously. The government’s official target is for growth above 6% this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose by the most in 10 months in March as Americans received additional pandemic relief checks from the government and increased COVID-19 vaccinations allowed broader economic re-engagement, cementing expectations for robust growth in the first quarter.
The brightening economic prospects were underscored by other data on Thursday showing first-time claims for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to the lowest level since March 2020, when mandatory closures of nonessential businesses were enforced to slow the spread of the first COVID-19 wave.
Though output at factories rebounded modestly last month amid a global semi-conductor chip shortage that is hurting automobile plants, manufacturing remains underpinned by the strong domestic demand. The upbeat data, which followed on the heels of recent reports showing inflation heating up, will likely not shift the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance.
""Demand is booming right now. Fed officials up to now have said they expect this boost in demand to be fleeting, and will not consider changes in policy until the labor market is at full employment and price levels increase at a sustained pace,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Their resolve will be tested in the next couple of months.""

Retail sales rebounded 9.8% last month, the largest increase since May 2020, the Commerce Department said. Data for February was revised higher to show sales dropping 2.7% instead of 3.0% as previously reported. March's rise pushed the level of sales 17.1% above its pre-pandemic level and to a record high.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would increase 5.9% in March. Retail sales surged a record 27.7% on a year-on-year basis.

The broad-based rebound was led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships accelerating 15.1%. Sales at clothing stores soared 18.3%. 
Consumers also boosted spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 13.4% jump in receipts. Still, sales at restaurants and bars are 1.8% lower compared to March 2020.

Receipts at electronics and appliance stores increased 10.5% and sales at furniture stores rose 5.9%. There were also hefty gains in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at building material stores vaulted 12.1%. Online retail sales increased 6.0%.
Many qualified households have received additional $1,400 checks, which were part of the massive stimulus package approved in early March. The package also extended a government-funded $300 weekly unemployment supplement through Sept. 6. 
At the same time, temperatures have warmed up and the public health situation has been rapidly improving, allowing more restaurants to offer dining services.
The data, together with upbeat earnings reports from several companies, propelled the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to record highs. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
BROAD STRENGTH
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rose 6.9% last month after a revised 3.4% decrease in February. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have declined 3.5% in February.
Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their first-quarter GDP growth estimate by 100 basis points to a 9.7% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. 
The Fed's ""Beige Book"" report on Wednesday, described economic activity as having ""accelerated to a moderate pace from late February to early April."" 
Growth is expected to top 7.0% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984. It would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
A second report from the Fed on Thursday showed output at factories increased 2.7% in March after dropping 3.7% in February. Though the rebound did not recoup all of February's decline, that was offset by surveys showing strong manufacturing activity in New York state and the mid-Atlantic region this month.
Manufacturers in the two regions were also upbeat about prospects over the next six months, especially new orders.
""We think that activity in the manufacturing sector will keep picking up over time,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Indeed, households have amassed about $1.9 trillion in excess savings. That, together with a recovering labor market, are expected to underpin consumer spending this year.

In a fifth report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 193,000 to a seasonally adjusted 576,000 for the week ended April 10, the lowest level since mid-March 2020. Economists had forecast 700,000 applications for the latest week.
Despite the huge drop, claims remain well above their pre-pandemic level. Part of the elevation in claims is because of fraud. The enhancement of the unemployment benefit programs, including the weekly subsidy, could also be encouraging some people to file for aid and others not to seek work.
Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.

""Although one cannot read too much into any one week's reading on jobless claims, the degree of the drop in initial filings, hints at a strong labor market in early April as Covid-related restrictions in various states were eased,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 

The economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months. Employment remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.

532,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2021 06:10PM ET</span>",Investors look for answers as Treasuries rally after strong economic data,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sharp drop in Treasury yields in the face of strong U.S. economic data is surprising market participants who expected the reflation-driven bond selloff of the first quarter to continue.
U.S. Treasury yields notched their biggest drop since Nov. 12 on Thursday, even as March retail sales data came in much better than expected and jobless claims fell.
Normally, strong data would bolster the case for economic recovery and inflation, diminishing the attractiveness of bonds and pushing yields higher.
All told, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury has fallen nearly 20 basis points in April, reversing some of the dramatic rise in February and March and boosting a rally in growth and technology shares that has helped send markets to fresh records. The 10-year yield fell to a one-month low of 1.528% on Thursday. 
""Certainly the move in Treasuries today was counter to expectations,"" said Justin Hoogendoorn, managing director at Piper Sandler. ""With the surge in retail sales of 9.8% in March, a selloff seemed inevitable.""
Investors gave a broad range of reasons for the move, including an unwind of bearish bets against Treasuries, safe-haven buying in the face of heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine and increased appetite for U.S. debt among foreign buyers. 
John Briggs, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets, believes some investors may have already factored in a powerful economic rebound, accounting for the climb in yields earlier in the year. 
“The market has generally priced in that the U.S. is accelerating more quickly than originally expected,” he said. “We’ve now gotten to a point where there’s some stability from the sell-off and you’re going to see some appetite coming back into the market.” 
Speculators trimmed their net bearish bets on U.S. 30-year Treasury bond futures in the week to April 6. Their net position on the U.S. 10-year notes flipped from a net short to a net long, the data showed.
""That is somewhat telling of how it's not necessarily economic data that is driving this ... It's more positioning and expected change in terms of buyer base,"" said Chuck Tomes, associate portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
Nomura macro and quant strategist Masanari Takada recently noted a ""course correction"" away from bear trades in the Treasury market.
""According to the estimates output by our team’s model, it seems likely that fundamentals-oriented global macro hedge funds have already closed out the entirety of their aggregate net short position in USTs, and may have swung to the net long side,"" Takada said in a note on Tuesday.
Rising tensions between the United States, Russia and China could also be bringing some buyers back into the Treasury market as a safe haven given the outsized rally in equities over the past six months, said Scott Kimball, co-head of U.S. fixed income at BMO.
“Geopolitical risks are mounting, the income gap between net savers and those living paycheck to paycheck are continuing to grow, and the fiscal stimulus has been too late or at least behind the curve,” he said. 
Some investors have also pointed to greater demand from foreign investors, including Japanese buyers. April 1 marked the start of a new fiscal year in Japan, ending a period of portfolio readjustment in which investors sold off Treasuries.
The previous move higher in rates at the beginning of the year is also likely attracting buyers enticed by higher returns, said Robert Sears, chief investment officer at Capital Generation Partners.

""In this yield-starved world, rates don’t have to go up that much for the trade to become appealing,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Foreign outflows in Treasuries hit their highest in more than two years in February, according to data from the U.S. Treasury released on Thursday, as investors sold government debt on expectations that yields would go higher as the economy emerged from the pandemic. 
On a transaction basis, foreign investors sold $65.46 billion in Treasuries in the month, the largest outflow since December 2018, compared with outflows of $49.13 billion the previous month. Investors have sold Treasuries in nine of the last 12 months.
Foreign holdings of Treasuries overall declined to $7.098 trillion in February, from $7.119 trillion the previous month. In January, foreign ownership of Treasuries gained the most in six months.
""A lot of investors may have been nervous about the move in rates and decided to sell on expectations that rates are moving higher,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist, at TD Securities in New York.
At the end of February, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields were at 1.456%, up from 1.077% at the beginning of the month.
An improving U.S. economy due in part to increased vaccinations pushed yields higher in February and prompted market expectations that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates earlier than what officials had suggested, which was not until at least 2024.
The Fed stuck to its guns and said no rate hike is forthcoming over the next few years. 
Japan led the slide in foreign holdings in February, with $1.258 trillion, from $1.276 trillion in January, which, analysts said, may have been related to the country's March fiscal year-end.
Japanese investors tend to sell U.S. assets and repatriate those proceeds back to their home country for balance sheet purposes, with the approaching fiscal-year end.
Japan remains the largest non-U.S. holder of U.S. government debt.
China, on the other hand, raised its holdings of U.S. government debt, with $1.1 trillion, from $1.09 trillion in January.
""There's a lot of cross-currents. The sell-off has a lot of strong sellers, but also attracted buyers, buying the dip,"" said TD's Goldberg. 
Data also showed foreign investors bought $13.99 billion in U.S. equities in February, from $11.868 billion in January. Foreigners have purchased U.S. stocks for 10 straight months.
U.S. corporate bonds had a net inflow of $14.49 billion, from $18.87 billion in January.

Overall, net foreign acquisitions of U.S. long-term and short-term securities, as well as banking flows, amounted to a net inflow of $72.6 billion in February, from a revised $105.8 billion in January.

Businesses owned by people of color were more likely to scale back their operations during the pandemic, according to the study released on Thursday. Black-owned businesses, in particular, struggled to access financing and were more prone to using personal savings or to borrow money from family and friends to stay afloat. 
""The COVID-19 pandemic has deeply impacted communities of color and small businesses of color, in many cases to a greater extent than their white counterparts,"" the researchers wrote in the report.
Businesses owned by Blacks and Hispanics were half as likely to be approved for non-emergency loans as white-owned businesses, even when they were all similarly rated as being low credit risk. Just 24% of Black business owners and 25% of Hispanic business owners with low credit risk received all of the financing they sought, compared to 48% of white business owners.
In fact, Black and Hispanic business owners with low credit risk were approved for credit at the same rate as white business owners deemed to be a medium or high credit risk, the study found. 
Black business owners were more likely than any other group to take a hit to their personal finances. Some 38% borrowed money from a friend or relative, 25% worked a second job during the crisis and 74% used their personal funds. 

The report is based on a survey conducted last September and October of nearly 10,000 businesses with fewer than 500 employees and another 4,500 non-employer firms.

Business inventories rose 0.5% after increasing 0.4% in January, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. February's gain was in line with economists' expectations. 
Inventories fell 2.4% on a year-on-year basis in February.
Retail inventories were unchanged in February as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a ‐0.3% decline in January.
Motor vehicle inventories decreased fell 2.6% as previously reported. Motor vehicle stocks are dwindling as a global semi-conductor shortage hampers auto production.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 1.2% as estimated last month. That followed a 0.2% gain in January. Inventory investment has contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters.
Growth estimates for the first quarter are as high as a 9.7% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% rate in the fourth quarter. Growth this year is expected to top 7.0% this year, which would be the fastest since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.6% in February. Stocks at manufacturers jumped 0.8%.

Business sales fell 1.9% in February after rising 4.5% in January. At February's sales pace, it would take 1.30 months for businesses to clear shelves, up from 1.27 months in January.

The new target is contained in the Treasury's annual Economic and Financial Document (DEF) which Mario Draghi's cabinet approved at a meeting on Thursday.
The new target for the fiscal gap incorporates the impact of a 40-billion-euro stimulus package which the cabinet signed off on at Thursday's meeting, the source said. Italy has not posted a double-digit deficit since the early 1990s.

The DEF contains multi-year targets for the GDP, the budget deficit, and public debt, which are expected to be officially announced shortly.

Investing.com -- U.S. shoppers wasted no time in spending their stimulus checks in March, embarking on their biggest spending spree in nearly a year. 
Retail sales rose 9.8% according to data released on Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, well ahead of the 5.9% rise expected and the biggest monthly increase since May last year.  The less volatile series of  core retail sales also rose sharply, by 8.4%. The numbers for February were also revised up for both series.
The strength in retail sales was broadly distributed across almost all sectors: Sporting goods sales were up 24% after falling 6.9% in February. while apparel sales were up 18%, motor vehicles and parts were up 18%, and building materials sales were up 12%. Only food and beverage, with a 0.7% gain, lagged the overall trend noticeably.
""The level of overall sales should remain robust in the coming months with households on track to spend a part of savings accumulated during the pandemic,"" said Christophe Barraud, chief economist and strategist at Market Securities, in a blog post. ""The large amount of excess savings accumulated since March 2020 (more than $1.750 trillion at the end of February 2021) could partly flood the economy from 2Q21.
Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, noted meanwhile that ""almost every retail group is now above pre-crisis levels. Even clothing where spending dropped more than 80% from February to April 2020.""
He pointed out that the only outlier was the restaurant and bar sector, where spending is still 4.8% below pre-pandemic levels.
News from the labor market front was also encouraging, as initial jobless claims fell much further than expected last week to only 576,000, their lowest level since the pandemic began. Analysts had expected a figure of 700,000 ahead of time.
Last week's initial claims number was revised up by 25,000 to 759,000. 
The jobless claims numbers have been uneven in recent weeks. However, the longer-term declining trend was clearly underlined as another 1.2 million people dropped off the Department of Labor's broadest measure of those claiming benefits under all unemployment-related programs. The overall number fell to 16.93 million in the week through March 27, from 18.17 million the previous week.  The narrower number of continuing claims under federal and state programs

LONDON (Reuters) -English diners rushed back to restaurants this week and online job adverts have returned to pre-pandemic levels as Britain's economy starts to reopen following the coronavirus pandemic, according to new figures on Thursday.
The slew of economic indicators published by the Office for National Statistics and the Bank of England also showed that British banks are preparing to increase mortgage lending to households by the most since before the 2008 financial crisis.
Non-essential shops reopened in England for the first time since January on Monday, and restaurants and pubs were allowed to serve customers outside.
While much of Europe is battling with a fresh wave of COVID cases, Britain - which suffered the continent's highest death toll from the disease - is opening up as earlier lockdown measures and a rapid vaccine roll-out have reduced cases.
British restaurant reservations for Monday jumped to 79% of their level on the same Monday in 2019, a year before the pandemic, the ONS said, based on figures from bookings website OpenTable.
Online job adverts recovered to pre-pandemic levels on April 8, as retailers, pubs and restaurants took on new staff, according to figures produced by recruitment firm Adzuna for the ONS.
""We're not back to normal yet but these are really promising signs,"" Adzuna co-founder Andrew Hunter said.
The International Monetary Fund expects Britain's economy to grow 5.3% this year as it recovers from a record 10% slump in 2020. But it is still likely to take until 2022 before output is back at pre-pandemic levels - a slower recovery than the United States or Japan.
Around 5.7 million employees - 17% of the total workforce - remained on furlough at the end of March, the ONS said, and economists think it is unlikely that all will have work when government support ends at the end of September.
Thursday's figures also showed a fall in a closely watched measure of consumer spending based on Bank of England 'CHAPS' data on credit and debit card payment processing.
This spending measure dropped to 83% of its pre-crisis level in the week to April 8 from 88% the week before, likely due to public holidays over Easter, the ONS said.
Separate figures published by the BoE on Thursday showed banks gearing up for more lending.

Lenders polled in March said they planned to increase the supply of mortgage lending by the most since the survey began in 2007, while unsecured lending such as overdrafts were seen expanding by the most since 2013.
While banks' intentions do not always match up with later lending, it points to further fuel for a boom in British house prices which started in the pandemic, aided by an extension of property purchase tax breaks in March's budget.

Between Oct. 1 and April 2 the value of external trade slumped to $15.78 billion from $20.36 billion in the same period a year earlier, the Global New Light of Myanmar reported.
""Myanmar witnessed a slump in exports and imports triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Both sea trade and border trade dropped amid the coronavirus impacts and political changes,"" said the newspaper, which has long been considered a mouthpiece of the military.
The military overthrew an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi two and a half months ago after the election commission rejected its complaints of fraud in a November vote swept by her party.
The return of military rule has triggered daily protests and strikes that have crippled the economy. More than 700 people have been killed in attempts by the security forces to suppress the demonstrations, an activist monitoring group says.
The newspaper, citing Commerce Ministry data, said exports were estimated at $7.8 billion in the October-April period, down more than $1.7 billion from the same period the previous year.
Imports were valued at $7.9 billion during the period, down $2.85 billion.
Myanmar mostly exports agricultural products, animal products, minerals, forest products, and finished industrial goods. Its main imports are capital goods, raw industrial materials and consumer goods.
The government is trying to reduce the trade deficit by screening luxury import items and boosting exports, the newspaper said.
Myanmar’s trade deficit was $1.3 billion in the 2019-2020 financial year, the newspaper said, citing the central statistics office.
It had targeted exports of $16 billion and imports of $18 billion for 2020-2021 under a National Planning Law, it said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), the country's largest lender, said growth in its home loan book this year should boost the company's mortgage profit in the order of 3%, Chief Executive Officer Matt Comyn said on Thursday.
Speaking at a twice-yearly parliamentary session with the country's top banks, Comyn said CBA expects to grow its $378 billion home loan book by about 5% this year with demand for mortgages buoyed by near-zero low interest rates.
A strong economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, fuelled by easy monetary policy, paired with a ""miraculous"" turnaround in the labour market, will likely push record house prices even higher, Comyn added.
Job creation in March outstripped expectations with unemployment falling to 5.6% from a recent peak of 7.5% in July, government data showed on Thursday.
""We're anticipating credit growth of about 5% over the course of the year,"" Comyn said. ""Our forecast for housing (price growth)... I suspect it's probably closer to 10% at this particular point in time.""
Asked whether a 5% increase in CBA's home loan book would lead to an equivalent rise in mortgage profit, Comyn said factors such as bad debt and price-based competition meant profit would be slightly lower. Pressed on whether that meant a 3% increase, Comyn said, ""It could be in that order.""
""We've also seen the highest level of refinancing, in the market, that I think we've ever seen,"" he said, adding that business lending growth, however, would be much lower. 
While official interest rates dropped to a record low of 0.1% last year, major banks protected profit margins by not passing on the cuts to the majority of customers with variable mortgages, and instead lowered rates on fixed-rate loans.
That dynamic continues to lead many customers to refinance mortgages to secure cheaper debt.
CBA - the biggest of Australia's Big Four banks by assets followed by  Westpac Banking  (NYSE:WBK) Corp, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - reported A$3.89 billion ($3 billion) in cash profit for the six months to Dec. 31, a 10% fall from the previous year.
Together, the four command the majority of the country's A$1.8 trillion housing loan market.

Westpac's CEO Peter King, who appeared in the afternoon, matched CBA's expectations for housing and credit growth, but declined to given any forecasts on the impact of that growth on profits.

Australia’s unemployment rate fell further in March as strengthening sentiment combined with record low interest rates to accelerate the economy’s recovery and further boost hiring.
The jobless rate dropped to 5.6% from 5.8% in February versus economists’ median estimate of 5.7%, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday in Sydney. Employment soared by 70,700 in March, double the expected 35,000 gain. The participation rate climbed to 66.3%, also exceeding economists forecast of 66.1%.
“Employment and hours worked in March 2021 were both higher than March 2020, up by 0.6% and 1.2%,” Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS, said in a statement. “The proportion of women employed was the highest it’s ever been.”
The Australian dollar jumped on the data before trading at 77.36 U.S. cents at 11:34 a.m. in Sydney.
The economy is booming Down Under with sentiment surging as cashed-up households are encouraged to spend and firms consider investing. That’s prompted increased hiring and Australians to resume job-hunting, swelling the labor force and further strengthening the economic outlook.
The Reserve Bank of Australia in February doubled its quantitative easing program to A$200 billion ($155 billion) and reiterated that it doesn’t expect to increase interest rates until 2024 at the earliest. Governor Philip Lowe, in a speech last month, said the economy could probably manage unemployment in the low 4s, or potentially even the 3s, before stoking inflation.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that business applications rose 3.4% to a seasonally adjusted 440,165 last month. The increase, however, recouped only a fraction of February's 13.0% tumble. The data is derived from business applications for tax identifications.

The increase in applications was in all industries, with the exception of retail, which recorded a 5.3% decline.
Increased vaccinations have allowed more parts of the economy to reopen. That, together with additional pandemic relief money from the government is boosting domestic demand.

With businesses such as restaurants, cinemas and hotels still closed in many countries, many households in developed countries have accumulated far greater savings than normal.
Whether households start spending these savings or sit on them in anticipation of financial challenges ahead is one of the biggest puzzles facing economists and policymakers as they try to figure out how fast economies will recover from the pandemic.
The OFCE think-tank approached the issue by comparing a scenario for major economies where households spend in 2022 a fifth of the extra savings they built up during 2020 and 2021 with a scenario in which they do not.
Under the first scenario, global economic growth was seen at 4.5% next year and under the second it came out at 4.0%, the OFCE said in an update of its global forecasts.
The U.S. economy was seen achieving growth next year of 5.9% under the first scenario and of 3.7% without the boost from savings being spent down.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, could see 5.5% growth next year under the first scenario and 4.1% under the second, while French growth would reach 6.0% and 4.3% respectively.

Britain could see growth of 5.0% with a savings drawdown or 3.2% without while Italy was seen at 5.5% and 3.9% respectively.

Britain's Office for National Statistics said the productivity impact of last year's economic collapse - the biggest in more than 300 years - differed from the 2008-09 financial crisis due to the types of jobs affected.
""Although there was substantial volatility during the year, this contrasts with a slow and steady decline in productivity during the 2008-09 economic downturn,"" the ONS said. 
Many workers in relatively low-paid retail and hospitality roles lost their jobs or were furloughed last year, while employees able to work from home were typically in higher-paid sectors which boost the productivity numbers.
During the 2008-09 recession, there was a greater loss of high-paid financial services jobs, exacerbating a longer-term slide in productivity growth which began before the crisis and persisted for years afterwards.
The ONS said productivity within the retail sector itself increased sharply during the second half of last year as businesses partly reopened and a shift to online shopping intensified. 
Online retail employs fewer staff compared with traditional stores, and those shops which did stay open - such as supermarkets - tended to be larger than average, both factors which boost measured productivity.
However, output per hour in the public sector was 13.0% lower in the final quarter of 2020 than a year before. The ONS said this reflected a sharp increase in COVID-related spending - such as on costly personal protective equipment and COVID testing programmes - while measured output fell slightly.

Output per hour for the whole economy in the final quarter of 2020 was 0.7% lower than a year earlier, a slightly smaller decline than an earlier flash estimate of a 1.1% decline.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly fell the most in about a year in February, government data showed, dashing hopes for a pick-up in capital expenditure needed for a private sector-led recovery from the coronavirus-induced slump.
Policymakers are counting on companies to spend their huge cash piles on investment in plant and equipment and wage hikes to help pull the world's third-largest economy out of deflation and stagnation.
Many companies however are reluctant to invest amid worries over a fourth wave of COVID-19 infections, although a gradual recovery is expected later this year as vaccinations become more accessible. 
The Cabinet Office data on Wednesday showed core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 8.5% in February from the previous month.
It was a second straight month of contraction and marked the fastest decline since April 2020. A Reuters poll of economists had predicted 2.8% growth, following a 4.5% drop in January.
""The sharp fall in machinery orders in February poses downside risks to our view that business investment continued to rise last quarter,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""However, the recovery in private investment should still gather pace again in the second half of the year as vaccines allow the economy to regain full health.""
By sector, manufacturers' orders declined 5.5% in February from the prior month, dragged down by computers, nuclear power motors and engines.
Orders from non-manufacturers also decreased 10.9%, led by electric meters, railway cars and farm equipment.
Many economist have forecast a contraction in economic growth in the first quarter as COVID restrictions hampered service-sector activity, such as hotels and restaurants, keeping companies from boosting investment.
The Cabinet Office cut its assessment on machinery orders to say a pick-up is stalling. Previously, orders were described as picking up.
Underscoring solid overseas demand, external orders, which are not counted as core machinery orders, jumped 76.2% month-on-month in February, helped by a big ticket item that gave a one-off boost, a Cabinet Office official said.
The value of external orders hit a record 1.8 trillion yen ($16.53 billion) under comparable data available since April 2005, he added.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and electric utilities, declined 7.1% in February, versus a 2.3% gain predicted by economists.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 01:25PM ET</span>","Analysis: U.S. money market funds, advocates, stake out positions as crackdown looms","By Pete Schroeder and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Market participants this week staked out their positions on how to fix systemic risks in the $4.9 trillion U.S. money market fund industry, in what is shaping up to be the first big fight for U.S. President Joe Biden's financial regulators. 
After taxpayers bailed them out for the second time in 12 years during the pandemic-induced turmoil in March 2020, money market funds - a key source of short-term corporate and municipal funding - are facing a regulatory reckoning which could potentially change the industry beyond all recognition.
Monday was the deadline for submitting feedback to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on ideas the Treasury Department floated in December on ways to boost money market fund resilience amid market stress. [L1N2KA2BD] 
The industry on Monday disputed that money market funds were to blame for last year's turmoil in short-term funding markets, citing its own analysis, while conceding some changes were warranted. Advocacy groups, meanwhile, called for major reforms. 
""Without fundamental repairs, disorder will happen again,"" wrote http://4atmuz3ab8k0glu2m35oem99-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Systemic-Risk-Council-Comment-Letter-File-No.-S7-01-21.pdf the Systemic Risk Council, a think tank comprising former regulators, warning the implicit government guarantee the sector now enjoyed would drive ""even bigger problems down the road."" 
The Investment Company Institute (ICI), which represents the asset management industry, cautioned against hasty changes and said policymakers ""should prioritize the examination of the activities and behavior of all market participants.""
An SEC spokeswoman did not immediately provide comment on the review.
Because money market funds invest in high-quality short-term debt instruments and offer daily redemptions, investors generally expect immediate liquidity with little price volatility, and are easily spooked when those expectations are not met during market stress, according to the Treasury. 
As the pandemic shut down the economy in March 2020, investors pulled more than $130 billion from institutional investor ""prime"" and tax-exempt money market funds, contributing to stress in the short-term funding markets, it said. 
To calm fleeing investors and stem a broader crisis, the Treasury and Federal Reserve launched emergency liquidity facilities to backstop the market. 
The panic was reminiscent of 2008, when a run on money market funds threatened to freeze up global markets and prompted the government to backstop the sector. 
That bailout led the SEC in 2010 and 2014 to introduce rules aimed at reducing the risk of investor runs. But last March showed those changes were inadequate, said regulatory experts.
Among the additional reforms floated by the Treasury were new liquidity and capital requirements, allowing fund boards more flexibility to charge for or suspend redemptions, and adjusting the fund's value in line with dealing activity to transfer costs to redeeming investors, known as ""swing pricing."" 
The ICI did endorse two measures: scrapping fixed thresholds for imposing redemption fees and suspensions, which it said intensified investor flight, and raising the proportion of a fund's weekly assets which must be liquid, currently 30%.
The group said the Treasury's other ideas, many of which were dismissed during the SEC's previous review, would not help improve financial system resilience.
Better Markets, a Washington-based advocacy group, however, warned policymakers not to again bow to industry resistance and to instead implement a combination of the Treasury's proposals. 

The group's legal director Stephen Hall said finishing the job of regulating the industry was ""long overdue"" and that he expected the SEC to issue proposed new rules soon.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's stubbornly high inflation is expected to heat up again in March, according to a Reuters poll of analysts, creating pressure for the government as it looks to rein in rising prices that stymie economic growth and increase poverty.
The poll of 16 local and foreign analysts indicated that the South American country's Consumer Price Index (CPI) would advance 4% in the month, quicker than the 3.6% rise a month earlier, driven mainly by food and education costs.
Argentina is expected to see 46% inflation this year, a recent central bank poll showed, well above government targets, though slightly lower than an earlier poll. Soaring prices were a key element in poverty hitting 42% last year.
Analysts are divided about whether a government drive to tamp down inflation will work. It is a key focus in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a new deal to roll over some $45 billion in loans Argentina cannot pay back.
Hernán Hirsch of FyE Consult said inflation was ""consolidating"" even with currency controls holding the exchange rate in check. 
Isaías Marini, an economist at Econviews consultancy, however, predicted the rise in prices would cool.
""In the coming months we project a slowdown in inflation, mainly due to the central bank's new strategy of reducing the rate of exchange rate depreciation, but also due to controls and the freezing of rates,"" he said.
Alberto Ramos at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) pointed out in a note that prices were rising around the region, driven by food and energy costs, and this would likely get worse before it got better.
""Rising inflation is no longer a risk but a tangible reality for a number of emerging markets, particularly in LatAm,"" he said.
Argentina's INDEC statistics agency is set to release official March CPI data on Thursday.

550,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>",Drifting apart? European firms battle to reach UK clients,"By Giulia Segreti and Simon Johnson
ROME/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Post-Brexit trade rules mean prosecco supplier Serena Wines 1881 must store bottles destined for Britain on costlier, fumigated pallets in their own corner of its warehouse in the northeast Italian town of Conegliano.
The new shipment requirement is one example of the extra cost and complexity that firms across continental Europe face serving British customers since Jan. 1, adding to disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic to drive UK-EU trade volumes lower.
""These first months have been hectic, hellish for everyone,"" said export manager Nicola Piovesana. ""Delivery times are now longer, now it takes 2 weeks to get to the (UK) client, while before it took one week at the most.""
The Dec. 24 deal reached between Britain and the EU after years of wrangling over post-Brexit trade terms at least meant goods trade - roughly half the total $900 billion of annual EU-UK commerce - was spared from tariffs and quotas.
But January trade volumes crashed as difficulties with the new rules combined with a hit from pandemic restrictions and substantial stockpiling by firms on both sides of the English channel in late-2020 in anticipation of trouble.
UK data released on Tuesday showed only a partial recovery in February, with British goods exports to the EU 12.5% below year-ago levels and imports 11.5% down. Data from Italy, France and Germany - Britain's biggest EU trading partner - have all shown falls in the volume of UK trade in February.
With Britain its second largest export market after Germany, Serena Wines has bent over backwards to secure business with UK hotels, restaurants and caterers by revamping internal customs processes and dedicating one staff member to Britain alone.
But the pallet issue is typical of the type of knock-on impacts that companies are now having to deal with: in this case, trade with any non-EU country means international rules on anti-pest treatment of wood packaging apply. 
Piovesana says the fumigated pallets cost about 9.50 euros (8.23 sterling) each, almost 20% more than the regular ones. UK guidance is for firms to consider switching from wooden to plastic pallets.
""EASIER TO SHIP TO ASIA""
High Quality Foods, a Rome-based food supplier to high-end outlets from artisanal bakers to West End eateries, struggles most with documentation on speciality meat products like beef from Black Angus cattle crossed with an Italian breed.
""There seems to be a trap in every corner,"" lamented managing director Simone Cozzi, adding the company's hygiene officer - a trained veterinarian – now needed to spend extra time with them when filling in the necessary paperwork. 
Cozzi said delays at customs points had also added to transport costs because drivers want more money to compensate for wasted time, while air shipments can be held in a UK airport for 24-plus hours compared to only 30-45 minutes in Hong Kong.
""At the moment it is actually easier to ship things to Asia,"" he said.
Italian farmers association Coldiretti cites such hurdles as endangering 3.4 billion euros of Italian agri-food exports, pointing to a 38% drop in exports of foodstuffs to the UK in January and almost 14% in February. 
Some firms have found work-arounds - albeit at a cost.
Swedish wood products supplier Vida Wood, riding the wave of lockdown-induced booms in DIY home improvement activity, had an existing UK subsidiary which now takes care of all the customs hassle and bills the British end-customer from there.
""So there is more administration for us,"" said CEO Karl-Johan Löwenadler, acknowledging that solution would not be available to smaller companies with no UK presence like its 11-person operation in Billericay, 25 miles (40 km) east of London.
MORE CHECKS TO COME
While stories of major disruption are common among goods exporters across different sectors in Europe, the unanswered question remains what the long-term impact on trade will be.
A UK government spokesperson said the February data showed ""welcome growth"" in the value of trade with the EU from January, suggesting most traders and hauliers were now adapting.
""It's premature to make any firm judgments on the long-term impacts of our new trading relationship with the EU, especially with the pandemic still ongoing,"" the spokesperson added. (Graphic: Imports into the UK, https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU/dgkplyxgnvb/chart.png) (Graphic: UK exports, https://graphics.reuters.com/BRITAIN-EU/gjnpwdwywvw/chart.png) 
The Bank of England expects UK-EU trade in goods and services to fall by more than 10% in the long term due to post-Brexit restrictions, and for British output to be around 3% lower than if the government had agreed to the EU rules needed for a frictionless trade deal.
Moreover, exporters to Britain face added complications in the coming months, with extra paperwork for UK food imports such as meat, fish and cheese needed from October and a further raft of checks to take effect from January 2022.
A group of lawmakers and heads of business will hold a first ""evidence session"" on Brexit's trade impact on Thursday with a view to making recommendations on possible improvements.
Yet even before Brexit, the EU's share of Britain's trade had already been declining for years, with figures quoted in a UK parliament report last year showing UK exports to the EU made up 43% of all its exports in 2019, down from 54% in 2006.
Some major European exporters are resigned to the idea that, while the early disruption will eventually settle down, the logic of a Brexit deal that spurned closer ties will inevitably lead to a further drift southwards of UK-EU trade volumes.
It could already be happening: A December 2020 survey of members of Germany's BGA trade association showed one out of five companies were reorganizing supply chains to swap out British suppliers in favour of those in the EU single market.

551,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 03:11AM ET</span>","China's robust exports, surging imports boost economic recovery; outlook challenging","By Gabriel Crossley and Stella Qiu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rose sharply in March while imports growth surged to the highest in four years in yet another boost to the nation's economic recovery, signalling improving global demand amid progress in worldwide COVID-19 vaccination. 
The data suggests the world's second largest economy will continue to gather momentum as it emerges from the COVID-19-led slump in early 2020, though a lagging consumer rebound, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in many countries and Sino-U.S. tensions have raised risks for the outlook. 
Exports in dollar terms soared 30.6% in March from a year earlier, but at a slower pace from a record 154.9% growth in February. The analysts polled by Reuters have forecast a 35.5% jump in shipments. 
""Strong foreign demand is likely to be sustained throughout the second quarter as the global economy further recovers,"" said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust.
""But with the acceleration in global vaccination efforts, industrial sectors in other countries are gradually restarting. It remains to be seen that if China's stellar export growth will begin to slide.""
Despite sporadic COVID-19 cases in China's border cities, authorities have been able to largely contain the virus in a boost to the lagging consumer recovery. 
Beijing managed to largely bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control much earlier than many countries thanks to stringent anti-virus curbs and lockdowns at the initial phase of the outbreak last year.
Asian stocks markets were broadly positive after the data, with strong imports giving investors confidence that domestic demand is improving as part of the recovery from the pandemic.
The data showed total Chinese imports jumped 38.1% year-on-year last month, the fastest pace since February 2017 on high commodity prices, beating a 23.3% forecast and compared with 17.3% growth in February.
Meat imports of 1.02 million tonnes in March marked the highest monthly volume since at least January 2020, while imports for soybeans iron ore, copper and crude oil also rose.
China posted a trade surplus of $13.8 billion last month, versus analysts expectations for the surplus to rise to $52.05 billion from $37.88 billion in February.
TRADE CHALLENGES
Official and private manufacturing surveys in China pointed to robust growth, with export orders returning to growth amid improving foreign demand.
However, many analysts believe exports could lose some momentum in the short term and the advantages of orders transferred from other countries due to coronavirus-related disruptions will begin to abate.
Li Kuiwen, customs spokesman, said that overall trade growth in the second quarter could show the pace slowing due to a higher base comparison in the year-ago period when a jump in pent-up demand boosted the headline figures.
The resurgent COVID-19 infections abroad and constraints in global trade have left some companies grappling with prolonged delivery timeframes and surging prices of raw materials.
Makers of cars and electronic devices from televisions to smartphones are sounding alarm bells about a global shortage of chips, which is causing manufacturing delays as consumer demand bounces back from the coronavirus crisis.
Meng Xianglong, founder of Heji Trade & Credit Research Centre based in the port city of Ningbo, believes the recent surging commodity prices have already deterred some exporters from taking on orders, especially those small firms, in signs of the weaknesses to come for the next couple of months. 
""Factories are now facing a squeeze in profits. Even though today's data are robust, they're suffering from pains in reality.""
China's gross domestic product expanded 2.3% last year, the only major economy to post growth in 2020, underpinned by solid demand for goods such as medical and work-from-home equipment.
Still, the massive initial hit from the COVID-19 crisis meant China's growth in 2020 was still its weakest in 44 years.
This year, China has set a modest growth target of at least 6%, as authorities plotted a careful course out of a year disrupted by COVID-19 and amid heightened tensions with the United States.
President Joe Biden said last month that U.S. was not seeking confrontation with China over differences on trade. 

China's trade surplus with the United States slipped to $21.37 billion in March from a $23.01 billion in February.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's economy grew by 0.4% in February from January as companies prepared for the lifting of a third coronavirus lockdown, according to official data which also showed a partial recovery in post-Brexit trade with the European Union.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 0.6%. However, the data also showed that the fall in gross domestic product in January was not as severe as previously estimated, down by 2.2% compared with the initial reading of a 2.9% drop.
Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% last year, its biggest slump in more than three centuries and a more severe fall than in most European economies, as the country was battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Tuesday's data showed GDP remained 7.8% below its level a year earlier, shortly before the pandemic swept Europe, and was 3.1% lower than its level in October, before the two latest lockdowns hammered Britain's huge services sector.
Still, a fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has raised the prospect of a bounce-back this year and in 2022.
Non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality venues reopened on Monday and Prime Minister Boris Johnson hopes to relax most coronavirus restrictions before the end of June.
""While the UK is still on course for a modest contraction in GDP in the first quarter, investors are increasingly looking towards the forthcoming rebound in economic growth rather than dwelling on the negative quarterly figure,"" Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said. 
Growth in February was helped by a first rise in factory output since November, led by car manufacturing after two months of contraction when the industry struggled with a global shortage of microchips.
Wholesalers and retailers saw a pick-up in sales which helped the services sector to grow by 0.2%.
There were signs that trade between Britain and the European Union partially recovered in February after a hit in January, the first month of a new post-Brexit trade relationship.
British goods exports to the EU, excluding non-monetary gold and precious metals, were 41.4% below year-ago levels in January but partially recovered to be 12.5% below year-ago levels in February. Imports, which dropped 19.2% on year-ago levels in January, were 11.5% below year-ago levels in February.
Trade volumes between Britain and the European Union rose in late 2020 as businesses stockpiled goods in anticipation of border delays in 2021. 

""Despite the evidence of partial recovery from the substantial January falls in some commodities, it is still too soon to determine to what extent the monthly changes in trade for January and February can be directly attributed to the end of the transition period,"" the ONS said.

554,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 13, 2021 12:40AM ET</span>","Chinese Trade Remains Strong, but Exports Miss Forecasts","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Chinese exports rose at a slower pace than expected in March despite strengthening global demand, while imports grew at a faster pace, according to data released earlier in the day.
Exports grew 49% year-on-year, higher than the 35.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but remaining below February’s 60.6% growth.
Although growth slowed from February’s record gains, export momentum remained strong as COVID-19 vaccines continued to be rolled out globally and a recovery in global growth, albeit uneven, helped boost demand.
“Export outperformance remains a theme in China’s recovery,” Natwest Markets economist Peiqian Liu told Bloomberg, adding that it was due to “a combination of global recovering demand as well as China’s role in filling up the global supply chain gaps.”
Meanwhille, Imports grew 38.1% year-on-year, higher than both the 23.3% growth in Inveting.com forecasts and February’s 22.2% growth.
The surge in imports was due to higher volumes and prices of commodities, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. senior China strategist Xing Zhaopeng told Bloomberg.
“Looking forward, while rising commodity prices may increase import costs in the near term, the recovery in external demand could offset part of the impact,” he said.
The trade balance stood at USD116.35 billion, against the forecast USD52.05 billion and the USD103.25 billion recorded in February.
Although the Chinese Ministry of Commerce did not provide a forecast for the country’s foreign trade outlook, it has pledged to push for stable development in foreign trade in 2021. The World Trade Organization, meanwhile, forecast that global trade would increase by 8% in 2021, the biggest gain since 2010, after falling 5.3% in 2020.
The comparison with figures from early 2020, when China entered a COVID-19-induced strict lockdown that shut down much of its economy, also distorted the figures. The distortion led Premier Li Keqiang to urge investors and companies over the weekend to look beyond the ‘base effect’ and use other data and methods to assess the economic situation."

China is benefiting from stronger global demand as the rollout of vaccines helps to boost world growth. The figures are also skewed by comparisons from a year ago, when the economy was largely shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

556,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 03:50PM ET</span>",Middling U.S. Treasury auctions mean lull in yields continues for now,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Demand for the $96 billion in new Treasury notes sold Monday was average, but substantial enough to prevent a jump higher in yields ahead of Tuesday's inflation data. 
The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday sold $58 billion in three-year notes to solid demand, while the results of the $38 billion 10-year note auction were slightly weaker. Both were watched closely by investors looking to see if the auctions would restart the dramatic rise in yields of the first quarter. [US/]
The flood of new Treasury supply - estimated to be around $4 trillion this year to pay for pandemic stimulus endeavors - has contributed to the move higher in yields this year. Historically weak auctions, in particular February's seven-year offering, were responsible for sparking dramatic selloffs in Treasury debt that pushed yields to pre-pandemic highs. 
The stabilization in yields that began in April will therefore continue going into the publication of consumer price index data on Tuesday morning. 
""The three-year was good, the 10-year was okay,"" said Andy Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. 
""I don't think it's going to have much of an effect on rates just on this alone. I still think the jury is out as to what the next big move is,"" said Brenner, who does believe the rise in yields will resume, and expects the 10-year yield to reach 2% before the end of the second quarter. 
The benchmark 10-year yield rose more than 80 basis points in the first quarter. Since the start of the second quarter on April 1, the 10-year yield has dropped 6.8 basis points and was last trading around 1.678%.
U.S. consumer price data for March, due Tuesday, might also drive yields higher. Yields on longer-dated securities rise with inflation expectations, as higher consumer prices can erode their value over time. U.S. producer prices notched their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years last month, Labor Department data showed Friday, likely marking the start of higher inflation as the economy reopens.
In order for yields to move significantly higher, ""I think you would have to have a CPI number tomorrow out of line, outside of expectations, similar to what the PPI was on Friday,"" said Brenner.

The Treasury will also be auctioning $24 billion of 30-year bonds on Tuesday and a total of $151 billion in bills throughout the week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. government posted a March budget deficit of $660 billion, a record high for the month, as direct payments to Americans under President Joe Biden's stimulus package were distributed, the Treasury Department said on Monday.
The deficit for the first six months of the 2021 fiscal year ballooned to a record $1.706 trillion, compared to a $743 billion deficit for the comparable year-earlier period.
The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a big impact on the first six months of fiscal 2020, as increased outlays tied to rising unemployment due to pandemic-related lockdowns and major new aid spending did not start until the very end of March 2020 and ramped up in the following month, a Treasury official told reporters. 
The March 2021 deficit was the third highest U.S. monthly deficit on record, surpassed by gaps of $864 billion in June 2020 and $738 billion in April 2020.
The March deficit, which compared to a year-earlier fiscal gap of $119 billion, included receipts of $268 billion and outlays of $927 billion - both record highs for that month.
The 13% increase in March receipts was buoyed by an increase in taxes withheld from individuals, representing strong earnings among higher-paid Americans who were able to work remotely, the Treasury official said, as well as from improved overall employment levels compared to a major drop in employment in the second half of March 2020.
The March outlays were further increased by $339 billion in direct payments of $1,400 that were sent to many individuals under Biden's American Rescue Plan Act that was enacted last month, the Treasury official said.

More funding from the $1.9 trillion stimulus package will roll out in coming months, the official added, likely keeping outlays elevated.
For the first six months of fiscal 2021, outlays were a record $3.410 trillion, while receipts were $1.704 trillion, the Treasury said. Total direct payments in the six-month period came to $487 billion, including those from a year-end stimulus package passed under former President Donald Trump, the Treasury official said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union cannot help EU-hopeful Montenegro repay its debts to China, but can help it complete a highway plan that started with a huge loan from Beijing, the European Commission said on Monday.
The small Balkan republic will struggle this year to start servicing a 1 billion euro loan from China that it took in 2014 to build the first phase of the highway linking the port of Bar on Montenegro’s Adriatic coast to landlocked neighbour Serbia. 
Montenegro's Deputy Prime Minister Dritan Abazović said in March the EU should therefore help the country refinance the loan, taken out by the previous Montenegro government, to protect the EU candidate from becoming dependent on China.
Asked about the call for help, a Commission spokeswoman said that every country was free to make its own investment decisions but that the ""EU did not repay loans from third parties.""
Montenegro will have to find its own way to handle the Chinese loan, spent on a 44 km stretch of the 165 km motorway, the spokeswoman said, but the EU was willing to help with money for the rest of the road through its 9 billion euro Economic and Investment Plan for the Western Balkans.
""We are providing a mix of grants, guarantees and preferential loans from international financing institutions such as European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,"" she said, noting the financing was at ""very favourable conditions"".
Montenegro, with a population of 622,000, had a debt of 4.33 billion euros or 103 percent of GDP last year and its repayment ability has been weakened by the COVID-19 pandemic which is undermining its main source of income -- tourism.
The motorway is at the heart of an intense debate about Chinese influence in Europe, both within EU member states and countries aspiring to join the bloc such as Montenegro and its Western Balkan neighbours Serbia, Macedonia and Albania.
As Beijing extends its economic reach under the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, poor countries across Asia and Africa have seized on attractive Chinese loans and the promise of transformative infrastructure projects.
The Commission said Chinese influence was a concern.

""The EU has concerns over the socioeconomic and financial effects some of China’s investments can have. There is the risk of macro-economic imbalances and debt-dependency,"" the spokeswoman said.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 03:25AM ET</span>","Japan wholesale prices rise for first time in more than a year, stoked by commodities surge","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese wholesale prices marked their first annual increase in more than a year in March, a sign that rising commodities costs are pinching corporate margins and adding inflationary pressure to the world's third-largest economy.
Japan's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price firms charge each other for their goods and services, rose 1.0% in March from a year earlier, Bank of Japan (BOJ) data showed on Monday, marking the first rise in 13 months.
Markets are turning their attention to the return of inflation as advanced economies recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, forcing some central banks to offer reassurances that a brief uptick in prices won't trigger a withdrawal of stimulus.
Analysts, however, expect the fallout on consumer inflation to remain more modest in Japan than in the United States, as soft wage growth and slow vaccines rollouts are seen weighing on Japan's household spending.
The March jump in wholesale prices, which was at the fastest pace since January 2020, exceeded a median market forecast for a 0.5% increase and followed a 0.6% fall in February.
""While there's still a lot of uncertainty on the outlook, global economic activity is picking up and keeping commodities prices high,"" said Kouta Fujiwara, an economist at NLI Research Institute.
""Given the base effect of last year's sharp fall, Japan's wholesale inflation may spike to around 3% from April,"" he said.
Most of the gain in March wholesale prices was driven by a 29% spike in prices of non-ferrous metals goods and 9.8% rise in those for oil products and coal, showing how a rebound in global demand for commodities pushed up costs for Japanese firms.
Compared with a month ago, wholesale prices jumped 0.8% in March to mark the biggest gain since October 2019.
""The increase is driven mostly by recoveries in U.S. and Chinese economies, which are pushing up global commodities prices, rather than a rebound in domestic demand,"" said Shigeru Shimizu, the head of a BOJ division overseeing price moves.
""It's too early to say price levels have fully returned to pre-pandemic levels,"" he told a briefing.
The data will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price forecasts at its next interest rate review on April 26-27.
Japan's economy has emerged from the initial hit of the pandemic thanks to robust exports. But analysts expect any recovery to remain modest with a renewed spike in infections clouding the outlook for domestic demand.

Years of heavy money printing by the BOJ has failed to push inflation up closer to its 2% target, with core consumer prices falling 0.4% in February from a year earlier.
While rising input costs could help push up consumer inflation, they could also hurt retailers already feeling the pinch from slumping sales blamed on the pandemic.

560,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 02:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Big U.S. Treasury auctions could restart rise in yields,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury auctions offering $271 billion of new debt and a key inflation report this week could end a recent lull in the bond market, reigniting a rise in yields that worried investors in the first quarter. 
Treasury yields have dipped since April 1 during a two-week pause in issuance, reversing some of the dramatic rise in February and March. That eased concerns that higher borrowing costs will hurt stocks, particularly in growth sectors like technology, which have an outsized weighting in the benchmark S&P 500 index. 
Investors said weak demand at upcoming auctions, which kick off on Monday, could send bond prices lower and yields higher, albeit at a slower pace than in the first quarter.
""No matter how you slice it, supply auctions will be in focus,"" said Justin Lederer, Treasury analyst and trader at Cantor Fitzgerald. Of particular interest will be the auction of both three- and 10-year notes on Monday, worth $96 billion in total. 
The benchmark 10-year yield rose more than 80 basis points in the first quarter on expectations of blistering economic growth, higher inflation and the estimated $4 trillion in new debt to be issued this year. 
A poor seven-year note auction in February sparked a run higher in yields, and drove the 10-year real rate - the 10-year Treasury yield stripped of inflation expectations - to the highest since June 2020. Even after markets cooled slightly in March, demand at that month's seven-year auction was modest. 
Monday’s double auction ""will have some ramifications, but I don't think we move substantially the way we saw in quarter one,"" said Lederer. 
The Treasury will also be auctioning $24 billion of 30-year bonds on Tuesday and a total of $151 billion in bills throughout the week. 
U.S. consumer price data for March, due Tuesday, might also drive yields higher. Longer-dated yields rise with inflation expectations, as higher consumer prices can erode their value over time. 
.S. producer prices notched their largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years last month, Labor Department data showed Friday, likely marking the start of higher inflation as the economy reopens amid an improved public health environment and massive government aid.
""The next potential catalyst I see for the rates market is the CPI print,” said Eric Winograd, senior economist for fixed income at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). “It shouldn’t be a surprise, but you might still get some sticker shock and a bit of indigestion.” 
While the most recent Fed projections see inflation reaching 2.4% this year, well above target, the central bank believes it will fall back to 2% next year. The consumer price index, which does not map perfectly onto the Fed's metric, is expected to have risen 2.5% year-over-year in March, according to a Reuters survey. 
Some investors and strategists said there may be greater demand for Treasuries now than during March, which could cap any rise in rates. April 1 marked the start of a new fiscal year in Japan, ending a period of portfolio readjustment in which investors sold off Treasuries, said Meghan Swiber, U.S. rates strategist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). ""Japanese real money accounts were notably absent in March, likely because the combination of volatile rates and a stronger dollar kept a lot of buyers on the sidelines ahead of their fiscal year-end on March 31,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. 

""Now, with those buyers back in and currency markets a bit more stable, the balance has tipped slightly in favor of demand.""

(Reuters) - Ecuadorean banker Guillermo Lasso unexpectedly won the nation's presidency on promises to revive an economy battered by coronavirus as his rival's vows of a return to socialist largesse failed to win over a skeptical electorate. 
Lasso took 52% of the vote in the runoff following a campaign that pitted free market economics against the social welfare plans of economist Andres Arauz, a win likely helped by a ballot spoiling campaign that left one in six ballots void. 
The 65-year-old president-elect will now have to find ways to kick-start a stalled economy while using the same pro-market play book as President Lenin Moreno, who shored up government finances but struggled to create jobs and did not seek re-election.
""A third of Ecuadoreans live in poverty, and just three in 10 have access to employment,"" Lasso said at a campaign rally last week. ""These are two objectives that should bring 100% of Ecuadorean political leaders to dialogue.""
Lasso's third campaign for the presidency centered on bringing in foreign investment to create jobs and on expanding investments in the agricultural sector.
It differed sharply from Arauz's promises of handing out $1,000 to a million poor families and returning the country to the social welfare programs of former President Rafael Correa, Arauz's mentor. 
Lasso may have benefited from a protest campaign by indigenous leader Yaku Perez, who called on supporters to vote null in protest of what he called voter fraud in the first round in February. 
Lasso's election win is a rare bright spot for emerging markets, which are struggling under concerns such as Argentina's tense talks with the International Monetary Fund and broader headwinds from rising U.S. interest rates that threaten to spark a selloff.
Ecuadorean bond prices had spiraled last year after Arauz said he would overhaul a $6.5 billion 2020 financing deal. 
Lasso is seen as having greater capacity to negotiate with the IMF, but he has also said he would push back on IMF plans to raise taxes - which could complicate his efforts to keep the government's books balanced. 

And any economic rebound will rest on a restructuring of the country's stalled COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which has been plagued by nepotism allegations and a revolving door of health ministers who have resigned or been sacked.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2021 02:05AM ET</span>","China's exports, imports seen staying buoyant in March: Reuters poll","BEIJING (Reuters) - Improved global demand and a favorable base effect are likely to have kept China's exports buoyant in March, while higher oil prices will have been boosted its imports, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.
China's trade surplus is expected to be $52.05 billion in March, following a surplus of $103.25 billion in the first two months of the year, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll of 27 economists. The data will be released on Tuesday.
Exports are expected to have risen 35.5% in March from a year earlier, according to the poll. The number was down from 60.6% jump in January-February, as the year-ago level suffered a deeper contraction as the the coronavirus outbreak in China passed through its peak.
The rebound of overseas demand for Chinese goods continued with the recovery of global economy amid greater vaccination efforts. Surveys showed U.S. factory activity picked up in March amid strong growth in new orders, and the growth in Euro zone monthly factory activity was the fastest on record.
Official and private manufacturing surveys in China pointed to riobust growth, with export orders returning to growth amid improving foreign demand.
Imports likely rose 23.3% in March versus a year ago, the poll showed, slightly higher than the 22.2% gain in the first two months of the year.
""Import growth might have stayed solid in March on the back of more working days (this year relative to last year), healthy underlying domestic demand, and also higher oil prices,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' economists said in a note. 
However, many analysts believed exports could lose some momentum in the short term and the advantages of orders transferred from other countries due to coronavirus-related disruptions will begin to abate. 
""The current strength of export growth is unsustainable and will unwind over the coming quarters as vaccinations allow a return to more normal global consumption patterns,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, Senior China Economist with Capital Economics.
Other China watchers also noted the resurgent COVID-19 infections abroad and constraints in global trade have left some companies grappling with prolonged delivery timeframes and surging prices of raw materials. 

Makers of cars and electronic devices from televisions to smartphones are sounding alarm bells about a global shortage of chips, which is causing manufacturing delays as consumer demand bounces back from the coronavirus crisis.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese bank lending rose 6.3% in March from a year earlier, data showed on Monday, as restaurants and hotels sought more loans to weather the hit from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Deposits held by banks were also up 9.9% in March as households continued to save rather than spend on uncertainty over the pandemic's fallout, the Bank of Japan data showed.
Outstanding loans held by the country's four main categories of banks, including ""shinkin"" or credit unions, hit a fresh record at 579.995 trillion yen ($5.29 trillion), according to the data. In February, total loans increased 6.2%.
The introduction of a new scheme that offers incentives to banks that channel more funds to pandemic-hit firms has yet to have a major impact on bank lending, a BOJ official said.
""We'll likely seen the impact appear ahead, and hope the scheme will help smooth financial intermediation,"" the official told a briefing.
At its policy meeting in March, the BOJ adopted a new interest paying scheme for financial institutions that tap its cash coffers to boost loans.

After the biggest hit to Britain's economy in more than three centuries last year, accountancy firm Deloitte said its poll found CFOs were planning to increase hiring and investment.
Most workers were expected to return to their offices between July and September after working from home for much of the past year.
Almost 10% of CFOs had experienced significant or severe disruption due to Brexit but only 3% expected that level of disruption to persist in a year's time, Deloitte said on Monday.
""Brexit has been a significant dampener on business activity in the last four years but with the UK's final departure from the EU, such effects are fading,"" Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist, said, noting most CFOs still thought Britain's departure from the European Union would hurt their businesses. 
""Combined with a successful vaccine rollout and a greatly improved global backdrop, we are seeing a turbo-charged surge in business optimism.""
Britain's economy shrank by nearly 10% in 2020 as the country was hit by Europe's highest COVID-19 death toll. But it is expected to start recovering soon as the government lifts its social-distancing rules.
The only category of macroeconomic risk where concerns had risen sharply related to inflation and asset price bubbles, Deloitte said.
A separate survey suggested Brexit and COVID-related problems were continuing for exporters.
The British Chambers of Commerce said 41% of firms reported lower sales in the first three months of 2021, up from an already-high 38% in the previous quarter, led by firms in sectors hardest hit by lockdowns - hospitality, catering, retail and wholesaling.
A third survey showed small firms in Britain were their most confident in more than six years, but one in seven was likely to make some or all employees redundant this quarter.
FSB Chairman Mike Cherry urged the government to offer more incentives for hiring.
""Bringing down the non-wage costs of employment, starting with employer national insurance contributions which essentially serve as a jobs tax, would certainly help,"" Cherry said. 
The Deloitte survey was conducted between March 17 and March 30 and polled 100 CFOs from companies with a combined market value of 547 billion pounds ($751 billion) among UK-listed firms.
The BCC data was based on a poll of 6,103 firms between Feb. 15 and March 11.

Left-wing economist Andres Arauz won the first round of the election in February, garnering almost 33% of the vote, on promises of generous cash handouts and a resumption of the socialist policies of his mentor, former President Rafael Correa.
Arauz's rival, banker and third-time presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso, is promising to create jobs through foreign investment and financial support for the agricultural sector. Lasso won just shy of 20% of the first-round ballots. 
Indigenous activist Yaku Perez, who narrowly lost out to Lasso for a slot in the runoff, is calling on supporters to spoil their ballots to protest what he called electoral fraud during the first round.
The vote will hinge on the roughly 15% of the electorate who remain undecided, said Francis Romero, director of pollster Click Report, describing the figure as unusually high. 
""(The undecided) see that neither option has the capacity to get the country out of the economic and health crises that it's in,"" said Romero.
The oil-exporting nation's economy was already weak due to low crude prices when the coronavirus outbreak started. The pandemic has pushed a third of the population into poverty and left half a million people unemployed.
President Lenin Moreno, who is not seeking re-election, imposed painful austerity measures as part of a $6.5 billion financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund, but was unable to kick-start the economy.
The elections council expects to report the results on Sunday night. The new president will take office on May 24.
Arauz, 36, has offered to give $1,000 to a million families as soon as he takes office, as well as provide benefits to young people such as free internet access.
His plans are being closely watched by foreign investors who hold Ecuadorean bonds, some of whom have expressed concerns about heavy spending plans in the face of the government's delicate finances.
Lasso has tried to soften his conservative image by promising to fight discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and boost protection of animal rights.

Both candidates are calling on supporters to ""take care of the votes"" and denounce irregularities on voting day and during the vote tallying process.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's red-hot housing market has bolstered the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the market imbalances are escalating and driving up already-high household debt, the Bank of Canada said on Friday.
Housing prices in Canada have surged over the last year, with the Bank of Canada becoming increasingly concerned in recent months that gains are being driven by excessive exuberance, investor activity and a fear-of-missing-out. 
""Strength in the housing market is contributing to Canada's economic recovery from the pandemic. But it may also be intensifying housing market imbalances and household indebtedness,"" the Bank of Canada analytical note said.
""The evidence presented here generally suggests these vulnerabilities have increased in recent months.""
The report, released Friday morning, shows that since the onset of the pandemic, outstanding household debt has risen by close to 3.5%, reflecting a surge in mortgage debt. 
New mortgages to highly-indebted households are also rising sharply, the report shows.
Home price growth, meanwhile, has accelerated and is nearing the last peak in April 2017. The Bank also said some measures show rising exuberance in Toronto's housing market.
Canada's financial regulator said on Thursday it plans to tighten its mortgage stress test amid concerns about surging home prices, and to gird against risks when interest rates rise from record-low levels. 
The average selling price of a Canadian home jumped 25% in February, hitting a record C$678,091 ($540,096), according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.
Governor Tiff Macklem said late last month that the central bank was seeing signs of household indebtedness worsening as housing prices soared.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in March, resulting in the largest annual gain in 9-1/2 years and likely marking the start of higher inflation as the economy reopens amid an improved public health environment and massive government aid. 
The report from the Labor Department on Friday also showed solid gains in underlying producer prices last month. That aligned with business surveys showing rising cost pressures as strengthening domestic demand pushes against supply constraints. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday reiterated that he believed the expected rise in inflation will be transitory and that supply chains will adapt and become more efficient. Most economists agree, citing considerable slack in the labor market.
""Beyond temporary effects, inflation is unlikely to keep accelerating given ample slack in the labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. 
The producer price index for final demand jumped 1.0% last month as costs increased across the board. The PPI rose 0.5% in February. In the 12 months through March, the PPI surged 4.2%. That was the biggest year-on-year rise since September 2011 and followed a 2.8% advance in February. 
The year-on-year PPI was boosted as last spring's weak readings dropped out of the calculation. Prices tumbled early in the pandemic amid mandatory closures of non-essential businesses across many states to slow the first wave of COVID-19 cases.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would increase 0.5% in March and jump 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. The PPI report was delayed after the Bureau of Labor Statistics website crashed. The BLS, the Labor Department's statistics agency, said it was looking into the problem with the website.
Goods prices soared 1.7%, accounting for almost 60% of the increase in the PPI last month. That was the biggest increase since December 2009 and followed a 1.4% rise in February. Prices for services shot up 0.7% after gaining 0.1% in February.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
SOLID GAINS
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in relief since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020, while the Fed has slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
Powell said on Thursday that while he expected a surge in demand and bottlenecks in the supply chain as the economy reopens, ""it seems unlikely that will change the underlying inflation psychology that has taken deep roots over the course of many years.""
Employment remains about 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Though vacancies have rebounded above their pre-pandemic level, competition for jobs remains stiff, limiting workers' ability to bargain for higher wages.
But some economists do not share Powell's inflation assessment, arguing that businesses have the capacity to pass on the higher production costs to consumers. Business surveys have indicated that customer inventories are at record lows and order books are full.
""The implication is that manufacturers potentially have the sort of pricing power we haven't seen in years,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""With greater scope to pass these price rises on to customers, the obvious implication is that risks are increasingly moving in the direction of higher CPI readings.""
Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Friday if the expected jump in inflation did not reverse going into 2022, the U.S. central bank ""will have to take that into account.""
According to a Reuters survey, the consumer price index likely rose 0.5% in March, which would boost the year-on-year increase to 2.5% from 1.7% in February. The report is scheduled to be released on Tuesday.
Wholesale energy prices increased 5.9%, accounting for 60% of the broad-based rise in goods prices in March. Energy prices rose 6.0% in February. Food prices climbed 0.5% last month.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices increased 0.6%. The so-called core PPI gained 0.2% in February. In the 12 months through March, the core PPI accelerated 3.1%, the biggest rise since September 2018, after increasing 2.2% in February.
In March, wholesale core goods prices shot up 0.9% after gaining 0.3% in February. The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2.0% inflation target, a flexible average. 
The core PCE price index is at 1.5%. Some of the PPI components, which feed into the core PCE price index, rose moderately last month. 

Airline tickets increased 1.1% after jumping 3.7% in February. Healthcare costs rose 0.2% after dipping 0.1% in the prior month. Portfolio management fees rebounded 1.6% after dropping 1.1% in February.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada added far more jobs than expected in March, bringing employment to within 1.5% of pre-pandemic levels, official statistics showed on Friday, though economists warned fresh lockdowns imposed this month would undo some gains.
Statistics Canada said the country added 303,100 jobs in March, triple analyst expectations of 100,000, as a number of industries continued to recover from December and January shutdowns. 
The unemployment rate fell to 7.5%, beating an expected 8.0% and reaching its lowest level since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Canada added 175,400 new full-time positions in March and 127,800 part-time.
""This is another strong jobs report,"" said Ryan Brecht, a senior economist at Action Economics. ""However, the outlook for April activity has been dented by the return of regional lockdowns.""
Ontario, Canada's most populous province, closed most businesses this month amid a sharp surge of COVID-19 infections driven by faster-spreading variants.
Neighboring Quebec has also added fresh restrictions and tightened curfews in its hardest-hit regions. 
Economists warned that the return of closures would hit employment in the coming months, but noted that the strength and speed of the rebound from the most recent shutdowns was heartening.
""If there is a message, it is that employment can bounce back quickly once containment measures do ease,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC Economics.
""We're also not at the finish line yet in terms of the pandemic, so we could see a rapid recovery in employment later this year. That's assuming that vaccine distribution ramps up as expected and vaccines remain effective,"" he added.
Canada has lagged other major countries in vaccinations, but the pace of inoculations has sped up in recent weeks. 
The labor market strength in March supported bets that the Bank of Canada could adjust its quantitative easing (QE) program as early as this month.
""The scales tip slightly in favor of tapering QE but it really depends on what kind of fiscal outlay there is prior to their decision,"" said Simon Harvey, FX market analyst at Monex Europe and Monex Canada.

Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland will unveil Canada's 2021 budget, which is expected to contain billions of dollars in stimulus, on April 19.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories rose 0.6%, instead of 0.5% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers surged 1.4% in January. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product increased a solid 0.8% in February. 
That suggests inventory investment could contribute to GDP growth in the first quarter. Inventories increased 2.0% in February from a year earlier. Sales at wholesalers fell 0.8% after accelerating 4.4% in January. 
At February's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.27 months to clear shelves, up from 1.25 months in January.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic, helping to underpin manufacturing. But a big chunk of the inventory build is coming from imports, which could keep the trade deficit elevated, which could offset some of the boost to GDP growth from inventories.

Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts fell 0.6% in February. There were increases in stocks of professional and computer equipment, as well as petroleum.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The number of Japan's ""izakaya"" dining bars that went bankrupt hit a record high in the year that ended in March, a sign some service-sector firms are being left behind even as the economy emerges from the shock of the coronavirus pandemic.
A rebound in global growth and domestic consumption has helped the world's third-largest economy recover from the doldrums, with business confidence improving to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter.
But industries that had been hardest-hit, such as restaurants, are likely to remain under pressure as Japan plans to place Tokyo under a new, month-long ""quasi-emergency"" state to combat surging COVID-19 cases.
A total of 175 ""izakaya"" bars - a mainstay of Japanese working culture and late-night drinking - went under in fiscal 2020, up 17% from a year ago and the highest level since compable data became available two decades ago, think tank Tokyo Shoko Research said on Friday.
""People stayed away from the bars to avoid crowds. Small restaurants are also suffering from the cost of investing in equipment to prevent the spread of the virus such as partitions,"" Tokyo Shoko Research said.
Operators of wedding halls also took a hit as people refrained from hosting big banquets, with nine of them going under in fiscal 2020, increasing for the second straight year, Tokyo Shoko Research said.
A separate government survey showed that while service sector sentiment improved in March, an index gauging the outlook worsened on concern over a resurgence in infections.

Refinitiv data shows a rise of 0.6% in March in the forward 12-month earnings estimates of MSCI Asia-Pacific index firms, for the smallest upgrade since June last year.

""The earnings momentum, i.e. the percentage of upwards revisions versus total revisions, is above 60%, back to the level seen in 2017,"" said Frank Benzimra, head of Asia equity strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
However, he said failing vaccine roll-outs, a tightening in financial conditions due to rising UST yields and a stronger dollar could hit the region's profits this year. 
South Korea and Taiwan saw earnings upgrades of 3.5% and 2.4% each in the past month, helped by strong demand for technology products.

By sector, analysts raised earnings forecasts for Asia's energy firms by 8%, buoyed by higher oil prices. Mining firms also saw earnings upgrades of about 5%, fed by a surge in commodity prices this year.
However, India, Indonesia and Thailand were among the nations that faced cuts in earnings over the past month, the data showed.
India, South Korea and Thailand have battled growing virus infections in the last few days, fuelling concern over further lockdowns in the region to curb the pandemic.

Investing.com – China continued on a steady path towards economic recovery from COVID-19, as factory gate prices rose at their fastest annual pace since July 2018 in March and growth in the second-largest economy globally continued to increase its pace.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that the producer price index (PPI) grew 4.4% year-on-year in March, exceeding the 3.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 1.7% growth.
""Markets may become increasingly concerned about pressures from rising inflation on Beijing's policy stance, but we expect Beijing will stick to its 'no sharp policy shift' commitment,”, with annual PPI inflation to rise to around 6.0% mid-year and ""moderate thereafter,"" Nomura chief China economist Ting Lu told Bloomberg.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China shifted to a steadier stance as the country’s economic recovery solidified. The central bank rolled out measures including interest rate and reserve ratio cuts in early 2020 to counter COIVD-19's economic impact,
Separately, the consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.5% month-on-month in March, against the 0.4% contraction in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 0.6% growth. The CPI grew 0.4% year-on-year, above the 0.3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 0.2% decline.
The data is the latest indicator pointing towards solid economic growth during the first quarter of 2021. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indexes released during the previous week indicated that China's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in three months in March.
Falling food prices, especially for pork, continued to drag on consumer inflation in February, a note from an NBS official released alongside the data said.
Although China set a modest growth target of above 6% for 2021 earlier in the year, investors are widely expecting growth to exceed 8%. They remain cautious, however, as COVID-19 uncertainties continue to cloud the economic outlook."

Core machinery orders - a highly volatile data series seen as an indicator of capital spending six to nine months ahead - are forecast to rise 2.8% in February from the previous month after a 4.5% fall in January, the poll of 18 economists showed.
The core orders, which exclude those for ships and electric utilities, likely grew 2.3% in February from a year earlier.
""Manufacturers' capital spending is on the uptick, helped by exports' recovery,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research. ""But non-manufacturers remained cautious about spending on worries about the spread of the coronavirus infection.""
Policymakers are hoping corporate expenditure can help revive the world's third-biggest economy, even though analysts expect it shrank again in the first quarter due to emergency steps to curb the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Bank of Japan's latest quarterly survey showed that big firms expect to boost capital expenditure by 3.0% in the year that began in April, more than market forecasts for a 1.4% gain.
The government will announce core orders data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Wednesday (2350 GMT on Tuesday).
Next week's data also include the BOJ's corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the prices companies charge each other for goods and services.
The index likely rose 0.5% in March from a year earlier, up for the first time since February 2020, led by price gains in oil-related products, the poll found.

The BOJ will release the CGPI at 8:50 a.m. on Monday.

China's producer price index (PPI) rose 4.4% in annual terms, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement, far above a 3.5% rise forecast in a Reuters poll and up sharply from a 1.7% increase in February. 
The inflation data is the latest indicator to point to robust economic growth in the January-March quarter. Data last week showed China's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in three months in March as factories ramped up production to keep up with improving global demand.
""Markets may become increasingly concerned about pressures from rising inflation on Beijing's policy stance, but we expect Beijing will stick to its 'no sharp policy shift' commitment,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura.
He expected annual PPI inflation to rise to around 6.0% mid-year and ""moderate thereafter.""
China's central bank has rolled out a raft of measures, including cuts in interest rates and reserve ratios since early-2020 to support the virus-hit economy, but it shifted to a steadier stance as the recovery solidified.
China's consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% from a year earlier in March, the statistics bureau said in a separate statement, beating a median forecast for a 0.3% rise in a Reuters poll and returning to inflation after two months of price falls. CPI fell 0.2% year-on-year in February.
Falling food prices, especially for pork, continued to drag on consumer inflation last month, according to a note from an NBS official released alongside the data.

China has set a modest growth target of above 6% for this year, but analysts widely expect growth of more than 8% after 2.3% growth in 2020. That was the weakest full-year reading in over 40 years as China grappled with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beijing has warned that uncertainties related to the pandemic, which has claimed more than 3 million lives worldwide, continue to overshadow the economic outlook.

577,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 03:05PM ET</span>",Euro zone producer price growth accelerates in February,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone producer prices increased at an accelerated year-on-year pace in February due to surges for energy and intermediate goods, data showed on Thursday, underlining expectations of faster consumer price growth in the coming months.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.5% month-on-month for a 1.5% year-on-year rise.
Changes in prices at factory gates are usually transmitted to final consumers and therefore herald trends in inflation that the European Central Bank targets with its monetary policy.
Euro zone consumer inflation jumped in March to 1.3%, taking another step higher in what is likely to be a temporary but sharp climb that may put consumer price growth above the European Central Bank's target of near 2% later this year.
The ECB has predicted the surge, warning that inflation may even exceed its target by the close of the year, but has promised to look past what it expects to be a temporary spike in its policy decisions. 
The main change in producer prices in February came from a jump in energy costs, which were up 2.3% year-on-year after months of year-on-year declines. But even excluding energy, producer prices rose 1.2% in February after a 0.7% in January. 
Prices of intermediate goods rose 2.4% year-on-year in February after a 1.0% rise in January while prices of non-durable consumer goods continued to decline.

Wall Street is known for its tough work culture, but remote working during the health crisis has been particularly gruelling for most employees, taking an enormous toll on their health and mental wellbeing.
Global stock markets have seen a strong rebound from lows hit during the start of the pandemic, with low interest rates also leading to a surge in dealmaking activity.
""Given our ongoing remote work environment – coupled with the recent pace of market activity as well as client requests and transactions – your contributions and commitment have become more important than ever,"" the memo said.
In a similar move, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said last month the bank would make efforts to give employees Saturdays off and shift staff from other divisions to the busiest teams in the investment bank.
The move came after media reports revealed that some junior bankers were working nearly 100 hours a week and sleeping five hours a night to keep up with excessive workloads.

 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), another major U.S. bank, last month encouraged employees to limit calls outside work hours and to take their vacations, while announcing a firm-wide holiday on May 28.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",Analysis: A taxing question for multinationals leaves stocks unscathed,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - A global minimum corporate tax rate could deal a major blow to the multinationals which some governments allege shift billions of dollars in profits every year to low-tax havens, as well as triggering a fundamental reassessment of corporate earnings.
The chances of such reform rose this week as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen threw the weight of the U.S. government behind a push to upend international tax rules.
Yet stock markets held near record highs, boosted by the near-zero U.S. interest rates as well as a bet that a proposed 21% minimum tax rate, regardless of where companies make their sales, would not be implemented for years.
But some such as Grace Peters, investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, think future earnings estimates ""could be underpricing the full potential impact of tax increases"".
""The issue is definitely right up as a major risk for companies,"" Peters said after the proposals were aired.
High-profile names including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have been accused by governments in Europe of using legal loopholes in fragmented global taxation regimes to pay less tax.
A minimum corporate tax level would stamp out the ability of companies to move income from ""intangible"" sources, such as patents, software and royalties, to countries with lower rates. 
This could double the existing tax paid on profits for some companies and cause a major headache for countries such as Ireland which have attracted many with a 12.5% rate, which research last year showed is half the global average.
The companies have not commented on the latest proposals.
A paper by Thomas Torslov at the University of Copenhagen and University of California academics Gabriel Zucman and Ludvig Wier calculated that profit shifting amounted to almost 40% of multinational profits and that 35% of these profits came from non-haven EU nations, while 25% were from the United States.
Although technology and healthcare firms are seen as major beneficiaries of tax arbitrage, stock market investors appear not to be fazed by the threat to companies' earnings.
Their focus is possibly on an expected rebound in corporate earnings, with U.S. companies set to report a 25% jump in profits this year, and a near 14% rise in 2022 after the damage inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
INVESTMENT HURDLE?
Irish finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, voiced ""reservations"" about the proposal, while the World Bank has warned against setting a minimum tax rate that is too high, saying it would hinder poor countries in attracting investment. 
Ireland is positioning itself for lower corporate tax receipts and has budgeted for them to fall by 500 million euros a year from 2022 and by 2025 to lose two billion euros a year.
The proposed reforms would probably also lower public revenues in poorer European Union states Hungary and Bulgaria with statutory tax rates of 9% and 10% respectively, UniCredit economist Andreas Rees said. 
And it would shift taxable revenues back to high-tax countries such as France, Germany and Italy where rates range from 28% to 32%, Rees added.
Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Markets said markets appeared sceptical a 21% rate would be adopted and ""it would take a long time to negotiate"".
U.S. THREAT
U.S. multinationals face another blow; the prospect of a domestic corporate tax rate rise to 28%, from the 21% levy set by former-President Donald Trump in 2017. That plan too faces stiff opposition within Congress
Companies have come in for withering criticism for paying little or no U.S. federal tax, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) chief executive Jeff Bezos said this week he supported hiking tax rates to overhaul infrastructure.
UBS analysts predict that a 28% tax rate would deliver a 7.4% hit for S&P 500 companies' earnings per share. They expect the hike to go into effect in 2022, though at a slightly lower 25% rate, which would result in a 3.6% earnings hit.
President Joe Biden signalled on Wednesday he was willing to negotiate how much U.S. companies would pay.
Pimco managing director and the head of public policy Libby Cantrill dismissed fears of a major equity setback.

""While tax increases are likely on the horizon, they are also likely to be watered down in the final version, take longer to pass, be less of a headwind to economic growth, and, as a result, give even more runway for equities and risk assets to rally,"" Cantrill told clients in a blog last month.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 01:01PM ET</span>",U.S. proposal to unblock global tax talks 'interesting' -France,"PARIS (Reuters) -A new U.S. proposal to unblock international negotiations on how to tax big multinationals is an ""interesting"" starting point, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday.
He said his U.S. counterpart Janet Yellen had suggested this week that a broader range of companies should be covered by new rules for taxing multinationals which are being negotiated at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
""If we can be assured that the American proposal covers all of the digital giants without exception, it appears to us to be an interesting point of departure,"" Le Maire told journalists.
Frustrated like many governments that big digital giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) can legally book profits in low-tax countries like Ireland, France in 2019 imposed a digital service tax that it has promised to drop once there is an OECD deal in place.
However, France remains subject to a threat of U.S. tariff retaliation which the previous administration of Donald Trump put in place, judging that the French tax unfairly discriminates against U.S. companies.

Le Maire also said that he was open to considering a higher global minimum corporate tax rate than what had been under consideration so far in the OECD talks.
A rate of 12.5% had been under discussion so far in the negotiations until Washington proposed a rate of 21% this week.

The precariousness of employment for young people rose across the region, according to an investigation by Canadian charity Cuso International based on data from a U.N. commission and a poll by the International Labour Organization. 
""It's extremely difficult for young people to access the labor market due to issues around specialization, lower wages, and poverty,"" the advocacy group's Colombia director Alejandro Matos told Reuters.
More than half of those who stopped working since the start of the pandemic were let go by their employers, the report said, while others saw their businesses close and those employed in the informal sector could not work due to lockdowns. 
""Feelings of sadness, fear and anxiety, as well as discouragement following the crisis prevail among young people, where a greater proportion than in other age groups say their well-being and mental health has also deteriorated,"" the report said.
While job losses among the young caused interruptions in education and training programs, the collapse of businesses and falling wages increased precariousness, underemployment and informal work, the study said.
The majority of job losses came in the first half of 2020, with the numbers of young people in work or education falling by 7.8%, it said. 
Unemployment particularly afflicted those aged 15 to 24, growing by 3.4%, almost twice the rate for those over 25. 

""Young people without access to education, training, or professional experience do not accumulate human capital and find themselves increasingly distant from the realm of decent work,"" the study said.

582,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>","U.S. weekly jobless claims rise again, but labor market recovery gaining steam","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the increase likely understated the rapidly improving labor market conditions as more parts of the economy reopen and fiscal stimulus kicks in.
The second straight weekly increase in claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was at odds with reports this month showing the economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months, and job openings increased to a two-year high in February. Households have also been upbeat in their assessment of the labor market.
""Our belief is that continued moves to reopen the economy will result in a solid further advance in payrolls in the April jobs report and that the claims data are likely not capturing the pace of improvement in the labor market,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 744,000 for the week ended April 3 compared to 728,000 in the prior week. Data for the prior week was revised to show 9,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 680,000 applications for the latest week. Some speculated that spring break-related school closings, the Easter holiday and churn in some industries were behind the surprise rise. 
Others believed the unprecedented surge in claims in March 2020, when mandatory closures of non-essential businesses were enforced across many states to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections, was making it difficult to adjust the data for seasonal fluctuations.
""We suspect that the seasonal adjustment process is the main culprit behind the confounding volatility in claims data in recent weeks as the economy passed the one-year anniversary of the lockdowns from last spring,"" said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in New York. 
Even so, unadjusted claims rose 18,172 to 740,787 last week. 
Some economists also believed the expansion of benefits, including a government-funded $300 weekly subsidy and program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment insurance programs, was contributing to keeping claims high. 
The weekly subsidy and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will run through Sept. 6. Fraud, multiple filings and backlogs have dogged the system. Claims have dropped from a record 6.149 million in early April of 2020, but remain more than double their pre-pandemic level. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000. 
Including the PUA program, 892,539 people filed claims last week, remaining below one million for a third straight week.
The increase in applications was led by California and New York. There were big drops in Alabama and Georgia, as well as Ohio, which has been beset by fraudulent applications.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading largely higher, with the S&P 500 index hitting a record high. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
COMPANIES HIRING
The labor market stumbled in December but has regained its footing thanks to the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package and an acceleration in the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations, which are allowing more services businesses to resume operations.
In the minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 16-17 policy meeting released on Wednesday, U.S. central bank officials acknowledged the improvement in labor market conditions and ""expected strong job gains to continue over coming months and into the medium term.""
Several Fed officials suggested the latest relief package ""could hasten the recovery, which could help limit longer-term damage in labor markets caused by the pandemic."" 
Anecdotal evidence suggests companies are recalling workers laid off during the pandemic and hiring new employees. An Institute for Supply Management survey on Monday showed services businesses reporting they ""have recalled everyone put on waivers and made new hires"" and had ""additional employees added to service the needs of new customers at new locations.""
Still, the labor market recovery has a long way to go. Employment is 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 16,000 to 3.734 million in the week ended March 27. That was down from 23.1 million at the height of the crisis.
The 12th straight weekly decline in the so-called continuing claims in likely due to people finding work and exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states. About 5.634 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended March 20, up 117,108 from the prior week.

Another 786,962 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid, down 230,780 from the week before. There were 18.2 million receiving benefits under all programs during the week ended March 20.
""This points to unemployment insurance remaining a substantial source of household income at this time,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Chief Executive Victor Dodig urged policymakers to focus on measures to boost the supply of homes amid calls for them to intervene to cool a surging housing market. 
""Part of the short-term aberration you're seeing here is low interest rates, lots of liquidity, but not enough supply,"" Dodig said in an interview late on Wednesday.
If regulators introduce measures to cool demand instead, ""that's up to them and we’ll react accordingly,"" he said. ""But the bigger issue is the supply of housing.""
Canada's housing market has been on fire since last summer, with the most recent data from the Canadian Real Estate Association showing sales jumped 39.2% and prices surged 17.3% in February from a year earlier.
Canada's financial regulator said it will relaunch on Thursday a consultation on the minimum qualifying rate for borrowers of uninsured mortgages. It had suspended the consultation, originally announced in February 2020, less than a month later.
As immigration flows continue to grow following the pandemic, many will wish to own, Dodig said. 
""How do we make sure we have supply of housing in place and a plan to make sure that supply grows?"" 
Canada will release the first federal budget in two years on April 19. Economists have called for measures including a capital gains tax on principal residences and a national non-resident tax to help cool the housing market.
Dodig also warned that a recovery in spending could lead to inflation that would make debt more expensive to carry for government, businesses and consumers, and called for ""smart policy"" that enables Canada to ""grow our way out of a situation where there's too much debt.""
Canadian household debt https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/210312/dq210312b-eng.htm was 175% of disposable income in the fourth quarter of 2020, up from 170.8% in the prior quarter, Statistics Canada data showed, while the country's trade surplus with the world narrowed in February to C$1.04 billion from C$1.21 billion in January.

""Policymakers need to be thinking, how do you attract capital into the country, because our foreign direct investment has been going down... how to create a positive current account and positive capital account,"" he said.

Investing.com -- The recovery of the U.S. labor market from the Covid-19 pandemic remains uneven, official data showed on Thursday, as layoffs appeared to tick up again.
The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose to 744,000, defying expectations for a drop to 680,000. The previous week’s number was also revised up a touch.
The numbers come only a week after the monthly labor market report for March showed the U.S. economy creating jobs at its fastest rate in months.
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones, did fall modestly to 3.734 million, from an upwardly-revised figure of 3.750 million the previous week. Meanwhile, the overall number of people claiming benefits under unemployment-related programs fell by 51,000 to 18.165 million. 
Weekly numbers from the Labor Department have been subject to a high degree of volatility, as various states appear to have had problems processing and evaluating their data. 
""It's a surprise that jobless claims aren't improving more quickly,"" Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, said via Twitter. ""The increase over the last 2 weeks is moderately concerning—claims should be falling.""
The minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting, released on Wednesday, had again listed the high level of unemployment as the chief reason why it won't wind down the aggressive monetary stimulus that has now been in place for over a year. While the labor market report showed the economy had created 917,000 jobs in March, overall net job destruction since the start of the pandemic is still around 10 million.

585,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 08:20AM ET</span>","Eleven killed as Myanmar protesters fight troops with handmade guns, firebombs: media","(Reuters) - Anti-coup demonstrators in Myanmar fought back with handmade guns and firebombs against a crackdown by security forces in a town in the northwest but at least 11 of the protesters were killed, domestic media reported on Thursday.
Initially, six truckloads of troops were deployed to quell protesters in the town of Taze, the Myanmar Now and Irrawaddy news outlets said. When the protesters fought back with handmade guns, knives and firebombs, five more truckloads of troops were brought in.
Fighting continued into Thursday morning and at least 11 protesters were killed and about 20 wounded, the media said. There was no word of any casualties among the soldiers.
That would take the toll of civilians killed by security forces to over 600 since the junta seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). It had a toll of 598 dead as of Wednesday evening.
Taze is near the town of Kale, where at least 12 people were killed in a similar clash between troops and protesters on Wednesday, according to news media and witnesses. Security forces fired live rounds, grenades, and machine-guns on protesters who were demanding the restoration of Suu Kyi's government, AAPP said.
""Taze, Kale have many hunters in the jungle,"" said Hein Min Hteik, a resident of the region and a youth activist. ""They have handmade firearms. And now they came out with their weapons in order to protect the locals, while the people were under attack by the junta."" 
A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.
""People will try to defend their own lives and their rights,"" said a former government minister who is part of the CRPH, a group of lawmakers representing the ousted civilian government. 
""People will not wait for CRPH to act,"" the minister said in a video call with Reuters. ""The CRPH cannot stop the possible armed resistance by the people, from the people.""The junta on Thursday arrested Paing Takhon, a model and actor who had spoken out against the coup, his sister told Reuters. In Yangon, the country's biggest city, activists placed shoes filled with flowers to commemorate dead protesters. 
AAPP has said 2,847 people were currently being held in detention.
In addition, arrest warrants have been issued for hundreds of people, with the junta this week going after scores of influencers, entertainers, artists and musicians.
'LOCKED OUT OF EMBASSY'
Paing Takhon, 24, well-known in Myanmar and Thailand, was one of the latest celebrities to be detained. He had condemned the military takeover and pledged support for Suu Kyi. 
His sister, Thi Thi Lwin, told Reuters that the military detained her brother at 4.30 am at their parents' home in Yangon, where he had been staying for several days while unwell, suffering from malaria and a heart condition.
The security forces came with eight military trucks and about 50 soldiers and it was unclear where he had been taken, she said.
The country’s most famous comedian, Zarganar, was arrested on Tuesday, media reported.
Overseas, tussles for control of Myanmar's diplomatic missions emerged again on Wednesday.
Myanmar's ambassador to London Kyaw Zwar Minn said he was locked out of the embassy, with sources saying his deputy had shut him out and taken charge on behalf of the military.
Kyaw Zwar Minn has broken ranks with the ruling junta in recent weeks, calling for the release of detained civilian leader Suu Kyi.

LONDON (Reuters) - British households' spending on credit and debit cards rose strongly to 88% of its pre-pandemic average in the week to April 1, its highest since the week before Christmas, the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday.
The figures are not seasonally adjusted, and the ONS said some of the increase was driven by end-of-month spending on households bills and food shopping. 
But they add to signs that the economy is beginning to pick up as coronavirus restrictions being to ease following the roll-out of vaccines to more than half of Britain's adult population.
Payment processor Barclaycard said on Wednesday that spending at golf courses jumped five-fold last week after they reopened to the public, and also reported more contactless payments which it linked to people buying picnic supplies.
Construction activity last month recorded its biggest jump since 2014, as businesses restarted mothballed projects in anticipation of shops, pubs and restaurants reopening next week, and recruiters reported the biggest increase in hiring of permanent staff in six years.
This week the International Monetary Fund revived up its growth forecast for Britain this year to 5.3%, but it does not see Britain's economy recovering its pre-crisis size until next year, much slower than the U.S. and Japanese economies.
The Bank of England expects rapid initial growth but has warned that there could be a long overhang of unemployment and underemployment after government support is withdrawn.
The ONS said firms reported that 19% of businesses' staff were on furlough in mid March. This is equivalent to 6 million people and well above levels of 11% in early December, before COVID restrictions were tightened to slow the spread of a more infectious variant of the disease.

Some 75.1% of businesses replying to the ONS survey said that they were currently trading as of April 4, up 1.3 percentage points from the previous two-week period, while 22.2% of firms said they were closed temporarily.

587,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2021 05:36AM ET</span>","Eleven killed as Myanmar protesters fight troops with hunting rifles, firebombs - media","(Reuters) - Anti-coup demonstrators in Myanmar fought back with hunting rifles and firebombs against a crackdown by security forces in a town in the northwest but at least 11 of the protesters were killed, domestic media reported on Thursday.
Initially, six truckloads of troops were deployed to quell the protesters in the town of Taze, the Myanmar Now and Irrawaddy news outlets said. When the protesters fought back with guns, knives and firebombs, five more truckloads of troop reinforcements were brought in.
Fighting continued into Thursday morning and at least 11 protesters were killed and about 20 wounded, the media said. There was no word of any casualties among the soldiers.
That would take the toll of civilians killed by security forces to over 600 since the junta seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). It had a toll of 598 dead as of Wednesday evening.
Taze is near the town of Kale, where at least 11 people were killed in a similar clash on Wednesday, according to news media and witnesses. Security forces fired live rounds, grenades, and machine-guns on protesters who were demanding the restoration of Suu Kyi's government, AAPP said.
A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.
The government on Thursday arrested Paing Takhon, a model and actor who had spoken out against the coup, his sister told Reuters. In Yangon, the country's biggest city, activists placed shoes filled with flowers to commemorate dead protesters. 
AAPP has said 2,847 people were currently being held in detention.
In addition, arrest warrants have been issued for hundreds of people, with the junta this week going after scores of influencers, entertainers, artists and musicians.
Paing Takhon, 24, a model and actor well-known in Myanmar and Thailand, was one of the latest celebrities to be detained. He had condemned the military's takeover and pledged support for Suu Kyi. 
His sister, Thi Thi Lwin, told Reuters that the military detained her brother at 4.30 am at their parents' home in Yangon, where he had been staying for several days while unwell, suffering from malaria and a heart condition.
The security forces came with eight military trucks and about 50 soldiers and it was unclear where he had been taken, she said.
The country’s most famous comedian, Zarganar, was arrested on Tuesday, media reported.
'LOCKED OUT OF EMBASSY'
Overseas, diplomatic tussles emerged again on Wednesday.
Myanmar's ambassador to London Kyaw Zwar Minn said he was locked out of the embassy, with sources saying his deputy had shut him out and taken charge on behalf of the military.
Kyaw Zwar Minn has broken ranks with the ruling junta in recent weeks, calling for the release of detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
""It's a kind of coup, in the middle of London... you can see that they occupy my building,"" he told Reuters.
There have also been similar counter claims in embassies in other global centres and at the United Nations. 
Meanwhile, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the junta's leader, said in a statement on Wednesday that the civil disobedience movement, or CDM, had halted the working of hospitals, schools, roads, offices and factories.

Suu Kyi and leading figures in her National League for Democracy party, which won an election in November that was annulled by the coup, are currently in detention facing various charges. 

The United Nations' special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, hopes to visit the country in the next few days, a U.N. spokesman said in New York.

France is one of Britain's most important trading partners within the European Union and many economists forecast that Britain's exit from the world's largest free trade area will prove to be a long-term drag on its growth. 
Britain's statistics office said in March that the COVID-19 pandemic made it hard to quantify the Brexit impact from the new customs arrangements. 
Britain last month delayed the introduction of a range of post-Brexit import checks on goods from the EU by around six months, saying businesses needed more time to prepare because of the impact of the pandemic.
French imports from Britain jumped 27% to 1.48 billion euros in February, returning to a level just shy of the monthly average during the second half of 2020.

Overall, France's trade deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted 5.25 billion euros from 4.19 billion euros in January, led by a fall in the exports of aircraft, pharmaceuticals and manufactured goods.

The seasonally adjusted index rose to 72.9 from 60.0 in February, surpassing analysts' expectations for 60.5. It was the highest level for the index since March 2011 and the second highest since the PMI was launched in 2000.
The Ivey PMI measures the month-to-month variation in economic activity as indicated by a panel of purchasing managers in the public and private sectors from across Canada. A reading above 50 indicates an increase in activity. 
The employment index rose to an adjusted 62.7 from 54.0 in February, while the measure of supplier deliveries edged up to 39.6 from 38.6. Still, it was well below the 50 threshold, indicating that companies are having difficulty meeting increased demand.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>",U.S. trade deficit hits record high as economy gains speed,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. trade deficit surged to a record high in February as the nation's economic activity rebounded more quickly than that of its global rivals and could remain elevated this year, with massive fiscal stimulus expected to spur the fastest growth in nearly four decades.
The economy is roaring as increased COVID-19 vaccinations and the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package boost domestic demand, a chunk of which is being satiated with imports. President Joe Biden last week proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, expected to pull in even more imports and fire up economic growth. 
""The deficit could remain wide this year and next because of the fiscal stimulus and potential infrastructure package that could pass in the second half of this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""As the economy continues to strengthen, this will keep the deficit wide."" 
The trade deficit jumped 4.8% to a record $71.1 billion in February, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $70.5 billion deficit. The goods trade gap was also the highest on record.
Exports dropped 2.6% to $187.3 billion. Exports of goods tumbled 3.5% to $131.1 billion, likely hurt by unseasonably cold weather across large parts of the country. The decline was led by shipments of capital goods, which decreased $2.5 billion.
Consumer goods exports fell as did those of motor vehicles, parts and engines. There were also fewer food exports. The pandemic remained a drag on services exports, especially travel.
Imports slipped 0.7% to $258.3 billion. Goods imports fell 0.9% to $219.1 billion. The drop likely reflected supply-chain constraints, rather than weak domestic demand. Indeed, imports of capital goods hit a record high, boosted by civilian aircraft, medical equipment and electric equipment among others.
Imports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest since October 2018, thanks to $1 billion worth of crude oil imports. That resulted in the United States recording its first petroleum deficit since December 2019.
But imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines decreased as did those of consumer goods. The reduction in trade flows in February was partly due to harsh weather, logistic and transportation problems at ports.
""Congestion at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which together account for a third of U.S. container imports, caused container ships to anchor offshore while waiting for available port space,"" said Jay Bryson, chief economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""Even when ships are docked and unloaded, port executives report higher than normal container dwell time, or the time it takes importers to pick up their cargo from port.""
Following the recent six-day blockage of the Suez Canal, economists expect trade flows remained depressed in March.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly higher.
DRAG ON GROWTH 
When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit shot up to a record $99.1 billion in February from $96.1 billion in January. The so-called real trade deficit is running well above the average for the October-December period. 
Economists at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimate trade could subtract a full percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter, which would be the third straight quarterly drag. 
But that is unlikely to make a dent on first-quarter GDP growth estimates, currently as high as a 10% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter.
Economists expect growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting the global economy to expand 6% this year, driven primarily by the U.S. economy, which the fund estimated would grow by 6.4%.
From the labor market to manufacturing and the hard-hit services industries, activity accelerated sharply in March. 
But the housing market, one of the pandemic star performers is showing signs of fatigue. 
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home fell 4.6% last week, dropping for a second straight week.

According to the MBA, the 30-year mortgage fixed rate has risen to 3.36%, a 10-month high. That, combined with higher house prices due to an acute shortage of properties, is making home-ownership more expensive for some first-time buyers.
""With inventory at record lows and affordability increasingly stretched thanks to rapid house price gains, we expect home purchase demand will trend down this year,"" said Matthew Pointon, senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) -Euro zone business activity bounced back to growth last month, underpinned by a record expansion in manufacturing, according to a survey on Wednesday that also showed the service industry was coping better than expected with new lockdowns.
Europe is battling a third wave of coronavirus infections and governments - also struggling with vaccine programmes beset by delays - have re-imposed curbs on citizens and forced swathes of the dominant services industry to remain closed. 
But IHS Markit's Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 49.6 in March from February's 45.7, much higher than a flash estimate of 48.8 and only just shy of the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""Encouragingly, today's data confirmed the services sector is on the path to recovery,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.
""Despite the health situation remaining fragile and some restrictions being extended, optimism about the vaccine campaigns sends some hopes for the services sector outlook.""
A composite PMI, combining manufacturing and services and seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 53.2 from 48.8, above the 52.5 preliminary estimate.
Growth in Germany's private sector accelerated to its highest level in more than three years while a slowdown in France's service sector eased despite tougher COVID-19 restrictions.
British businesses, outside the currency bloc and the European Union, saw a strong rebound in orders as they prepared for the relaxation of curbs next week, and ramped up their hiring for the first time since the pandemic struck. [GB/PMIS]
SUPPLY SNAGS
Despite the slow vaccine rollouts in the euro zone and a surge in reported coronavirus infections, optimism about the year ahead improved. The bloc's composite future output index rose to 67.9 from 67.0, its highest since February 2018.
That came after factory activity growth galloped at its fastest pace in the near 24-year history of its PMI in March, a sister survey showed last week, though supply chain disruptions and renewed lockdowns in the region could rein it in soon. [EUR/PMIM]
Supply issues led to a big jump in input costs for services firms and they increased their prices for the first time in just over a year. The output prices index rose to 50.5 from 48.1.

Still, a pick-up in euro zone inflation is unlikely to be sustained and a slow recovery from a pandemic-induced recession will keep price growth under the European Central Bank's target for years, a March Reuters poll found. [ECILT/EU]
""The surveys also show that price pressures are building, but this seems to be caused by short-term supply shortages in the industrial sector,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics. ""We suspect this will be temporary.""

The IHS Markit/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index - measuring Britain's huge services sector and its manufacturers - jumped to 56.4 from 49.6 in February, going into positive territory above 50.0 for the first time in three months.
However, the final reading was a little lower than a preliminary estimate of 56.6.
Britain's economy contracted by almost 10% last year but is expected to grow by around 5% or 6% in 2021 as the country makes quick progress with its vaccination programme.
Two thirds of services firms, which have typically been hit hardest by the lockdowns, expected business to increase over the year ahead, the most positive reading since the end of 2006.
Some services companies said they received a boost from increased residential property transactions during March.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced an extension of a tax cut for property purchases on March 3.
A measure of employment turned positive for the first time since February last year, and pointed to the biggest increase in hiring since mid-2019 as businesses planned for reopening when COVID restrictions ease in April and May.
The Bank of England is watching closely for how much further Britain's unemployment rate rises from its most recent level of 5% as it keeps its stimulus programmes at emergency crisis settings.
Business with the European Union remained disrupted after Britain left the bloc's single market on Jan. 1, with orders from Asia and the United States unable to offset the fall in EU exports for service providers.
International travel restrictions also hurt services exporters.

However, the pace of decline in orders from abroad was the least severe in 13 months, IHS Markit said.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 51.5 last month from 45.7 in February.
The figure came in better than a flash value of 50.8 and marked the first month since September above the 50.0 mark that signals growth.
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said the improvement was mainly due to an easing of restrictions for some shops and services while authorities extended other curbs into April.
The better-than-expected performance of services helped to push IHS Markit's composite PMI to 57.3 in March from 51.1 in February.
PMI data released last week showed that German factory activity grew at the fastest pace on record in March thanks to a surge in demand from the United States and China.
The growth outlook for Europe's largest economy remains clouded, however, by a more contagious virus variant and rapidly rising COVID-19 cases that could force authorities to tighten restrictions again in the coming weeks.

Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann told Reuters on Tuesday that the German economy will likely miss the central bank's growth projection of 3% this year as pandemic-related restrictions weigh on business activity.

The pandemic, which has so far claimed more than 77,000 lives in Germany, has devastated Europe's largest economy, even though it has proven more resilient than many expected, partly because of continuing strong export demand from China.
Public spending rose 12.1% to 1.7 trillion euros in 2020 as the government pulled out all the stops to offset the impact of months of lockdown, while tax take fell 3.5% to 1.5 trillion euros, the statistics office said on Wednesday.
The spending spree is set to continue, with German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz last month promising to do whatever was needed to enable Germany to spend its way out of a coronavirus-induced economic slump.
Germany is struggling to control a third wave of the pandemic and is set to keep many businesses, like bars and cinemas, closed until at least later this month.
However, the number of people on shortened working hours declined last month, driven by the industrial sector, which is benefiting from robust exports, the Ifo institute said on Wednesday.
Companies can shorten workers' hours under a government scheme designed to avoid mass layoffs during the downturn by offering companies subsidies to keep workers on the payroll.
In March, 2.7 million employees were on shortened hours, down from 2.9 million, Ifo estimated.
The number of people on the scheme peaked at about 6 million a year ago but had been rising steadily since Germany entered its second lockdown late last year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese households' inflation expectations rose in March from three months ago and their confidence on the economic outlook improved to an eight-year high, a central bank survey showed, a sign the initial pain from the coronavirus pandemic was heeling.
The outcome offers some relief to policymakers struggling to balance the need to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 infections while sustaining a moderate economic recovery.
The ratio of households which expect prices to rise a year from now stood at 62.4% in March, up from 60% in December, the Bank of Japan's survey showed on Wednesday.
A diffusion index measuring households' confidence on the economy a year from now stood at minus 8.5 in March, recovering sharply from minus 23.1 in December and marking the highest level since June 2013, the survey showed.
The poll follows a separate BOJ survey that showed business confidence improving to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter as the economy benefited by robust global demand.
While the economy may have emerged from the pandemic's initial hit, a resurgence in infections and weak wage growth cloud the outlook for consumption.
More households saw income shrink and expect to slash expenditure a year from now, the survey showed, underscoring the patchy nature of Japan's recovery.

The survey will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise when it conducts a quarterly review of its growth and price forecasts at its next rate review on April 26-27.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings rose to a two-year high in February while hiring picked up as strengthening domestic demand amid increased COVID-19 vaccinations and additional pandemic aid from the government boost companies' needs for more workers.
The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday was the latest indication that the labor market had turned the corner after shedding jobs in December as the nation buckled under a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections and depleted government relief.
""Labor demand should continue to heat up as companies brace for a post-pandemic burst in pent-up demand,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 268,000 to 7.4 million as of the last day of February. That was the highest level since January 2019 and pushed job openings 5.1% above their pre-pandemic level. 
The second straight monthly rise in vacancies lifted the jobs openings rate to a record 4.9% from 4.7% in January.
There were an additional 233,000 job openings in the health care and social assistance industry. Vacancies in the accommodation and food services sector, one of the industries hardest hit by the pandemic, increased by 104,000 jobs. Arts, entertainment and recreation job openings rose 56,000.
But vacancies decreased in state and local government education as well as educational services and information.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 6.995 million in February. The report followed on the heels of news on Friday that the economy added 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months.
The labor market is being boosted by an acceleration in the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations and the White House's recently passed $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, which is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and fresh funding for businesses.
Demand for labor could increase further as more services businesses reopen. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday fully vaccinated people could safely travel at ""low risk.""
An Institute for Supply Management survey on Monday showed services businesses reporting they ""have recalled everyone put on waivers and made new hires"" and had ""additional employees added to service the needs of new customers at new locations.""
STIFF COMPETITION
In February, hiring rose 273,000, the largest gain in nine months, to 5.7 million. That boosted the hiring rate to 4.0% from 3.8% in January. Hiring was led by the accommodation and food services industries, which increased by 220,000 jobs. But hiring decreased in state and local government education.
Hiring still has a long way to go, with employment 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
""The labor market continues to improve but remains a long way from what the Federal Reserve would describe as the conditions to restore maximum employment,"" said John Ryding, chief economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.
The U.S. central bank has signaled it would maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance for a while to allow complete healing.
With unemployment well above pre-pandemic levels, competition for jobs remains tough. There were 1.4 unemployed people for every open job in February, well above 0.82 on the eve of the first wave of the pandemic lockdowns 12 months ago. 
""This means employers will have an easier time hiring, but job seekers still don't have the bargaining power they did prior to the pandemic,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. 
Layoffs increased to 1.8 million from 1.7 million in January amid job cuts in the finance and insurance industry. The layoffs rate was unchanged at 1.2%. 
Risks remain to the brightening labor market outlook.
""New strains of the virus and unwillingness to abide by health recommendations could extend the impact of the pandemic on the economy,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""In addition, the severity of the downturn, which closed many business, means that many industries will not bounce back immediately."" 
The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs rose to 3.4 million from 3.3 million in January. The quits rate was unchanged at 2.3%. 

The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. But the pandemic has forced millions of women to drop out of the labor force mostly because of problems related to child care, with many schools still only offering online learning.

MADRID (Reuters) - Tourist arrivals to Spain plummeted 93.6% year-on-year in February as visitors stayed away from bars and beaches in what is usually the world's second most visited country.
International tourism to Spain plunged 80% to 19 million visitors last year - the lowest since 1969 - as coronavirus curbs took their toll. 
That trend continued in the first two months of 2021, data from the National Statistics Institute showed on Tuesday, in further bad news for a country that used to get over a tenth of its gross domestic product from tourism.
Spain received 284,311 foreign tourists in February, 34.6% less than in January. International tourism revenues dropped 93.3% year on year in February, putting many business in jeopardy.
While most tourists came from France, one in four travellers in February, the number of French fell 87.4% from February 2020, the last month before the pandemic hit.
Many French people, weary of their own lockdown, have been flocking over the border to enjoy open bars and restaurants in areas such as Madrid.
Germans, who have started going back to Mallorca, took second spot. 

Estimates from the Funcas think tank show the tourism sector's contribution to Spain's economy slumped to between 4% and 5% last year from around 12% in 2019, jeopardising many businesses.

601,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 11:00PM ET</span>",China's services sector recovery accelerates in March,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A recovery in China's services sector picked up speed in March as firms hired more workers and business optimism surged, although inflationary pressures remained, a private sector survey showed on Tuesday.
The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.3, the highest since December, from 51.5 in February, well above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Firms reported the sharpest increases in activity and overall sales in three months. New export business continued to contract but at a slower pace.
A sub-index for employment rose back into positive territory as businesses hired more workers than they laid off, the survey showed.
The findings were largely in line with an official survey released last week.
Chinese authorities successfully curbed domestic transmissions of COVID-19 virus over the winter, leading to quarantine restrictions and testing requirements being scaled back.
""The Covid-19 flare-ups that occurred in the fall and the winter have basically died down, and the services sector has quickly recovered with supply and demand expanding,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.
But rising input costs and output prices shown by surveys of both the services and manufacturing sectors are not conducive to a sustained post-epidemic recovery, he said.
Costs for services firms continued to grow, according to the survey, although at a slower pace than the month before. Companies raised their prices charged for the eighth month in a row and by the largest amount so far this year.
Chinese services firms were highly optimistic about the year ahead, with business expectations rising to the highest level since 2011.
The services sector, more vulnerable to social distancing restrictions, had been slower to recover initially from the pandemic than the industrial sector.
Domestic COVID-19 cases have largely been controlled in China although a city on the border with Myanmar last week ordered home quarantines and mass testing after new cases emerged.
Analysts expect a strong rebound in China's full-year growth.

Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Tuesday, rose to 53.1 in March, from 51.7 the previous month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's real wages rose for the first time in a year in February, the government said on Tuesday, largely due to prices weakening as the coronavirus pandemic continued to weigh on the economy.
The health crisis and steps taken to keep it in check are having a big impact on the world's third-largest economy, which is expected to have contracted in the first quarter due to weakening consumer spending.
Inflation-adjusted real wages, a key measure of households' purchasing power, rose 0.2% in February compared with the same month a year earlier, the labour ministry said on Tuesday.
It was the first rise in inflation-adjusted real wages in 12 months, after a revised 0.6% decline in January.
But nominal total cash earnings dropped 0.2% in February from a year earlier, down for the 11th straight month, following a revised 1.3% decline in January.
""Since the fall in prices was larger than the drop in wages, it (February inflation-adjusted wages) turned positive,"" a health ministry official said.
The official said a relatively small number of winter bonus payments in February compared with the prior month reduced pressure on overall nominal total cash earnings, which saw their smallest decline in 11 months.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings and determines a wage trend - rose for the second straight month, gaining 0.4% after a downwardly revised 0.2% rise the previous month, according to the data.
Overtime pay, a key indicator of strength in corporate activity, declined 9.3% in February compared to the same month a year earlier, falling at a quicker pace than in January.
Special payments, which include winter bonuses, lost 1.0% in February after a 20.4% decline in January, which was downwardly revised from minus 12.7%.
The ministry defines ""workers"" as 1) those who were employed for more than one month at a company that employed more than five people, or 2) those who were employed on a daily basis or had less than a one-month contract but had worked more than 18 days during the two months before the survey was conducted, at a company that employs more than five people.

Remittances to Mexico in February totaled $3.174 billion, compared to $2.732 billion during the same month last year.
Cash sent back to family members this past January was slightly higher, at $3.298 billion.
Remittances have been on a record run since last year and reached their all-time monthly high in March 2020, as a growing number of Mexican migrants living in the United States dug deep to send extra money to relatives back home to alleviate the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Solid workers' remittance flows have been adding support to the current account and to private consumption, particularly for low-income families, who have a high propensity to consume and are the overwhelming recipients,"" said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos in a research note on Monday.
Most of Mexico's remittances are sent by the millions of Mexicans living in the United States and are a pillar of support for Latin America's second-largest economy, which suffered its steepest contraction in 2020 since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Remittances sent to Mexico totaled $40.61 billion last year. For January and February 2021, Mexico received a total of $6.47 billion in remittances, up from $5.35 billion the first two months of last year.
Remittance flows are expected to remain strong on the back of the $1.9 trillion U.S. fiscal stimulus package and robust economic growth in the United States.

""Generous wage/income support fiscal transfers in the U.S., a very competitive MXN/USD level, and a deep contraction of activity and employment in Mexico have acted as both push and pull drivers of dollar remittances from the U.S. to Mexico,"" Ramos said.

604,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 01:50PM ET</span>",U.S. services sector gauge scales record high; cost pressures mounting,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. services industry activity surged to a record high in March amid robust growth in new orders, in the latest indication of a roaring economy that is being boosted by increased vaccinations and massive fiscal stimulus.
The upbeat survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday followed news on Friday that the economy added 916,000 jobs last month, the most since August. Economic growth this year is expected to be the best in nearly four decades.
""Vigorous services activity in March sets the stage for robust expansion in the second quarter,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""All the right pieces for a faster services recovery – expanded vaccine eligibility, reopenings, and historic fiscal expansion – are falling into place."" 
The ISM's non-manufacturing activity index rebounded to a reading of 63.7 last month also due to warmer weather. That was the highest in the survey's history and followed 55.3 in February.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 59.0 in March. 
The ISM said comments from services industries indicated that ""the lifting of COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions has released pent-up demand for many."" It, however, noted that ""production-capacity constraints, material shortages, weather and challenges in logistics and human resources continue to cause supply chain disruption.""
A raft of reports from manufacturing to consumer confidence and employment have suggested that the vastly improved public health situation and the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package are providing a powerful tailwind to the economy.
The ISM reported last week that its measure of national manufacturing activity soared to its highest level in more than 37 years in March. The services industry, hardest hit by the pandemic, could accelerate further as the economy re-opens. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday fully vaccinated people could safely travel at ""low risk.""
U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the S&P 500 and the Dow hitting record highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

BROAD GROWTH
All 18 services industries reported growth last month. Businesses in the arts, entertainment and recreation segment lauded the reopening of movie theaters in California and New York, which they said was ""creating a surge in demand.""
Retailers said they remained ""cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year as businesses continue to open up and projects come online."" 
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry rebounded to an all-time high from a nine-month low in February. No industry reported a drop in new orders in March. 
The ISM said comments from businesses included ""we have resumed several large projects that were on hold due to the pandemic"" and ""higher sales at retail outlets.""
But businesses are grappling with logistics challenges, port and shipping delays as well as shortages of materials, with some saying ""it is still difficult to find trucks for loads and to secure shipping containers.""
Those supply constraints are raising costs for businesses. 
The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries jumped to the highest reading since July 2008. The surge in these price measures have added to concerns of higher inflation this year. But some economists caution they are not reliable predictors of future inflation.
""These price measures generally follow recent changes in headline inflation that are often caused by changes in energy prices,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""The business surveys could be a signal of higher inflation to come, but the relationship between the survey price data and future inflation changes generally has been weak."" 
Inflation is seen driven by the generous fiscal stimulus and extremely accommodative monetary policy. 
The ISM survey's measure of services industry employment shot up last month to the highest reading since May 2019. That confirmed the sharp acceleration in private services industry employment in March.
Services businesses said they ""have recalled everyone put on waivers and made new hires"" and had ""additional employees added to service the needs of new customers at new locations.""
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed new orders for U.S.-made goods dropped 0.8% in February, likely weighed down by unseasonably cold weather. Factory orders surged 2.7% in January.
Graphic: Factory orders https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbpgxkxavq/factoryorders.png
The weakness in factory orders is likely temporary, though a recent brief blockage of the Suez Canal and global semiconductor shortage could hurt some segments of the manufacturing industry.
That is not expected to have an impact on lofty growth projections for this year. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.

""For the next few months, manufacturing and business investment may struggle a little,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior director at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

A state of emergency declared in the Tokyo area to curb the spread of COVID-19 hurt service sector spending such as restaurants and bars, while demand for home appliances and food and beverage was likely to stand firm, analysts said. 
Household spending is forecast to have fallen 5.3% in February from a year earlier after a 6.1% decline in January, the poll of 16 economists showed.
But compared with the previous month, household spending likely grew 2.8% in February, rebounding from a 7.3% drop in January, the poll found. 
The government will release household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on April 6 (2330 GMT, April 5).
A decline in new coronavirus cases in February helped to improve consumer sentiment from January but a more recent rebound in infections clouds the outlook, analysts said.
""Spending on consumer goods were rather on the uptick in February led by firm demand for stay-at-home and remote working related items,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. 
""On the other hand, spending on services likely remained lackluster. Consumer spending was expected to have picked up in February but the pace of recovery was slow.""

Japan's economy has rebounded from a pandemic-induced deep slump last year. Many economists expect the economy contracted again in the January-March quarter because of emergency coronavirus curbs but then expect an export-led gradual recovery.

The IHS Markit Mexico Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 45.6 in March from 44.2 in February, but remained well below the 50 threshold that separates growth from contraction.
There were widespread reports that business closures, due to coronavirus controls, caused contractions in factory output during March, according to the survey.
""The Mexican manufacturing sector was again hampered by COVID-19 restrictions, with business closures causing further reductions in sales and output. Subsequently, firms continued to lower input purchasing and employment. However, rates of contraction did at least slow,"" said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.
The overall fall was the slowest over the past 12 months, but sharper than any seen prior to that. And after reaching a one-year high in February, the overall level of business confidence fell in March to 55.8, from 58.2 in February.
""While the COVID-19 vaccination program lifted business confidence to a one-year high in February, growing concerns about a further wave of infections and the possibility that controls could tighten restricted sentiment in March. Uncertainty could further delay the recovery, dampening business investments and preventing job creation"", said De Lima.
Mexico's economy is seen growing at a quick pace in 2021 and reaching pre-pandemic levels by the beginning of 2022, after suffering its steepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s last year, the finance ministry said on Wednesday.
The PMI index tracks developments on a range of business indicators including prices, new orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and stocks of raw materials.

607,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders decline in February,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods fell in February, likely weighed down by unseasonably cold weather, though manufacturing remains strong as the economic recovery regains steam amid an improving public health situation and massive fiscal stimulus.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that factory orders dropped 0.8% after surging 2.7% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders slipping 0.5% in February. Orders increased 1.0% on a year-on-year basis. 
Severe weather blanketed large parts of the country, including winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, in the second half of February, disrupting consumer spending, production at factories, home building and sales.
But that's all the rear view mirror. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said last week its index of national factory activity jumped in March to its highest level since December 1983. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, has been buoyed by a shift in demand towards goods from services during the pandemic.
Job growth accelerated sharply in March, the government reported on Friday.
Economic growth is expected take off this year, powered by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the reopening of nonessential businesses as more Americans are vaccinated against the coronavirus. 
Factory goods orders in February were held down by declines in demand for machinery, computers and electronic products, as well as primary metals. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose. 
Unfilled orders at factories increased 0.8% in February after gaining 0.2% in January, suggesting a rebound in demand in the coming months.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, fell 0.9% in February instead of dropping 0.8% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, decreased 1.1%. They were previously reported to have declined 1.0% in February.

Business spending on equipment increased robustly for a second straight quarter in the fourth quarter, contributing to the economy's 4.3% annualized growth rate during that period.

Consumer prices were up 16.19% year-on-year, higher than 16.11% in a Reuters poll and 15.61% in February. Inflation remains well above a 5% official target and has been in double digits for most of the past four years.
Month-on-month CPI inflation was 1.08%, the Turkish Statistical Institute said, compared to a Reuters poll forecast of 1.04%.
The former central bank governor, Naci Agbal, had raised the policy rate to 19% from 10.25%. But he was ousted on March 20 - after only four months on the job and two days after a last rate hike - prompting a 12% drop in the lira to near record lows. 
President Tayyip Erdogan has abruptly ousted four bank chiefs in less than two years, hurting Turkey's monetary credibility and contributing to the currency's long-term decline, which in turn has driven up overall inflation via imports.
Kavcioglu has in the past criticised tight policy, including making the unorthodox claim shared by Erdogan that high rates cause inflation. Yet he has told investors and bankers in recent weeks rates must remain high due to high inflation.
The producer price index rose 4.13% month-on-month in March for an annual rise of 31.2%, the data showed.
The monthly CPI price rise was underpinned by demand in the health, education and hospitality groups, including restaurants, after coronavirus measures were eased. 
Annual rises were driven by higher energy and import prices which raised transportation-related prices by nearly 25%. 

According to a February forecast, the central bank expected a maximum of 17% inflation in March and a bit more in April. Analysts predict it will rise through April, when Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) expects it to peak at 18%.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell slightly to 53.3 in March from 53.9 in February, remaining above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. 
The overall index has fallen from a recent peak of 57.1 in January, indicating the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has lost some momentum.
""The pandemic and associated restrictions continued to trim new business growth, according to respondents, contributing to a more downbeat outlook for business activity over the next 12 months,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
""This largely reflected doubts about clients' willingness to spend as well as the short-term boost to the economy from the vaccine rollout, with some firms expecting market activity to remain subdued until the second half of the year.""
The output subindex slipped to 56.2 from 56.9, dropping further from the 15-month high hit in January and below the series average of 61.5.
The employment subindex, while remaining in contractionary territory, was just below the 50 mark and at its second-highest since February last year.
More than 87% of the firms surveyed gave a neutral forecast for future output, indicating caution among some companies about the speed of the recovery from the pandemic, while 11% expected activity to rise.

""While businesses were hopeful that output would expand over the coming 12 months, the degree of optimism continued to dwindle during March. Notably, the Future Output Index fell to the lowest since last June, but was above the 50.0 no-change threshold,"" the PMI report said.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit UAE Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which covers manufacturing and services, rose to 52.6 in March from 50.6 in February, hitting a 20-month high and indicating a solid upturn in business conditions but still below the series average of 54.1.
""The PMI has also now been above the 50.0 no-change mark in each of the latest four months, signalling increased momentum in the economy's recovery. Likewise, business confidence improved to an eight-month high, with vaccine optimism driving confidence in future activity,"" said David Owen, economist at survey compiler IHS Markit.
The output subindex climbed to 56.3 in March from 51.8 in February, also reaching its highest level since July 2019 but still below the series average of 57.3.
Some subindexes weighed on the overall PMI, however, with input prices ticking up and delivery times on raw materials and key components increasing amid pressure on global supply chains.
""There is growing concern surrounding supply-side factors, however, with global delivery delays having built up during the first quarter of the year,"" Owen said.
""Firms struggling to contain costs may find this acting as a resistance to future output growth as COVID-19 restrictions continue to unwind and new orders start to improve.""
Employment contracted for the second consecutive month and shrank at a slightly faster pace than in February.
Expectations for future output continued a gradual rise into March and the subindex has been rising further into growth territory for four straight months.

""Despite a greater intake of new orders, anecdotal evidence suggested that firms sought to ease cost pressures through staff reductions. That said, the rate of job shedding was much softer than those seen throughout much of the COVID-19 pandemic so far,"" the PMI report said.

A trade agreement between London and Brussels which came into force on Jan. 1 has meant some companies have had to deal with new bureaucracy and rules.
The Survation survey for London First/EY, conducted in February, found 75% had experienced some disruption, even though 71% said they had felt prepared for the changes.
Almost half, 49%, said they expected that to continue in the long-term while nearly a third said they had stopped trading with the EU and countries not covered by rollover agreements.
The findings echo other surveys which indicate businesses have had difficulties with their supply chains, along with other border and regulatory matters, since the new trading arrangements came into operation.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the disruption is mainly due to ""teething"" problems which would ease as firms got to grips with the new system. 
""It’s clear that the disruptions to UK trade with the EU go beyond teething problems with the new regime,"" said John Dickie, Acting Chief Executive of London First.
""If the government is to champion Global Britain successfully, it must redouble its efforts to fix our trading relationship with the EU.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created the most jobs in seven months in March as more Americans got vaccinated and the government doled out additional pandemic relief money, marking the start of what could be the strongest economic performance this year in nearly four decades.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed job gains in February were larger than initially estimated. The best first two months of employment growth of any administration in history suggested the labor market has finally turned the corner.
All industries added jobs and many people rejoined the labor force. A measure of the economy's ability to create employment also improved. But the road to full recovery remains long. The jobs deficit is still huge and more than four million Americans have been unemployed for over six months. 
President Joe Biden welcomed the job growth spurt.
""The first two months of our administration has seen more new jobs created than the first two months of any administration in history,"" Biden told reporters. ""It's a reflection of two things going on here, a new economic strategy focused on building from the bottom to the middle up, and one that puts government on the side of working people.""Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000. Still, employment remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. At the current pace, many believe the more than 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic could be recouped by the end of next year.
The economy added 1.6 million jobs in the first quarter.
The strong gains could play into fears of the economy over heating, even as ample slack remains. The Federal Reserve has signaled it would maintain its ultra easy monetary policy stance for a while to allow complete healing.
""The economy is booming,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""If vaccines result in low enough COVID numbers to allow significant further service-sector reopening, the Fed will have to start discussing a taper, and update its guidance, before the end of this year.""
(GRAPHIC - Substantial further progress for the Fed? Substantial further progress for the Fed?: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/FEDPROGRESS/nmovazmdypa/chart.png)Job growth last month was led by the leisure and hospitality sector, where employers hired 280,000 workers. Restaurants and bars accounted for nearly two-thirds of the industry's employment gains. Construction employment rebounded by 110,000 after being depressed by harsh weather in February.
Manufacturers hired 53,000 employees. Public and private 
education payrolls also rose as more schools resumed in-person learning and other school-related activities. Retailers also added jobs, while mining employment increased by the most since 1981.

As of Friday morning, the United States had administered 157.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country and distributed 204.7 million doses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Friday, the CDC said fully vaccinated people could safely travel at ""low risk,"" which could help accelerate the services industry recovery. 
The Biden administration's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package approved in March is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and fresh funding for businesses.
Economists expect job growth will average about 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.   
First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as an annualized rate of 10.0%. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years. 
The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. Wall Street is closed for Good Friday.
POWERFUL TAILWIND
First-quarter growth prospects got a boost from workers putting in longer hours in March as temperatures rose. The average workweek rose to 34.9 hours from 34.6 hours. That, together with robust hiring lifted aggregate hours 1.5%. 
Though average hourly earnings slipped 0.1% as the lower-wage leisure and hospitality industry dominated payroll growth, a proxy for take home pay increased 1.4%.
""The powerful tailwind of the reopening of economic activity appears to be gathering force,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
(GRAPHIC - The jobs hole facing Biden and the Fed: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/JOBS/xlbpgygrnpq/chart.png)
The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without the misclassification, the unemployment rate would have been 6.4% in March.
Even so, a broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, dropped to a one-year low of 10.7% after holding at 11.1% for two straight months.
About 347,000 people, mostly women, re-entered the labor force in March. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, rose to 61.5% from 61.4% in February. 
The employment-to-population ratio, viewed as a measure of an economy's ability to create employment, increased to 57.8% from 57.6% in the prior month. But about 4.218 million people have been out of work for more than 27 weeks, accounting for 43.4% of the 9.7 million people classified as unemployed last month. That was up from 41.5% in February.

""Overall, the aggressive policy support and speed of this cycle should limit labor market scarring,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, though the labor market recovery is gaining traction as economic activity picks up, driven by increased vaccinations and massive fiscal stimulus.
That was confirmed by other data on Thursday showing a measure of manufacturing activity soared to its strongest level in more than 37 years in March, with employment at factories the highest since February 2018. Layoffs announced by U.S. companies in March were also the fewest in more than 2-1/2 years.
Initial claims have been distorted by backlogs, multiple filings and fraud, making it difficult to get a clear signal on the labor market's health from the weekly data.
""Higher jobless claims in the most recent week don't detract from the strong downward trend, which will continue given the reopening of local and state economies, and the acceleration of vaccinations,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped 61,000 to a seasonally adjusted 719,000 for the week ended March 27, the Labor Department said. 
Data for the prior week was revised to show 26,000 fewer applications received than previously reported, pushing total filings down to 658,000 and below their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a 200,000 to 250,000 range. 
The government revised the claims data from 2016, which showed applications hitting a record 6.149 million in April 2020, instead of 6.867 million in March 2020. 
A staggering 79 million claims were filed under the regular state (UI) programs since mid-March 2020 when mandatory closures of non-essential businesses such as restaurants, bars and gyms were being enforced across many states to slow the first wave of COVID-19 infections.
About 28 more million applications were submitted under the government-funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PAU) program, which covers the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the UI programs.
""Together, that equates to 70% of payrolls, or 67% of household employment, pre-pandemic and reflects duplicate filings and fraud,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""But also the tremendous churn in the labor market since COVID, with some workers losing jobs more than once as restrictions and activity fluctuated this past year."" 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 680,000 applications in the latest week. Virginia accounted for the bulk of the rise. There were also notable increases in California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey and New York.
Including the PUA program, 951,458 people filed claims last week, remaining below one million for a second straight week.
U.S. stocks were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MANUFACTURING SHINES 
Both the economy and the labor market appear to have turned the corner after hitting a ditch in December, thanks to the acceleration in inoculations, which is allowing more businesses to reopen. The White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through Sept. 6.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February. That was the highest level since December 1983. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists had forecast the index rising to 61.3 in March. The survey's manufacturing employment gauge shot up to its the highest reading since February 2018.
According to the ISM, ""significantly more companies are hiring or attempting to hire than those reducing labor forces.""
Indeed, a third report from global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed planned layoffs by U.S.-based companies dropped 11% to 30,603 in March, the fewest since July 2018. Through the first quarter planned layoffs plunged 35%, compared the October-December period. At 144,686, job cuts last quarter were the fewest since the fourth quarter of 2019.
The labor market's improving fortunes were underscored by a survey from The Conference Board this week showing its measure of household employment rebounding in March after three straight monthly decreases. That aligns with expectations that the government's closely watched employment report on Friday will show a surge in job growth in March.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 647,000 jobs last month after rising by 379,000 in February. That would leave employment about 8.8 million below its peak in February 2020, highlighting that a full labor market recovery is years away.
At least 18.2 million people were collecting unemployment checks in mid-March, a sign that long-term joblessness was becoming entrenched. 

""But even at that rapid (hiring) clip, it would take the economy until January 2024 to get back to pre-pandemic trends,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation.
""This cold, hard math underscores the hurdles facing the millions of workers still on state or federal jobless aid as they seek to return to productive work.""

614,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2021 10:20AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing sector index races to 37-year high in March: ISM,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A measure of U.S. manufacturing activity soared to its highest level in more than 37 years in March, driven by strong growth in new orders, the clearest sign yet that a much anticipated economic boom was probably underway. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity jumped to a reading of 64.7 last month from 60.8 in February. That was the highest level since December 1983. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 61.3 in March. The year-long COVID-19 pandemic has boosted demand for goods.
Economic growth is expected take off this year, juiced up by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and the reopening of nonessential businesses as more Americans are vaccinated against the coronavirus.
The relief package passed last month is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through Sept. 6. Households have also accumulated about $19 trillion in excess savings, which are expected to fuel pent-up demand.
President Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled a plan to spend roughly $2 trillion on infrastructure like roads and bridges over 10 years. 
First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.
But the massive fiscal stimulus could leave the economy pushing against domestic capacity constraints and fan inflation.
Suppliers are already struggling to deliver materials to manufacturers, pushing up production costs. That has been most evident in the automobile industry, where a global semiconductor chip shortage has forced cuts in production. 
The ISM survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers last month hovered near its highest since July 2008. 
Its forward-looking new orders sub-index jumped to 68.0 in March. That was the highest reading since January 2004 and was up from 64.8 in February. Factories also received more export orders, while order backlogs swelled.
There is room for further expansion, with inventories at manufacturers and their clients still lean. With demand robust, factories hired more workers in March. The survey's manufacturing employment gauge shot up to 59.6, the highest reading since February 2018, from 54.4 in February. 

That supports expectations for a sharp acceleration in employment growth in March. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 647,000 jobs last month after rising by 379,000 in February. The government is due to publish March's employment report on Friday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Industrial production in Brazil fell in February for the first time in 10 months, figures showed on Thursday, an unexpected decline that adds weight to a growing view that Latin America's largest economy shrank in the first quarter.
February's 0.7% fall in industrial output was significantly weaker than the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists for a 0.4% rise. The following chart shows that several months of slowing growth have finally turned into outright decline.
Graphic: Brazil industrial output https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkpleonzvb/INDUS.png
Statistics agency IBGE said the year-on-year rise was 0.4%, also well below the Reuters poll forecast of 1.5% growth.
Brazil is being battered by a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. With 67,000 deaths in the month triggering renewed lockdowns, the immediate outlook for industry and wider economy is darkening.
""With the surveys for this month deteriorating and car plants shutting amid the latest COVID-19 outbreak, the data for March and April are likely to be worse still,"" said William Jackson, chief emerging market economist at Capital Economics.
""Overall, the risks to our 3% GDP growth forecast for this year increasingly look skewed to the downside,"" he said.
The central bank last week raised its 2021 industrial output growth forecast to 6.4% from 5.1%. But the latest survey by the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank showed that industrial confidence fell in March to its lowest since August.
IBGE said the main drivers of February's decline were a 7.2% slump in auto and auto parts production in the month, and a 4.7% decline in mining output.
Three of the four major categories saw output fall in February, led by a 4.6% decline in durable goods production, while of the 26 industry segments surveyed, 14 registered lower output, IBGE said.
Brazil's industrial sector in February was 2.8% bigger than February last year, just before the global COVID-19 pandemic erupted, IBGE said, but still 13.6% smaller than its peak from May 2011.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 58.5 in March from 54.8 in February, posting the highest reading in the 10-year history of the survey. A reading above 50 shows growth in the sector.
""Canadian manufacturers ended the first quarter of 2021 on an upbeat note,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""The growth was driven by stronger demand as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease across the provinces.""
The new orders index rose to 58.0, its highest since November 2013, from 54.4 in February, while the measure of output was at 57.7, up from 52.0.
Last month, the Bank of Canada said it now expected the economy to grow in the first quarter, an upgrade from its January forecast of a contraction, saying it was proving more resilient to a second wave of COVID-19 infections than expected. 
On a more cautious note, material shortages and border restrictions linked to the pandemic contributed to the greatest lengthening in lead times since April last year, IHS Markit said.
The suppliers' delivery times index fell to 28.7 from 34.0 in February, while the measure of input prices rose to the highest since August 2018.

Still, manufacturers were upbeat about their prospects for growth in the year ahead, with the future output index climbing to 67.6, its highest level since May 2019.

Investing.com --- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose unexpectedly last week, signaling that the improvement in labor market trends remains uneven despite the reopening of large swathes of the economy.
The Labor Department said 714,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, up from 658,000 the previous week. The latter figure, which was already the lowest since the pandemic started destroying jobs a year ago, was revised down by 26,000. 
Analysts had expected a marginal decline in initial claims to 680,000.  
The number of those making continuing claims, which is compiled with a one-week lag to the initial claims data, fell to 3.794 million.
Millions more remain on other, pandemic-related insurance programs. The overall number of people claiming under all unemployment-related programs - collated parallel to the continuing claims series -  resumed its longer-term decline in the week through March 13. It fell by over 1.5 million to 18.21 million.
The numbers suggest that layoffs are still running at a historically high level, despite evidence of a sharp improvement in hiring trends through mid-March. Private-payroll processor ADP said on Wednesday that the economy added 517,000 jobs in March, nearly three times the February number, as various states relaxed pandemic-driven restrictions that have mainly hit labor-intensive service industries.
The government's more authoritative labor market survey is due to be released on Friday. Analysts expect total nonfarm payrolls to have risen by 647,000. The ADP and government numbers have shown a much lower correlation during the pandemic than before it."

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Factories across Europe and Asia ramped up production in March as a solid recovery in demand helped manufacturers move past the setbacks of the pandemic, although escalating costs and supply- chain disruptions were creating challenges and driving prices.
A series of upbeat factory surveys released on Thursday reinforced market optimism that vaccine rollouts, as well as strong growth in global powerhouses like the United States and China, would help economies emerge from their sharp downturns of 2020.
Euro zone monthly factory activity growth galloped at its fastest pace in the near 24-year history of a leading business survey last month, but supply chain disruptions and renewed lockdowns in the region may rein it in soon. [EUR/PMIM]
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 62.5 in March from February's 57.9, above the initial 62.4 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
""The euro zone manufacturing sector proved once again to remain resilient through the re-imposed wave of lockdowns,"" said Maddalena Martini at Oxford Economics.
In Germany, Europe's largest economy, activity grew at the fastest pace on record. In France, the bloc's second-biggest economy, it hit levels not seen since the internet boom at the turn of the century.
But much of Europe is suffering a third wave of coronavirus infections, and with a slow vaccine rollout in the region, governments have re-imposed tough controls on citizens, likely hitting the bloc's dominant services industry hard.
Meanwhile, supply-chain issues, exacerbated when the recent blockage of the Suez Canal caused disruption in global shipping and ports that could take months to resolve, has driven a surge in input prices and the biggest increase in suppliers' delivery times since the survey began.
""Margins are coming under pressure because of all the supply-chain issues. The Suez issue didn't help and we now have inventories at very low levels,"" said David Owen at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
In Britain, outside the currency union, factories rode a wave of orders and prepared for a gradual re-opening of the economy from its COVID-19 shutdowns by hiring staff at the fastest rate since 2014. [GB/PMIM] 
ASIA EXPANDS
Japan and South Korea saw factory activity expand in March thanks to solid demand at home and abroad, PMIs showed, offering relief to policymakers facing pressure to speed up a patchy recovery.
""South Korean manufacturers continued to signal strong optimism as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations began and demand for new products accelerated,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit.
China's factory activity in March expanded at the slowest pace in almost a year, though underlying economic conditions remained positive.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI, which focuses on smaller firms, dropped to 50.6 in March from February's 50.9, missing market expectations.
The private-sector survey came after the official manufacturing PMI on Wednesday, which showed Chinese factories cranking up production after a brief lull during the Lunar New Year holiday.
Activity in big, export-reliant economies stayed brisk.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan PMI rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.7 in March from the previous month's 51.4 reading, marking the fastest expansion since October 2018.
South Korea's PMI stood at 55.3 in March, with activity expanding for a sixth straight month.
Manufacturing activity also accelerated in Taiwan, Vietnam and Indonesia, the March PMI surveys showed. Malaysian activity continued to decline but at a slower pace.
Although supply-chain disruption related to previous COVID-19 outbreaks eased, China's Caixin survey showed factories reporting a sharp increase in input costs.

""Input prices continue to outpace output prices, suggesting there may be some risk to profit margins,"" said Erin Xin, China economist at HSBC.
""Should there be significant compression in profit margins, this could dampen firms' capex spending in the coming quarters.""

With Europe suffering a third wave of coronavirus infections, governments have re-imposed tough controls on their citizens, hurting the bloc's dominant service industry and leaving it to manufacturers to drive the economic recovery.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 62.5 in March from February's 57.9, ahead of the initial 62.4 ""flash"" estimate and the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Monday that is seen as a good gauge of economic health, climbed to 63.3 from 57.6, well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and easily a survey high.
""Euro zone manufacturing is booming,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""Although centred on Germany, which saw a particularly strong record expansion during the month, the improving trend is broad based across the region as factories benefit from rising domestic demand and resurgent export growth.""
But supply chain issues, likely exacerbated by the recent blockage of the Suez Canal which has caused disruption to global shipping and at ports that could take months to resolve, has driven a surge in prices and the biggest increase in suppliers' delivery times since the survey began.
Both the readings for input and output prices were near record highs. The input price index jumped to 79.7 from 73.9, a level not seen in a decade.
""While the forces driving prices higher appear to be temporary, linked to the initial rebound from COVID-19 lockdowns, any further upward pressure on firms' costs and selling prices is unwelcome,"" Williamson said.

Still, as factories struggled to meet flourishing demand they increased headcount sharply and built up a solid backlog of work.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, reached 66.6, matching the record flash reading achieved thanks to a surge in demand from the United States and China.
Factories in Europe's biggest economy have been humming along during the pandemic almost undisturbed by lockdowns that have impacted the services sector.
""It was a record-breaking month on many fronts including new export orders, which have benefited from synchronised upturns in sales to the US and China and seen an unprecedented number of German manufacturers reporting growth,"" said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit.

He added: ""However, the Suez Canal blockage could not have come at a worse time, with more than three-quarters of German manufacturers already reporting increasing lead times on inputs in March, with the potential for those numbers to increase further given the backlog of containers it created and the anticipated congestion at ports in the coming days and weeks.""

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity in March expanded at the slowest pace in almost a year thanks to weaker overall domestic demand, a private survey said. However, underlying economic conditions remained positive even as manufacturers’ input and output inflationary pressures intensify.
The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was at 50.6 in March, against the 51.3 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 50.9 reading.
The figure remained above the 50-mark indicating growth but contrasted with the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs released a day earlier, which read 51.9 and 56.3 respectively.
The survey said that the supply chain disruption due to previous COVID-19 outbreaks had eased for the small, private and export-oriented firms included, but input costs increased at their fastest rate in 40 months.
However, with producer price inflation in February already at its highest level in more than two years, some investors are paying attention.
""We should pay attention to inflation in future as the gauges for input and output prices have been rising for several months... the growing inflationary pressure limits the room for future policies and is not a good thing for sustaining an economic recovery in the post-epidemic period,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
Exporters also continue to face a squeeze in profits as raw material prices surge thanks to a rallying Chinese yuan and rising labor costs. The survey also said that Chinese manufacturers reduced their staffing levels for a fourth consecutive month in March, albeit marginally.
Adding a positive note was the overall progress in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout globally, which increased overseas demand and the return to growth of new export orders. Firms also remained optimistic about the business outlook in 2021 due to hopes of an end to COVID-19, the rebound in overseas demand and plans to expand capacity.
Meanwhile, the Caixin services PMI focusing on the services sector is due on the following week."

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 50.6 last month - the lowest level since April 2020 - from February's 50.9, missing analyst expectations for an uptick to 51.3. 
The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The findings contrast with those in an official survey which showed manufacturing activity grew at a stronger pace as large firms ramped up production after a brief lull during the Lunar New Year holidays.
Although supply chain disruption related to previous COVID-19 outbreaks eased, the private survey showed factories reported a sharp increase in input costs, which surged at their fastest clip in 40 months. 
The Caixin survey focuses on small, private and export-oriented firms while the official survey typically polls large and state-owned manufacturers. 
Producer price inflation in February already picked up to its highest level in more than two years.
""We should pay attention to inflation in future as the gauges for input and output prices have been rising for several months,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release. 
""The growing inflationary pressure limits the room for future policies and is not a good thing for sustaining an economic recovery in the post-epidemic period.""
Exporters previously told Reuters that they were a facing a squeeze in profits due to surging raw material prices, a rallying Chinese currency and rising labour costs. 
But not everything was gloomy, as Thursday's survey showed the return to growth of new export orders as foreign demand improves amid greater global COVID-19 vaccination efforts - in line with findings in the official survey. 
Chinese manufacturers trimmed their staffing levels for the fourth straight month in March, but the rate of reduction was only marginal. 
Firms also remained strongly optimistic about the business outlook over the next year due to hopes of an end to the pandemic, a rebound in overseas demand and plans to expand capacity, the survey showed.
China managed to largely bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control much earlier than many countries as authorities imposed stringent anti-virus curbs and lockdowns at the initial phase of the outbreak.
That has helped its economy mount a rapid turnaround after a slump at the start of 2020, led by resurgent exports growth as factories raced to fill overseas orders. 
Beijing has set an annual economic growth target at above 6% this year, well below analyst expectations for an expansion of more than 8% as authorities emphasised the importance of solidifying the recovery rather than chasing higher GDP numbers.

China was the only major economy to post growth last year with an expansion of 2.3%, but that still marked the weakest annual pace in more than 40 years due to the COVID-19 fallout.

The private-sector survey likely offers some relief to Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's government, as policymakers face pressure to speed up a patchy economic recovery that is expected to stall in the first quarter.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.7 in March from the previous month's 51.4 reading.
The rise in the headline figure, which was stronger than a preliminary 52.0 reading, marked the fastest expansion in manufacturers' activity since October 2018.
Output levels rose for the second straight month, with firms reporting that overseas and domestic demand continued to recover as the impact of the health crisis began to dissipate.
But new overseas orders expanded at a slower pace than in February, with firms reporting that external demand strength was centred on Asian economies such as China and South Korea.
""Japanese manufacturers were confident that output would continue to rise over the coming 12 months,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Firms cited hopes that a successful vaccination rollout which began in March would help to bring a quicker end to the pandemic and allow for a broad-based recovery in demand.""
The survey also showed that producers are facing a jump in input prices, which expanded at their fastest pace since late 2018, mainly due to higher raw material costs.

Manufacturers partly passed on those increased input costs to their customers, the survey said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese big manufacturers' sentiment improved to pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter as companies planned to increase capital expenditure this year, suggesting the export-reliant economy was benefiting from a solid recovery in global demand.
Confidence among big non-manufacturers also recovered from three months ago, underscoring the fading strains from the coronavirus pandemic, a central bank survey showed on Thursday.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment rose to plus 5 in March from minus 10 in December, the Bank of Japan's closely-watched ""tankan"" survey showed, marking the third straight quarter of improvement and hitting the highest level since September 2019.
It compared with market forecasts of a flat reading.
The data offers some relief for policymakers striving to revitalise the pandemic-hit economy as a fourth wave of infections raises uncertainty about the outlook.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment improved to minus 1 in the March survey from minus 5 in December, the survey showed.
Big firms expect to increase capital expenditure by 3.0% in the year that began in April, compared with a median forecast for a 1.4% increase, the survey showed.
Like many countries, Japan deployed massive monetary and fiscal stimulus over the past year to lift the economy back from a record postwar slump.
Many analysts expect the economy to have contracted in the first quarter but see it gradually emerging from the doldrums as solid exports offset some of the weakness in consumption. 

The BOJ tankan indexes are derived by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired the most workers in six months in March as more Americans got vaccinated against COVID-19, pushing the economy towards a broader reopening, which is expected to unleash a strong wave of pent-up demand in the coming months.
Though the private payrolls gain shown in the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday was slightly below economists' expectations, the jump in hiring aligned with a recent improvement in labor market conditions. The broad-based increase was led by the leisure and hospitality industry. 
The labor market and economy are also being supported by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package.
""Companies were hiring again in March and the economy was roaring,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
Private payrolls surged by 517,000 jobs this month after rising 176,000 in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls increasing by 550,000 jobs in March.
The leisure and hospitality sector added 169,000 jobs after only 51,000 in February. Construction payrolls rebounded by 32,000 jobs, while hiring at factories rose by 49,000 positions. 
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics.
It has a very poor track record of predicting the private payrolls count in the government's more comprehensive, and closely watched employment report because of methodology differences. Recent reports have pointed to rapidly improving labor market conditions. 
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits has dropped to the lowest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. A report on Tuesday showed a measure of household employment rebounding by the most in a year in March after three straight monthly decreases.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
STRONG JOB GAINS EXPECTED
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely surged by 647,000 jobs in March after rising by 379,000 in February. The government is due to publish March's employment report on Friday.
""We still expect nonfarm payrolls to show an above-consensus 700,000 gain, with a lot of that gain reflecting the rebound in leisure and hospitality employment,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York. 
Economists are hopeful that the labor market has turned the corner after shedding 306,000 jobs in December. The relief package passed this month is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through Sept. 6.
That is expected to drive consumer spending beginning in March. In addition, Americans have amassed about $1.9 trillion in excess savings, which economists expect will fuel consumer spending when the economy fully re-opens this year and well into 2021, and spur demand for workers.
Atlanta Federal Reserve bank president Raphael Bostic said on Tuesday, ""a million jobs a month could become the standard through the summer.""
Employment is 9.5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. While the labor market is regaining its footing, the housing market appears to be stumbling as surging prices amid tight supply and rising mortgage rates reduce affordability. 
A separate report on Wednesday from the National Association of Realtors showed its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in February, tumbled 10.6%, with contracts falling in all four regions.
Economists had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would decline 2.6% in February. Compared to a year ago, pending home sales slipped 0.5% in February. Contracts had increased for eight straight months on a year-on-year basis. 
The supply of existing homes is at a record low. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to a nine-month high of 3.17%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Mortgage rates have increased since February.
The decline in contracts suggested sales of previously owned homes could fall further in March after dropping sharply in February. A third report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to buy a home fell last week after four straight weekly increases.
""The housing market continues to face both tailwinds and headwinds. Pent-up demand and a strong economic rebound should support sales as we head into the heart of the spring home selling season,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""However, tight inventories and home prices at multi-year highs will make homebuying difficult for some households.""

Data on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller house price index soared 11.2% in January from a year ago, the fastest in 15 years, after rising 10.4% in December.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Unemployment in Brazil rose in January for the first time in four months, figures showed on Wednesday, kicking off the year back above 14% as job growth failed to keep pace with the number of people returning to the labor market to look for work.
The 14.2% jobless rate in the three months to January was slightly higher than the 14.1% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, inching back up towards the record 14.6% in the three months to September. It was up from 13.9% in the final quarter of 2020.
Figures from statistics agency IBGE showed that the number of Brazilians officially unemployed in the three months to January rose slightly to 14.3 million from 14.1 million in the three months to October, and up 20% from a year ago.
Some 86 million Brazilians had work, up 2% or 1.7 million people from the August-October period, although still down 8.6% or 8.1 million people from the same period a year earlier.
The workforce stood at 100.3 million people, up 2% or 1.9 million from the three months through October, and the number of people out of the workforce entirely fell by 1.1% to 76.4 million, IBGE said.
The under-employment rate fell to 29% from 29.5% in the August-October period, IBGE said.

The Federal Labour Office said the number of people out of work fell by 8,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.745 million. The unemployment rate remained unchanged from the previous month at 6.0%. 
Germany is struggling to control a third wave of the pandemic and has been in lockdown since November although some measures were eased in early March with schools and hairdressers re-opening.

""Overall, however, the labour market continues to show signs of the crisis that has lasted a year,"" he added

Some 2.85 million employees were on shortened working hours in January under a government scheme designed to avoid mass layoffs during the downturn by offering companies subsidies to keep workers on the payroll. 
The number of people on the scheme peaked at about 6 million last April but has been rising steadily since November, said the Office.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's coronavirus-hammered economy grew more quickly than previously thought in the final three months of last year but still shrank by the most in more than three centuries in 2020 as a whole, official data showed on Wednesday.
Gross domestic product increased by 1.3% between October and December last year from the previous three-month period, the Office for National Statistics said.
That was stronger than an earlier estimate of 1.0% growth as the ONS received more data in recent weeks.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the growth rate to remain at 1.0%.
In 2020, gross domestic product fell by 9.8% from 2019, only slightly less sharp than an initial estimate of a 9.9% slump.
Britain's economy suffered the biggest drop of all countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development except for Argentina and Spain last year, OECD data has shown.
Britain's economy remained 7.3% smaller than before the pandemic, in inflation-adjusted terms, the second biggest drop among eight major economies listed by the ONS. 
But in nominal terms - which is affected less by differences in the way countries compile the data - Britain stood middle of the pack.
Data also showed households were sitting on a big pile savings that the Bank of England thinks will fuel a jump in spending as the government lifts restrictions on the economy between now and late June.
The savings ratio rose to 16.1% from 14.3% in the third quarter and for 2020 as a whole it hit a record high of 16.3%, compared with 6.8% in 2019.
Separate data showed Britain's current account deficit widened to 26.3 billion pounds in the fourth quarter, almost double the shortfall in the third quarter, as firms rushed to import goods before the Jan. 1 start to the country's less open trade relationship with the European Union.

But the deficit - a long-standing concern for investors because it leaves Britain reliant on foreign inflows of cash - came in below forecasts of 33 billion pounds in the Reuters poll.
It was equivalent to 4.8% of GDP, or 4.2% excluding volatile movements of precious metals such as gold.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 12:26AM ET</span>","Japan's factory output falls, hit by quake, chips shortage","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output fell in February as an earthquake and semiconductor shortage led to declines in the production of cars and electrical machinery, adding to worries for an economy struggling to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
The world's third-largest economy is expected to contract in the current quarter due to coronavirus-related curbs that were imposed from early January for Tokyo and other prefectures.
Official data released on Wednesday showed factory output shrank 2.1% from the previous month in February, dragged down by falls in production of cars, electrical machinery and information and communication equipment.
Disrupting production was a magnitude 7.3-earthquake off the coast of eastern Japan on Feb. 13, which damaged homes and businesses throughout the northern region.
""The semiconductor shortage and natural disasters pushed down output by quite a lot,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""It will be hard for production to rebound,"" said Sera. ""If there is a recovery in production, the pace will likely be very gradual.""
The output fall was worse than a 1.2% decline expected by economists and followed the previous month's sharp 4.3% gain.
Factories worldwide are struggling with a global semiconductor shortage, which has hurt the production of cars, smartphones and home appliances. 
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to drop another 1.9% in March, followed by a 9.3% rebound in April.
A trade ministry official said a March 19 fire at a Renesas Electronics chip-making plant was not reflected in the forecasts. 
Renesas, which commands nearly a third of the global market share for microcontroller chips used in cars, said on Tuesday it would take at least 100 days to get back to normal production at the plant.
Factory output had rebounded in January largely thanks to a sharp increase in the production of electronic parts and general-purpose machinery, as demand for tech-making equipment remains strong.
Some analysts, however, worry that Japan's economic recovery will be dragged down by weak spending at home and a slower-than-anticipated demand recovery abroad as economies slowly reopen, even in countries that have rolled out COVID-19 vaccines.
There is not much the government could do in terms of policy support if manufacturers' production remains hobbled by parts shortages, said Sumitomo Mitsui's Sera.
""If there would be temporary layoffs due to factory closures, the government could provide subsidies for that as part of economic policies,"" she said.

""But I don't think policies will help with boosting production,"" she added.

631,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 31, 2021 12:17AM ET</span>","China Continues Solid Economic Recovery, Manufacturing and Service PMIs Rise","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Chinese manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in three months in March, with increased production after the Lunar New Year holidays and increasing overseas demand boosting the country on its road to a solid economic recovery.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day said that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for March was 51.9, higher than both the 51 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and February’s 50.6 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 56.3, also surpassing its February reading of 51.4. Both indexes remained above the 50-mark indicating growth.
“The latest official PMI surveys suggest that after being hit by COVID-19 disruptions earlier in the year, growth bounced back strongly this month,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note ahead of the data’s release.
Factory activity is usually dormant during the Lunar New Year holidays, which were in February this year. However, with workers discouraged from the customary travel to their hometowns during the holiday due to an outbreak of COVID-19 cases, factories resumed business earlier than expected. The domestic number of cases has now decreased, and everyday activity is returning to normal levels.
Although increasing overseas demand helped export orders returned to growth, Capital Economics’ Evans-Pritchard believes that the exports momentum could slow over the shorter term and in turn impact the manufacturing sector.
“The current strength of exports is likely to unwind over the coming quarters as vaccinations allow a return to more normal global consumption patterns,” the note added.
With COVID-19 cases resurging in areas such as Europe, the constraints in global trade have led some companies with inadequate imports of few raw materials, leading to prolonged delivery timeframes, NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement accompanying the data.
Makers of cars and electronic devices, including TVs and smartphones, are sounding warnings about the global shortage of chips, which is causing manufacturing delays, as consumer demand bounces back.
The NBS data also showed that the service sector, whose recovery has been slower than that of the manufacturing sector, picked up significantly in March, as consumers slowly start to open their wallets.
Meanwhile, the Caixin manufacturing and services PMIs for the private sector are due later in the week."

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's manufacturing activity expanded at the quickest pace in three months in March as factories cranked up production after a brief lull during the Lunar New Year holidays, with improving global demand adding further momentum to a solid economic recovery.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 51.9 from 50.6 in February, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the 13th straight month.
Analysts had expected it to rise to 51.0.
""The latest official PMI surveys suggest that after being hit by virus disruptions earlier in the year, growth bounced back strongly this month,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients after the data release. 
Chinese factory activity normally goes dormant during the Lunar New Year break, but this year millions of workers stayed put due to COVID-19 fears, which led to an earlier-than-usual resumption of business at factories. 
Authorities successfully curbed the domestic transmission of COVID-19 virus during the winter, leading to quarantine restrictions and testing requirements being scaled back as life once again returns to normal.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed both the sub-indexes for production and new orders stood at the highest level since December.
Adding to the positive impulse, export orders returned to growth amid improving foreign demand, the survey showed.
EXPORTS TO SLOW? 
Capital Economics' Evans-Pritchard believes the exports momentum could slow over the shorter term, and in turn weigh on the manufacturing sector.
""The current strength of exports is likely to unwind over the coming quarters as vaccinations allow a return to more normal global consumption patterns.""
China managed to largely bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control much earlier than many countries as authorities imposed stringent anti-virus curbs and lockdowns at the initial phase of the outbreak.
That has helped its economy mount a rapid turnaround after a slump at the start of 2020, led by resurgent exports growth as factories raced to fill overseas orders. Factory-gate prices have accelerated at their fastest pace in more than two years, while industrial output has also surged.
The resurgent COVID-19 infections abroad and constraints in global trade have seen some surveyed firms grappling with inadequate imports of few raw materials, leading to prolonged delivery timeframes, said Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician with the NBS in a statement accompanying the data.
Makers of cars and electronic devices including from TVs to smartphones are sounding alarm bells about a global shortage of chips, which is causing manufacturing delays as consumer demand bounces back from the coronavirus crisis.
Beijing has set an annual economic growth target at above 6% this year, well below analyst expectations for an expansion of more than 8%. 
China's was the only major economy to post growth last year with an expansion of 2.3%, but that still marked the weakest annual pace in more than 40 years due to the COVID-19 fallout.

Growth in China's services sector picked up significantly in March, a separate survey showed, as consumers opened up their wallets after months of hesitation.
A sub-index for activity in the construction sector stood at 62.3 as weather turns warm, compared with 54.7 in February.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2021 12:00PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence hits one-year high; house prices soar,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer confidence raced in March to its highest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting views that economic growth will accelerate in the coming months, driven by more fiscal stimulus and an improving public health situation.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers were fairly upbeat about the labor market, with a measure of household employment rebounding after declining in February. Restrictions on non-essential businesses are being rolled back as more Americans get vaccinated against COVID-19.
That, along with the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, has led economists to predict the economy will this year experience it best performance in nearly four decades. The survey showed more consumers intended to buy homes, cars and household appliances over the next six months.
""Consumers finally are fully on board with the pending expansion,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""What remains to be seen is how quickly services industries such as travel and leisure will open up, allowing venues for consumers to release their pent-up demand.""
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index jumped 19.3 points to a reading of 109.7 this month, the highest level since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. The increase was the largest since April 2003. Confidence remains well below its lofty reading of 132.6 in February 2020. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would rise to 96.9.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, soared to a reading of 110.0 from 89.6 last month. The expectations index, based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions increased to 109.6 from a reading of 90.9 in February.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were largely lower.
INFLATION WORRIES
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rebounded to a reading of 7.8 this month from -0.8 in February. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. 
That fits in with expectations for a sharp acceleration in job growth this month. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 639,000 jobs in March after rising by 379,000 in February. The government is due to publish its closely-watched employment report for March on Friday.
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income over the next six months rose to 15.5% from 14.8% last month. The proportion anticipating a drop increased to 13.3% from 12.9% in February. More consumers expected to purchase homes, motor vehicles and major household appliances compared to February.
Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months increased to 6.7% from 6.5% in February.
""Consumers' renewed optimism boosted their purchasing intentions for homes, autos and several big-ticket items,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board. ""However, concerns of inflation in the short-term rose, most likely due to rising prices at the pump, and may temper spending intentions in the months ahead.""
The rise in house-buying intentions suggests demand for homes could remain strong and continue to drive up prices as supply remains tight. The housing market is being powered by demand for more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. It remains strong despite a rise in mortgage rates this year.

A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index soared 11.1% in January from a year ago, the fastest in 15 years, after increasing 10.2% in December.
""A wave of eager buyers is being forced to act swiftly and face heightened competition for the few homes available,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. ""The combined dynamic is pushing prices upward at their strongest pace in years, and it doesn't appear that there is an end in sight.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Producer prices in Brazil rose in February at their fastest rate since comparable records began seven years ago, figures showed on Tuesday, intensifying ""stagflation"" pressures in an economy struggling with rising interest rates, a weak currency and a rampant COVID-19 pandemic.
The monthly and annual rates of factory gate inflation in Latin America's largest economy jumped to 5.2% and 28.6%, respectively, both the highest since statistics agency Ibex's data series began in January 2014.
Prices rose in each of the four main categories surveyed and 23 of the 24 activities surveyed, led by a 27.9% surge in mining costs on the month, which accounted for around a third of the overall rise.
Oil refining and alcohol production costs rose 12.1% on the month, accounting for over a percentage point of the broader monthly increase, BILGE said.
On an annual basis, the biggest rise in February was a 87.6% spike in mining industry inflation, IBGE said. But food price inflation contributed to nearly 8 percentage points or more than a quarter of the overall annual rise.

The central bank this month raised interest rates by 75 basis points to 2.75% - the first increase in six years and the biggest in over a decade - because consumer price inflation expectations are rising above the bank's central year-end target of 3.75%.

The European Commission's monthly survey showed economic sentiment (ESI) in the 19 countries sharing the euro jumped to 101 points in March from 93.4 in February, beating economists forecasts of a rise to 96 points.
""For the first time since the outbreak of COVID-19 on the continent, the ESI is ... slightly above its long-term average,"" the Commission said. ""The increases were of a magnitude not seen since last summer's steep recovery following the first phase of the pandemic.""
The Commission said that among the largest EU economies, Germany stood out with the largest monthly sentiment improvement on record of +7.9 points to 103.7 points. 
Optimism surged in all categories, with industry sentiment improving to 2.0 from -3.1 and in services, the largest sector in the euro zone economy, rising to -9.3 from -17.0.
Consumer optimism rose to -10.8 from -14.8 and in retail to -12.2 from -19.1. Construction and financial services showed strong improvements too.

The INSEE stats agency said its monthly consumer sentiment index rose to its highest level since December to reach 94 points from 91 in February. 
Economists polled by Reuters had on average expected the indicator to remain unchanged.
The improvement came even though the government tightened restrictions on Paris and much of northern France during the month in the face of steadily rising COVID-19 case numbers.
Households were their least pessimistic about prospects for the general economic situation since March 2020, when the pandemic was beginning to spread. Concerns about unemployment were at their lowest since April last year.
Despite their improving confidence, households indicated they were more inclined to save extra cash than spend it. The measure of savings intentions was at its highest since the survey began in 1972.
Unable to spend at stores, restaurants and venues closed by coronavirus restrictions, households have built up huge extra savings during the crisis which the central bank expects to reach 165 billion euros ($194 billion) by year end, or nearly 8% of gross domestic product.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail sales fell for the third straight month in February as households kept a lid on expenditure amid the coronavirus emergency, underscoring the fragile nature of the economy's recovery from last year's slump.
Analysts expect Japan's economy sharply contracted in the first quarter, as lacklustre consumer spending and weakening exports create challenges for policymakers who have already rolled out massive stimulus.
Retail sales lost 1.5% in February from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, a smaller fall than the median market forecast for a 2.8% drop.
But it marked the third straight month of declines following January's 2.4% fall and a 0.2% drop in December.
""That the coronavirus isn't subsiding is a major reason to worry about a delay of an economic recovery,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
""Clothes aren't selling because people aren't going out,"" he said. ""People are not really returning to commercial facilities, the trend is for them to go shopping at supermarkets in their neighbourhoods.""
The broader decline in retail sales was driven by falls in spending on items such as clothing, toiletries and general merchandise, the data showed.
Compared with the previous month, retail sales rose 3.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Separate data showed the nationwide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was steady at 2.9%, lower than the median forecast of 3.0%.
There were 1.09 jobs per applicant in February, down from the previous month's 1.10, labour ministry data showed. 
The world's third-largest economy is set to contract by an annualised 6.0% in the current quarter, which would be the first decline in three quarters partly due to sagging consumer spending, according to the latest Reuters poll data.

Some analysts are worried that a longer contraction in household spending and weakening exports raise the prospect of a slower economic recovery than initially thought.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to edge up to 51.2 for March from 50.6 in February, according to the median forecast of 30 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
""The key driver (in March PMI) is likely to be continued resilience in external demand, as shown by Korea's daily exports in the first 20 days of March, which accelerated to 6.5% on a 2Y CAGR basis vs. 5.2% for full month of February,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) wrote in a report last week. 
""This would boost export orders and production."" 
Analysts at Industrial Bank in Shanghai attributed the acceleration to more working days in March and an earlier than usual resumption of business at Chinese factories this year. 
Millions of workers who normally travel home over the Lunar New Year holiday had stayed put this year due to COVID-19 fears. That kept factories humming over the period.
China has successfully curbed the domestic transmission of the COVID-19 virus in northern China, leading to quarantine restrictions and testing requirements being scaled back as life returns to normal. 
Beijing has set an annual economic growth target at above 6% this year, below analyst expectations, to allow room for uncertainties and a response to changes. Premier Li Keqiang has warned against any sharp turn in policy making.
The official manufacturing PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on services will both be released on Wednesday.

Budget Minister Maria Jesus Montero told a news conference on Monday the deficit had widened to the equivalent of 10.97% of gross domestic product in 2020 from 2.9% in 2019, and said the government would reduce the deficit this year. 
The budget gap was narrower than the government's latest official target, which stood at 11.3% of GDP.
Excluding the roughly 10-billion-euro ($11.78 billion) hit from the recent reclassification of Spain's SAREB 'bad bank' as a public entity, the deficit was 10.09% of GDP.
""The deficit increase doesn't imply the government has renounced the principle and benefit of budget stability,"" she said. ""The priority will still be the pandemic, but that will not prevent us from reducing the deficit in 2021."" 
Public spending increased by around 53 billion euros in 2020, Montero said, with some 85% of the total aimed at mitigating the effects of the pandemic. 
""Never before has the state made an effort on this scale,"" Montero said.
The government's ERTE furlough scheme helped cushion the blow to the labour market and kept a lot of companies from going bust - preventing a scenario that would have been even more devastating for government revenues, she said.
Tax revenues fell around 8% in 2020.
Spain's national government shouldered the vast majority of the pandemic costs, while regional governments reduced their deficits by an average of nearly 70%, with nine authorities ending the year in surplus.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The fall in Brazilian services sector confidence accelerated in March to its lowest since June last year, a survey showed on Monday, as the deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic darkened the outlook for businesses and consumers.
The Getulio Vargas Foundation's (FGV) services sector confidence index fell 5.6 points to 77.6 points in March, the third consecutive decline and the lowest since June's 71.7. 
The index remains well above last April's record low 51.5, but on the other hand it is falling further below the pre-pandemic level of 94.4 in February last year.
""The picture is still highly uncertain, making it difficult to envision a recovery in the coming months as long as there is no acceleration in the vaccination process and improvement in the pandemic numbers,"" FGV economist Rodolpho Tobler said.
Services account for around 70% of all economic activity in Brazil. A recovery in the sector will be crucial to sustaining wider economic growth.
The expectations index fell more than the current conditions index in March, FGV said, suggesting no imminent turnaround.

A trade agreement between London and Brussels that came into force on Jan. 1 has caused disruption and delays for some companies having to deal with new bureaucracy and rules. 
In the survey by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), 30 out of 132 exporters said they had stopped sales to the European Union temporarily, while five reported having done so permanently.
Just over one in 10 said they had set up, or were thinking of establishing, a presence within an EU country, the research, conducted between March 1 and 15, showed. 
""Those that do business internationally are being hit with some incredibly demanding, unfamiliar paperwork,"" said FSB National Chairman Mike Cherry. 
""What we hoped would prove to be teething problems are in danger of becoming permanent, systemic ones.""
The government has previously said that some issues were temporary as it sought to resolve problems.
British goods exports to the EU, excluding non-monetary gold and other precious metals, slumped by a record 40.7% in January compared with December, while imports fell by 28.8%, the Office for National Statistics said this month.
In response to those figures, David Frost, who was Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator, said the ""unique combination of factors made it inevitable that we would see some unusual figures"". 

COVID-19 and stockpiling have also affected trade flows.

Data from China, set to be published on Wednesday, will probably show a rebound in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors, supporting the broader backdrop of improving global growth. Meantime, the developing world’s better corporate outlook may lure investors to buy the dip.
Last week, MSCI Inc.’s developing-nation stock index slumped amid declines in Turkey, Argentina and China. A selloff in the Turkish lira sent emerging-market currencies to their fifth loss in six weeks, and dollar bonds also edged lower. The recent weakness is encouraging stock-picking in some developing nations that are poised to rebound. Strategists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). tout attractive valuations in South Africa and Russia while others favor China.
“The pickup in U.S. yields, the slightly stronger U.S. dollar and Europe’s hapless vaccination rollout have hurt EM, but valuations are again looking interesting in China technology,” said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer in Dubai. “And for those prepared to look beyond Covid disruption, commodity exporters and tourist destinations offer great opportunities.”
One of the lingering questions for emerging-market investors is whether the meltdown in Turkey worsens or spills over into other countries. So far, the contagion has been limited. There’s also the ongoing drama in the Suez Canal, which could weigh on oil markets for days to come.

FDI has been a key driver of Vietnam's economic growth. Companies with investment from foreign firms account for about 70% of the southeast Asian country's exports.
FDI pledges — which indicate the size of future FDI disbursements — rose 18.5% from a year earlier to $10.13 billion in the January-March period, the government said in a statement.
Of the pledges, 49.6% would go to manufacturing and processing, while 38.9% are to be invested in electricity distribution, it added.

Singapore was the top source of FDI pledges in the period, followed by Japan and South Korea.

Profits stood at 1.114 trillion yuan ($170.31 billion) in the first two months of 2021, up 179% from the same period last year when the COVID-19 pandemic paralysed economic activity, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Saturday.
They were also up 72.1% from the 2019 levels, bringing the two-year average growth to 31.2%, according to NBS. Profits had risen 20.1% in December. 
The figures combine data for January and February to exclude distortions caused by the week-long Lunar New Year, which fell in February in 2021. 
""Due to a combination of factors such as stabilising domestic and foreign demand, low bases and the 'stay put' initiative over the Lunar New Year, growth in industrial production and sales quickened, the rebound in corporate revenues and profits accelerated and profitability has recovered significantly,"" Zhu Hong, senior statistician of NBS, said in a statement accompanying the data.
Millions of workers who normally travel home over the Lunar New Year holiday had stayed put this year due to COVID-19 fears. That kept factories humming over the period.
Margins in the raw material manufacturing sector rose 346% from a year earlier, data showed, as factory-gate prices accelerated at their fastest pace in more than two years.
China's industrial output surged in the first two months of the year, while exports, a major growth driver for China after the pandemic shock, rose at a record pace in February.
China managed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic before many of its peers last year, making it the only major economy to have posted full-year growth in 2020, with an expansion of 2.3%.
Beijing has set a modest annual economic growth target at above 6% this year, well below analyst expectations, with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang saying that setting hugely different growth targets from year to year would ""disturb market expectations.
Liabilities at industrial firms were up 9.4% year-on-year at end-February, versus 6.1% growth as of end-2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer spending fell by the most in 10 months in February as a cold snap gripped many parts of the country and the boost from a second round of stimulus checks to middle- and lower-income households faded.
But the drop in consumer spending, the biggest since mandatory shutdowns of nonessential businesses like restaurants last April to slow the spread of COVID-19, is seen as temporary. The economy is poised to log its best performance in 37 years, thanks to the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package and increased vaccinations against the coronavirus.
""The February pullback in income and spending is only a temporary blip,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""We expect the combination of rising vaccination rates and a new round of stimulus checks from the largest COVID-19 stimulus package yet will provide a powerful lift to consumer spending in March."" 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, dropped 1.0% last month amid a broad decline in purchases of goods, the Commerce Department said on Friday. That followed a 3.4% rebound in January.
Personal income tumbled 7.1% after surging 10.1% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would decrease 0.7% in February and income would decline 7.3%.
Unusually harsh weather in the second half of February, including in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, depressed homebuilding, production at factories, orders and shipments of manufactured goods. 
Temperatures are rising and the relief package approved this month is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extending the government safety net for the unemployed through Sept. 6. The labor market recovery is also gaining traction, with first-time applications for unemployed benefits hitting a one-year low last week.
The brightening health and economic outlook boosted consumers' spirits, which bodes well for spending. In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index increased this month by the most in nearly eight years. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of other currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
BROAD DECLINE
Last month, spending on goods dropped 3.0%, led by declines in purchases of pharmaceutical products and recreational items. Spending on services edged up 0.1% as consumers spent more on utilities and health care at hospitals, offsetting a decrease in outlays at restaurants.
With demand soft, inflation retreated. But prices are expected to accelerate owing to the broader re-opening of the economy and the dropping of last year's weak readings from the calculation, as well as very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers this week that the anticipated rise in inflation over the course of the year will be ""neither particularly large nor persistent.""
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy component gained 0.1% after rising 0.2% in January. In the 12 months through February, the so-called core PCE price index climbed 1.4% after increasing 1.5% in January. The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target, a flexible average.
""Although inflation will move somewhat higher, it will remain well-contained over the next few years,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""There is still a lot of slack in the economy."" 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending decreased 1.2% last month after jumping 3.0% in January. Despite the drop in so-called real consumer spending, consumption in the first two months of the first quarter is running well above the fourth quarter average.
A 2.5% increase in the goods trade deficit to $86.7 billion in February, the second highest on record, reported by the Commerce Department in another report on Friday, did nothing to dampen enthusiasm about economic growth this quarter. 
The report also showed wholesale inventories gaining 0.5% last month and stocks at retailers unchanged.
With latest data in hand, economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised their first-quarter gross domestic product estimate to a 10.0% annualized rate from a 8.7% pace. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.

Income last month was depressed by a 27.4% plunge in government transfers. Wages were also flat. The saving rate fell to a still-high 13.6% from 19.8% in January, with economists expecting some of the cash from the latest stimulus checks will be saved. Households are sitting on about $1.9 trillion in excess savings.
""We anticipate that hoard will surpass $2 trillion once the latest round of direct checks hits household income in March and April,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""This will provide households with ample means to drive spending, not only as the economy re-opens this year, but into next year as well.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's balance of payments position improved in February, figures showed on Friday, as the current account deficit as a share of the economy shrank to its smallest in 13 years and billions of dollars of corporate and financial investment poured into the country.
The current account deficit of 0.48% of gross domestic product in the 12 months to February was down from 0.64% the previous month and the smallest since February 2008, central bank figures showed.
Graphic: Brazil current account - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvodekrpd/CURRACC.png
Foreign direct investment (FDI) totaled $9 billion, the highest monthly inflow since August 2019, while investors plowed $3.6 bln into Brazilian stocks and bonds, the ninth consecutive month of net portfolio inflows.
Graphic: Brazil FDI flows - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbgwaqpq/FDI.png
The current account deficit in the month was $2.3 bln, in line with the median forecast of a $2.4 bln shortfall in a Reuters poll of economists. That was down from a $4.7 bln deficit a year ago.
The figures for February come a day after the central bank revised its 2021 current account forecast to a $2 bln surplus from a $19 bln deficit. That would be Brazil's first annual surplus since recording a slender $408 million surplus in 2007.
The $9 bln FDI inflow in February was more than the $6.1 bln forecast in a Reuters poll, and sharply up from $2.6 bln the same month last year, the central bank said.
Based on partial data so far for March, the central bank expects FDI totaling $7 bln this month and a current account deficit of $1.3 bln. On Thursday the central bank maintained its expectations for $60 billion FDI inflows this year.
Net portfolio investments into Brazil totaled $3.6 bln in February, the ninth consecutive month of inflows, the central bank said. Of that, $822 mln went into stocks and $2.8 bln into debt securities.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales partly recovered in February, helped by locked-down consumers getting outdoor furniture in preparation for small garden parties and couples buying Valentine's Day dinners at home rather than in restaurants.
Sales volumes increased by a monthly 2.1% - in line with a Reuters poll of economists - after a plunge of more than 8% in January when England went back into a lockdown and the rest of the United Kingdom was also under tough restrictions.
Retail sales were down 3.7% compared with February 2020, before the pandemic struck most Western economies, with many non-essential retailers still closed. Clothing retailers saw sales plunge by more than half on their pre-pandemic level.
But many retailers have found ways to soften the blow of the latest lockdown by improving or opening online shopping operations.
The Office for National Statistics said the share of shopping done online reached a record high 36.1%. 
""It’s worth saying that overall sales are down 'only' around 4% on pre-virus levels, a marked improvement on what we saw last spring,"" ING economist James Smith said.
""Experience of lockdowns also tells us that it will probably only take a matter of weeks for sales to return - or exceed - pre-virus levels once the shops re-open."" 
The ONS said February's recovery from January, when sales slumped by 8.2% from December, was helped by increased shopping at budget-end department stores that were allowed to stay open because they sold food.
""Household goods also fared well, with feedback suggesting spending on home improvement and outdoor products boosted sales as consumers prepared for an easing of lockdown restrictions,"" ONS statistician Jonathan Athow said.
Home improvement retailers such as B&Q and Wickes have performed strongly during the crisis. On Monday, B&Q owner  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) reported a 44% jump in full-year profit and a strong start to its new financial year.
The Bank of England says the degree to which households spend the savings they have accumulated while they were stuck at home will determine the speed of Britain's recovery from its worst economic shock in more than three centuries.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to allow groups of up to six people to meet in gardens from March 29. Non-essential retailers are expected to re-open on April 12.
On Thursday, a survey by the Confederation of British Industry showed retailers suffered another difficult month in March but expectations for sales for the month ahead turned positive for the first time since December 2019. 

James Sproule, a Handelsbanken economist, said online sales would probably stay high after the lockdown at about 30% of all sales, ""meaning that the progress towards online buying, previously expected to take place over the next decade, has been achieved in just 12 months.""

651,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 26, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>",China’s Central Bank Estimates Potential Growth of Under 6%,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s central bank estimated the maximum the economy can expand without fueling inflation, known as the potential growth rate, is under 6% in the next five years.
In a working paper released Thursday, the statistics department of the People’s Bank of China said potential growth was projected at 5%-5.7% in the period covering the government’s latest five-year plan through 2025. That represents an overall “medium to high” growth rate, it said.
Potential output measures the maximum sustainable expansion of gross domestic product without causing inflation. The objective of monetary policy should be to match actual output with potential, and the support of monetary policy to the real economy should be in line with the expansion of potential GDP, according to the paper.
China’s official growth target for 2021 is “above 6%,” though economists predict much higher expansion of more than 8%, partly because of last year’s low base during the pandemic.
The PBOC’s paper points out that traditional large-scale fiscal and monetary stimulus policy won’t be able to lift real GDP growth above potential. Such stimulus would only lead to inflation and a rapid increase in the debt ratio, causing systemic risks to the economy, it said.
The central bank is seeking to dial back the stimulus it pumped into the economy last year, concerned by the build up in debt and the risk of asset bubbles.
At its quarterly meeting this week, the PBOC’s monetary policy committee reiterated its stance of keeping policy flexible and appropriate. However, a statement released Thursday after the meeting omitted previous phrasing used by the PBOC of “no sharp turn” in policy, suggesting policy makers are giving themselves more room to act if needed.
Chen Xi, a fixed income analyst at Pacific Securities, wrote in a note that the shift in language could mean the PBOC is taking a more flexible approach to policy fine-tuning based on current economic conditions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Core consumer prices in Japan's capital city Tokyo continued to fall in March though slowed their annual pace of decline for a third consecutive month, indicating that rising fuel cost and a rebound in domestic demand will help Japan avert deflation.
The data may offer relief for the Bank of Japan as it seeks to fire up inflation to its 2% target, though the rising cost of living could weigh on consumption as wage growth stays weak.
The core consumer price index for Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide inflation, fell 0.1% in March from the same month a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, less than a median market forecast decline of 0.2%.
That followed a 0.3% fall in February and compared with the steepest recent decline of 0.9% in December, with the data signalling a rebound in oil and commodities costs underpinning prices.
Gasoline prices, for instance, rose 2.1% on year in March after falling 5.2% in February.
Prices of household appliances rose 7.0% in March, up from a 4.0% gain in February, suggesting a pick-up in consumption. Hotel accommodation fees stopped falling in March after sliding 5.1% in February, the data showed.
Japan's economy is widely expected to suffer a contraction in the current quarter as renewed curbs introduced in January to prevent the spread of COVID-19 weighed on consumption.

While the curbs have ended, analysts expect any rebound in the economy to be modest and heavily reliant on overseas demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits dropped to a one-year low last week, providing a powerful boost to an economy on the verge of stronger growth as the public health situation improves and temperatures rise.
But the labor market is not out of the woods yet, with the weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday showing a staggering 18.953 million people were still receiving unemployment checks in early March. It will likely take years for a full recovery from the pandemic's scarring.
President Joe Biden in his first press conference highlighted the brightening economic outlook and drop in claims to their lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic barreled across the United States just over a year ago.
""There are still too many Americans out of work, too many families are hurting and I still have a lot of work to do,"" Biden said. ""But I can say to you the American people, help is here and hope is on the way."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits tumbled 97,000 to a seasonally adjusted 684,000 for the week ended March 20, the lowest since mid-March. Data for the prior week was revised to show 11,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 730,000 applications for the latest week. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 898,534 people filed claims last week, dropping below one million for the first time since the pandemic started. 
The decline was led by Ohio, which has been dogged by fraud, and Illinois. Claims shot up in the second week of March, likely as backlogs after severe winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region were processed. 
The deep freeze in the second half of February, which also gripped other parts of the country, depressed retail sales, homebuilding, production at factories, orders and shipments of manufactured goods last month. 
Warmer weather, passage of the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package and increased vaccinations are expected to boost activity beginning March. 
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck an optimistic note on the economy in testimony before lawmakers this week.
U.S. stocks were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
CORPORATE PROFITS FALL
But the massive fiscal stimulus, which extended government-funded unemployment aid, including a $300 weekly supplement, through Sept. 6, could keep claims elevated as some people reapply for benefits. Claims surged to a record 6.867 million in March 2020. They remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.
Employment is 9.5 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. Economists say it could take at least two years for the economy to recover all of the 22.4 million jobs lost in March and April last year. 
Full labor market recovery could take even longer, with the labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, near a 47-year low. More than 4 million workers have dropped out of the labor force since February 2020.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 264,000 to 3.870 million in the week ended March 13. More people are finding work, while others are exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.
About 5.6 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended March 6. Another 1.1 million were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed gross domestic product increased at a 4.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, revised up from the 4.1% pace reported last month. 
Goods-producing industries grew at a 6.1% rate, supported by gains in construction and the manufacturing of computer and electronic products as well as fabricated metal products.
Services industries expanded at a 4.9% pace, partly driven by finance and insurance, health care and social assistance, and professional, scientific and technical services. They were partially offset by decreases in accommodation and food services, utilities and educational services.
Government contracted at a 1.1% rate. Seventeen out of 22 industries contributed to fourth-quarter GDP growth. The economy grew at a record 33.4% rate in the third quarter. 
Profits fell $31.4 billion last quarter after increasing $499.6 billion in the July-September period. They plunged $130.2 billion in 2020 after rising $7.6 billion in 2019.

The worst is likely over, with the economy forecast to grow by as much as a 7.5% rate in the first quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.
""We believe there is ample room for corporate profits to rise as company revenues pick up markedly and margins remain well supported,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Improving health conditions, expanding vaccine distribution, and generous fiscal stimulus will form a powerful growth cocktail.""

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market’s healing process appeared to pick up speed last week, as the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell to its lowest level in almost a year.
The Department of Labor said that initial jobless claims fell to 684,000 from 781,000 the previous week. Last week’s figure was revised up slightly from an initial estimate of 770,000.
The number of continuing claims also fell by some 260,000 to 3.87 million, its lowest since March last year.
The data on continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims.
That is also true of the broader dataset that covers all people claiming unemployment-related benefit claims. That dataset showed a less positive development, with the overall number of claimants rising by 734,000 to 18.95 million.  
""The gentle downward trend in place since late January is intact,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in emailed comments.  However, he warned the pace of gross layoffs remains alarmingly high, above the 655,000 peak seend after the 2008 crash.
""The rate of gross job losses, presumably concentrated in the consumer services sector, remains depressingly rapid.  We’re guessing that each week sees some firms either downsizing further or throwing in the towel, unable to hang on until the economy reopens,"" Shepherdson said, adding that ""this gradual attrition should not last much longer: we expect claims to fall sharply as the economy reopens fully across the second quarter.""
The numbers were released at the same time as the government issued its final reading for economic growth in the fourth quarter. Gross domestic product growth was revised up slightly to an annualized rate of 4.3% from 4.1%, but the more important development was arguably a sharp slowdown in prices for core personal expenditures, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation. Core PCE prices rose only 1.3% on the year in the fourth quarter, below expectations for 1.4%. However, the third-quarter's data were revised up to a gain of 3.4%. "

The GfK research institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, rose to -6.2 points from a revised -12.7 in March.
That was the best result since November, when a partial lockdown to contain a second wave of infections began, and clearly beat a Reuters forecast of -11.9.
Income expectation jumped to 22.3 points compared to 6.5 points in the previous month. This was in line with a survey by the Ifo institute and the Randstad employment services firm, which showed that a majority of personnel directors at German companies expected wages to rise in 2021.
The survey took place from March 3 to March 15, which was before Germany extended its lockdown until April 18 and a temporary suspension of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 shots following reports of possible serious side-effects.
The second lockdown, which was tightened in mid-December, is forcing most shops and services to close. Restaurants, bars and entertainment venues have been shut since early November.
""Another hard lockdown will seriously damage the consumer climate and the current improvement will remain a flash in the pan,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said.
A sustained recovery in consumer sentiment will continue to be a long time coming, which means difficult times for retailers and manufacturers, Buerkl said.
The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.
An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop compared with the same period a year ago.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1% in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""
The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.
The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

""While the February figures have disappointed, there is nothing to be too concerned by,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Consumer spending is expected to rebound strongly in March and April on the latest stimulus payments, manufacturing will roar back given the strong order books and low inventory levels.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, dropped 0.8% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders gained 0.6% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders would rise 0.5%. 
Core capital goods orders surged 8.5% on a year-on-year basis in February. The year-long coronavirus pandemic has boosted demand for goods, underpinning manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
A survey from data firm IHS Markit on Wednesday showed its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 59 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 58.6 in February. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing. The survey's new orders measure jumped to the highest since June 2014.
But manufacturing is struggling with supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic.
U.S. stocks were trading largely higher. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices also rose.
BROAD WEAKNESS
In February, core capital goods orders were weighed down by machinery and primary and fabricated metal products, as well computers and electronic products. But orders for electrical equipment, appliances and components rose 0.2%. 
Shipments of core capital goods dropped 1.0% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement. They increased 1.9% in January. 
Last month's decline suggests a slowdown in business investment on equipment this quarter after double-digit growth in each of the last two quarters. 
The economy is forecast to grow by as much as a 7.5% annualized rate in the first quarter after expanding at a 4.1% pace in the final three months of 2020. 
""The simple reality is that the economy is in good shape and almost everything is moving in the right direction,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""The stimulus is hitting consumer bank accounts, vaccinations are ramping up and, at least until recently, virus cases and especially deaths were trending downward.""
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, decreased 1.1% in February after jumping 3.5% in January. They were pulled down by a 1.6% drop in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 7.5% surge in January.
But orders for civilian aircraft soared 103.3%. Boeing (NYSE:BA) reported on its website that it had received 82 aircraft orders last month compared to only four in January. That included 39 orders for the 737 MAX jets. The U.S. government late last year lifted a 20-month grounding of the aircraft that was put in place after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts tumbled 8.7% in February after falling 0.9% in January. Motor vehicle production has been hit by a global semiconductor chip shortage. Output of computers and electronic products also has been impacted. 

""The biggest headwinds for manufacturing as we emerge from this pandemic are mostly about manufacturers getting the stuff they need,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The downside of that is price pressures and the potential for profit squeeze.""
Indeed, the IHS survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers raced to a 10-year high early this month, amid what the data firm said was the ""most severe supply chain disruption on record."" It said firms ""commonly reported slower output growth"" due to raw materials shortages.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity picked up in early March amid strong growth in new orders, but supply chain disruptions because of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to exert cost pressures for manufacturers, which could keep inflation fears in focus. 
Data firm IHS Markit said on Wednesday its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI increased to 59 in the first half of this month from a final reading 58.6 in February, when activity took a step back after a cold snap hit large parts of the country.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 59.3 in early March. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. The year-long pandemic has boosted demand for goods.
Factories and their suppliers are, however, struggling to find workers, leading to shortages that are driving up prices for production materials. A global semiconductor chip shortage has forced some automobile manufacturers to cut production. 
The IHS Markit survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers raced to a 10-year high early this month, amid what the data firm said was the ""most severe supply chain disruption on record."" It said firms ""commonly reported slower output growth"" due to raw materials shortages.
The relentless rise in input costs is one of several factors expected to drive inflation above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target this year. 
A broader reopening of the economy as more Americans get vaccinated against the coronavirus is expected to lead to price hikes, especially in the services sector. There are concerns that the White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package and the U.S. central bank's extremely accommodative monetary policy stance could cause the economy to overheat.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly pushed back against fears of higher inflation becoming sustained. Powell told lawmakers on Tuesday that the anticipated rise over the course of the year, will be ""neither particularly large nor persistent.""
The IHS survey's new orders measure jumped early this month to the highest since June 2014. 
Though the pace of hiring at factories slowed, that was because of a dearth of workers. The survey showed ""many firms highlighted struggles finding suitable candidates to fill vacancies.""
Growth in the services industry is also gaining traction. The IHS Markit's flash services sector PMI climbed to 60 this month, the highest since July 2014, from a final reading of 59.8 in February. That likely reflected broader economic re-engagement amid an acceleration in the pace of inoculations.
The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has borne the brunt of the pandemic.

Overall business activity, however, slipped early this month as input shortages and supplier delays limited manufacturing production capacity. The survey's flash composite PMI output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, dipped 59.1 from a final a reading of 59.5 in February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Surging new orders before an easing of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions has prompted a stronger rebound for British companies than expected this month, although price pressures are rising sharply, too, a business survey showed on Wednesday.
The flash IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seven-month high of 56.6 in March from 49.6 in February. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a reading of 51.1.
Britain's economy shrank by 10% last year - its sharpest decline in more than 300 years - and earlier this month government budget forecasters predicted it would take until the middle of next year before it regains its pre-pandemic size.
But confidence among British businesses had been bolstered by Britain's swift roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, one factor behind the first increase in employment since the start of the pandemic, the survey showed.
Services in Britain enjoyed a rapid recovery, in contrast to those in the euro zone. They saw another month of contraction as many countries re-entered lockdown to stem a third wave of COVID-19. They're also struggling with their vaccination programmes.
""The rise in the (UK) composite PMI in March is probably a taste of things to come over the next few months as retail and hospitality firms are allowed to open again,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy. 
""This gives us more confidence in our view that the economy will have regained its pre-pandemic level by early next year.""
The survey is likely to bolster confidence among Bank of England officials that the economy is on track for a swift recovery. IHS Markit said its survey pointed to robust growth in the second quarter.
The PMI does not cover British retailers, but separate figures from market research company GfK on Friday showed consumer sentiment was the strongest in over a year, again largely based on recovery hopes. Another survey on Wednesday, from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) also found the highest level of consumer confidence for a year. 
But companies still face difficulties - not least in the form of rising costs.
The PMI's gauge of company input prices rose to a more than four-year high in March, with manufacturers citing increased costs from a global shipping shortage and customs delays.
Official data for February released on Wednesday also showed accelerating costs pressures for British factories, although consumer price inflation unexpectedly fell during the month.

The factory PMI rose to its highest since November 2017 at 57.9 in March but was flattered by the way the survey interprets supply chain disruption. The services PMI rose to a seven-month high of 56.8 from 49.5 last month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity unexpectedly grew this month, a preliminary survey showed, but with much of Europe suffering a third wave of coronavirus infections and renewed lockdown measures, that may not last through April. 
Factories ramped up output at the fastest monthly pace in over 23 years, countering a continuing slowdown in the currency bloc's dominant services industry, which is far more vulnerable to lockdowns and the region's slow vaccine rollout.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, bounced above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, to 52.5 in March compared to February's 48.8, its highest since late 2018. 
Even the most optimistic respondent in a Reuters poll had forecast it would rise to 51.0, while the median predicted only a modest increase to 49.1.
""March's rise in the euro zone composite PMI pushed it back above the 50 mark for the first time in six months, but the recent tightening of restrictions in a number of countries suggests that the improvement will not be sustained,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
Indicating Europe's largest economy was so far shrugging off pandemic lockdowns, German factory activity rose to a record high and the services sector expanded after five successive months of contractions.
In France, the 19-country euro zone's second-largest economy, activity held up better than expected, with manufacturing surging ahead at the fastest pace in more than three years.
A rush of new orders in anticipation of an easing of lockdown restrictions, and Britain's swift roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, also prompted a much stronger rebound for British companies, who are outside the euro zone and the European Union.
DIVERGENCE
A flash PMI covering the euro zone services industry rose to 48.8 from February's 45.7, still in contractionary territory but its highest reading since August, and well above the median expectation in a Reuters poll for 46.0.
A big jump in input costs led services firms to increase their prices for the first time in just over a year. The output prices index climbed to 50.8 from 48.1.
Any sign of increasing price pressures may be welcomed by the European Central Bank, which has struggled to get inflation anywhere near its target, but a Reuters poll earlier this month suggested the pick-up would be shortlived. 
Meanwhile, booming demand for manufactured goods helped the flash factory PMI soar to 62.4 from 57.9, comfortably the highest reading since the survey began in June 1997 and well above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted 57.7. 
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, jumped to a survey high of 63.0 from 57.6.
The manufacturing upturn was led by a record surge of factory production in Germany, accompanied by the fastest production growth since January 2018 in both France and the region as a whole, IHS Markit noted.
That jump in output came as euro zone factories tried to meet soaring demand, also at a survey high, with the new orders index at 64.2 versus February's 57.8.
""The manufacturing sector seems to be in boom territory at the moment,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
""New orders increased in March, with export orders growing especially quickly, indicating that the euro zone profits from the rest of the world being much more open in this phase of the pandemic.""

Meanwhile, hopes the vaccine programme would accelerate and allow a return to some sort of normal life, optimism remained elevated. The composite future output index only dipped from February's three-year high of 67.0 to 66.8.

660,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 04:35AM ET</span>",March lockdown easing pushes German factory activity to record high: PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German factory activity rose to a record high in March and the services sector expanded after five successive months of contractions, surveys showed on Wednesday, suggesting Europe's largest economy was shrugging off pandemic lockdowns.
IHS Markit's flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of activity in the manufacturing sector shot up to 66.6, the highest reading since the survey started in April 1996. That compared with 60.7 in February and beat a Reuters poll forecast for a reading of 60.8.
The surveys were conducted before Chancellor Angela Merkel's government and leaders of Germany's 16 states decided this week to reimpose strict measures shutting down most businesses until April 18 to try to break a third wave of COVID-19.
The data also pointed to a revival in the services sector, which had suffered under COVID-19 lockdown measures imposed in November and which were eased early this month.
The flash PMI for the services sector rose to a seven-month high of 50.8, up from 45.7 in February.
As a result, the preliminary composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to a 37-month high of 56.8 from 51.1 the previous month.
""The flash PMI pointed to a notable upturn in German business activity in March, with the data therefore hinting at the prospect of a better-than-expected economic performance in the first quarter,"" said Phil Smith, associate director at survey compiler IHS Markit. 
""The result owed to a combination of survey record growth in manufacturing output and a better performance from services, where some firms benefited from the slight easing of lockdown restrictions.""
But the picture was not all rosy, he added, pointing to supply chain pressures in manufacturing which were pushing up input costs at the fastest rate in nearly 25 years. 
""Businesses remain highly optimistic about the outlook over the coming year, with many pinning their hopes on progress in the vaccine rollout,"" said Smith. 

""However, with the 'emergency brake' restrictions coming into effect in April to stem a third wave of infections, the immediate outlook looks less promising.""

661,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2021 04:21AM ET</span>",Slump in clothes prices causes surprise UK inflation dip,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation unexpectedly fell last month, reflecting the biggest annual drop in clothing prices since 2009 and cheaper second-hand cars, toys and computer games, though most economists see sharper price rises ahead.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation dropped to 0.4% in February from 0.7% in January, the Office for National Statistics said, in contrast to economists' average forecast in a Reuters poll of a rise to 0.8%.
""The impact of the pandemic has disrupted standard seasonal patterns,"" ONS Deputy National Statistician Jonathan Athow said. ""A fall in clothing prices helped to ease inflation in February, traditionally a month where we would see these prices rise.""
Sterling weakened slightly against the U.S. dollar after the figures came out.
The Bank of England and others expect inflation to rise sharply back towards the BoE's 2% target in the first half of this year, reflecting higher oil prices, increases in regulated household energy bills and other one-off effects.
""From April we'll also see the headline rate of inflation leap on energy prices, partly because we'll no longer be comparing petrol prices to pre-pandemic levels, but also because the household energy price cap will rise to 9%,"" ING economist James Smith said.
Few economists expect the rise in inflation - which may include a small overshoot of its 2% target - to prompt the British central bank to begin raising interest rates.
Unemployment is forecast to rise later this year when government job support measures end, putting downward pressure on wages and prices for the next year or two. 
Clothing and footwear prices fell between January and February for the first time since 2007 and are 5.7% lower than a year before, the biggest annual decline since November 2009, reflecting a widespread drop in demand due to the pandemic.
Price falls were mostly for women's clothes and shoes. Normally prices steadily rise with the launch of new spring and summer ranges after the January sales.
But high-street clothing retailers were shut across Britain in February due to lockdown restrictions that have closed all non-essential stores.
Children's toys such as dolls and scooters, as well as computer games - where prices fluctuate significantly - were also cheaper, the ONS said.
Prices for second-hand cars, which rose last year as people avoided public transport during the pandemic, fell by 1.8%.

But petrol prices rose by 2.9% and factories' raw materials costs - which tend to feed through into consumer prices later - were 2.6% higher than the year before in February.

On a month-on-month basis, the CPI rose to 0.7% in February from 0.3% in the previous month.

Core inflation, which excludes prices of food, non-alcoholic beverages, fuel and energy, was at 2.6% year-on-year in February, from 3.3% previously. On a month-on-month basis core inflation rose to 0.6% from 0.1% previously.

663,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 10:05PM ET</span>","BOJ debated future scope to assist green, digital investment - January minutes","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan must seek ways to encourage corporate investment to promote digitalisation and a carbon-free society, one of its board members said at a January meeting, suggesting that the idea could emerge as a future policy option.
Meeting for a rate review weeks after the government rolled out fresh curbs to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, BOJ policymakers warned of various risks that cloud their projections of a moderate economic recovery.
Among them was the chance the pandemic could prod firms to put off investment for innovation, minutes of the Jan. 20-21 meeting showed on Wednesday.
""It's important to encourage corporate activities for future growth such as research and development investment, business portfolio reforms, and efforts on digitalisation and decarbonisation,"" one of the members was quoted as saying.
""It's crucial for the BOJ to devise monetary policy means to boost firms' and households' growth expectations by showing its determination to never allow a return to deflation,"" the member said.
Another member, however, said it was ""not easy"" to use monetary policy to address the structural challenges faced by Japan's economy, the minutes showed.
The debate by the nine-member board suggests the BOJ could come up with additional easing steps to assist Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's growth strategy to revitalise the economy.
In December, Suga's administration laid out a growth strategy that put green investment and digitalisation among the top priorities to bolster the economy.
The BOJ board also kicked off discussions in January about a review of its policy tools, aimed at making them sustainable enough to weather a prolonged battle with economic stagnation.
One member said allowing long-term yields to fluctuate more will not hurt the economy much because many corporate borrowing are linked to short-term rates, the minutes showed.
There was no mention in the minutes of the need to keep long-term rates stably low, a comment later made by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.
At the January meeting, the BOJ kept monetary policy steady and upgraded its economic forecast for next fiscal year, but warned of escalating risks to the outlook.

At a subsequent meeting in March, the BOJ slightly loosened its grip on long-term yields but focused on the need to keep borrowing costs low to support the pandemic-ravaged economy.

But the service sector remained much more gloomy, with businesses suffering from the coronavirus pandemic's fallout even after the government lifted a state of emergency in the Tokyo region.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.0 in March from a final 51.4 in February.
That meant manufacturing activity came in above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the second straight month.
The PMI survey showed that activity was helped by growing output and new orders. Future output, which shows firms' growth expectations for the year ahead, also remained strongly positive.
""Positive sentiment stemmed from the expectation that the lifting of state of emergency measures and broader restrictions as vaccinations roll out would trigger a recovery in demand in both domestic and external markets,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
But the survey highlighted pressure on firms from higher input prices, which had already risen sharply in the previous month.
Manufacturers reported input prices were at their highest since November 2018, leading to the widest gap between input and output prices since December 2014.
Despite the expanding output and orders, manufacturers were hesitant to take on workers, reporting the third straight month of job shedding.
The PMI survey also showed the service sector remained pessimistic as fallout of the health crisis persisted, the survey showed.
The au Jibun Bank Flash Services PMI index was in line with the previous month's reading, rising to 46.5 on a seasonally adjusted basis from February's final of 46.3.

The au Jibun Bank Flash Japan Composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, stood at 48.3 in March, largely unchanged from the previous month's final of 48.2.

665,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2021 02:30PM ET</span>",Cold weather chills new U.S. home sales; current account deficit soars in 2020,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to a nine-month low in February amid bitterly cold weather, and expensive lumber and rising mortgage rates could cool the housing market this year. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday followed on the heels of data this month showing a plunge in homebuilding and permits for future construction in February. There has been demand for bigger houses to accommodate home offices and remote schooling as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers. 
But a record jump in lumber prices and labor and land shortages is increasing costs for builders, hampering their ability to ramp up construction. The dearth of homes is boosting house prices, which together with a sustained rise in mortgage rates since February, is making homeownership more expensive for first-time buyers. 
""The residential housing market will continue to support economic growth, but risks are to the downside,"" said Abbey Omodunbi, an economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The run-up in prices and rising mortgage rates will erode affordability and likely weaken demand in 2021."" 
New home sales plunged 18.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 775,000 units last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales would tumble 6.5% to a rate of 875,000 units in February. Though new homes account for a small share of total sales, they are a leading indicator for the housing market as they are counted at the signing of a contract. 
Sales decreased in all four regions. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from single-family building permits, which dropped 10% in February.
Last month's unseasonably cold weather, including severe winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, depressed retail sales, production at factories and homebuilding. Warmer temperatures, an acceleration in the pace of coronavirus vaccinations and the White House's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 pandemic rescue package are expected to spur a sharp rebound in economic activity in March. 
New home sales increased 8.2% on a year-on-year basis in February, benefiting from an acute shortage of previously owned homes. The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that the inventory of existing homes remained stuck at record lows in February. (Graphic: New home sales, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvodzdbpd/nhs.png) 
New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales in the below-$200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 4% of transactions last month.
Stocks on Wall Street slipped. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
EXPENSIVE LUMBER
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to a nine-month high of 3.09%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Mortgage rates have risen in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields, which have spiked in anticipation of stronger economic growth this year and higher inflation from the massive fiscal stimulus. 
The cost of softwood lumber surged a record 79.7% on a year-on-year basis in February. According to the National Association of Home Builders, that was adding about $24,000 to the price of a new home. The median new home house price jumped 5.3% from a year ago to $349,400 in February. 
""Rising mortgage rates will likely soften homebuyer demand modestly, while homebuilder constraints, including the ongoing high prices of lumber and other materials, will likely dampen the supply of new homes,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. ""However, underlying demand remains strong. The extremely tight supply of existing homes for sale may encourage more homebuyers to turn to new home purchases."" 
There were 312,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 304,000 in January. At February's sales pace it would take 4.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 3.8 months in January. About 73% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built. 
Separately on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, surged 34.8% to a 12-year high of $647.2 billion in 2020 as the pandemic severely disrupted exports. (Graphic: Current account, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwoboepw/currentaccount.png) 
The deficit could remain big this year as the stimulus-driven economic recovery draws in imports. The current account gap represented 3.1% of gross domestic product last year, also the largest share since 2008 and up from 2.2% in 2019. The wider deficit is likely not an issue for the United States because of the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency.
""Early 2021 data shows the trade recovery continuing in the first quarter, but it will take time to return to pre-COVID conditions since the pandemic isn't over yet and stretched supply chains are inhibiting progress,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
""Looking ahead, we expect the current account deficit to widen slightly and average 3.5% of GDP in 2021 as positive recovery dynamics and generous fiscal stimulus maintain a strong pull on imports while exports recover more slowly.""

Economic growth this year is expected to top 7%. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer confidence in Brazil registered its third largest monthly fall on record, a survey indicated on Tuesday, hammered by a deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and near collapse of the public health system in several cities.
The Getulio Vargas Foundation's (FGV) consumer confidence index fell 9.8 points to a 10-month low of 68.2 points in March, The current situation index fell 5.5 points and the expectations index tumbled 12.3 points, FGV said.
There have been only two steeper monthly declines since the data series began in 2005: October 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis, and April last year as the first wave of the global pandemic virtually shut down the entire economy.
Graphic: Brazil consumer confidence - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgxzmlpq/conscon.png
""The COVID-19 immunization campaign remains slow, while the number of hospitalizations and deaths per day is advancing rapidly, leading states and municipalities to adopt measures to restrict the movement of people,"" said survey manager Viviane Seda Bittencourt.
""Consumers look at the deteriorating economic situation and see serious risks to their employment and income, and are also affected psychologically by the fear of contracting the disease and the need to socially isolate,"" Bittencourt added.
Barring the all-time lows of April and May last year, consumer confidence in March was the lowest since 2015, when Brazil was a year into a steep two-year economic downturn. 

The fall in confidence was spread across most income brackets, but especially the lowest earners, FGV said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's jobless rate unexpectedly fell in the three months to January, a change that partly reflected people giving up their job hunt as lockdown measures tightened at the start of the year, official figures showed on Tuesday.
The main jobless rate dropped to 5.0% in the three months to January from 5.1% in the final quarter of 2020, in contrast to forecasts in a Reuters poll for a small rise to 5.2%. None of the economists polled had expected a fall.
""The latest labour market data are somewhat mixed but show considerable resilience overall,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at consultants EY ITEM Club.
Part of the drop in the headline unemployment rate was due to high jobless numbers for October alone dropping out of the three-monthly figures.
The drop also reflected an increase in the proportion of the potential workforce classed as 'inactive', such as students, parents looking after their children full time and people who have temporarily given up looking for work.
This 'inactivity rate' rose by 0.3 percentage points over the past three months to 21.0%, its highest since early 2019, while the share of people in employment fell by 0.3 percentage points over the same period, equivalent to a drop of 147,000.
Since January non-essential shops and most businesses open to the public have been closed in England to slow a surge in more infectious variants of COVID, with similar measures in other parts of the United Kingdom.
Last month the government extended furlough support - which currently pays the wages of one in five employees - until the end of September. Without furlough, Britain's jobless rate would be far higher.
A rapid roll-out of vaccinations has sharply reduced new infections and allowed English pupils to return to school this month. Shops are due to reopen next month, but restrictions on hospitality will remain until at least late June. 
Separate official data based on tax records - which some analysts view as more reliable than the main labour force survey - showed the number of employees on company payrolls in February had fallen by 693,000 over the past year.
Almost two thirds of this decline affected workers aged under 25, a majority of the job losses were in hospitality and a third of the total took place in London, the ONS said.
But there has been an upturn more recently with an increase of 68,000 between January and February in the number of workers.
This data also pointed towards a fall of 550,000 in the number of non-UK nationals employed by British companies in the final quarter of 2020 compared with a year earlier.
Previous ONS data from the main labour force survey had pointed towards a fall of around 800,000 or more, although the ONS had said it needed to be interpreted cautiously.

""LFS estimates alone may be significantly overstating the fall in the number of non-UK nationals,"" the ONS said. [

The companies signed up for $7.4 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $6.8 billion a year earlier. But borrowings in February fell 9% from the previous month.
""As vaccine distribution picks up across the country, labor markets improve and interest rates remain low, the U.S. economy will only improve as we move into Q2,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals rose to 76.8% in February, from 76.2% in January.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY).
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, reported monthly confidence index of 67.7 in March, compared with the February reading of 64.4.

670,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2021 02:00PM ET</span>","Cold weather, tight supply depress U.S. home sales","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales dropped to a six-month low in February amid cold weather in many parts of the country and record low supply, and a rebound could be muted by rising mortgage rates as well as higher house prices.
Still, the report from the National Association of Realtors on Monday showed robust demand, with houses only staying on the market for a record-low 20 days last month after being listed. 
The slump in sales did not dampen expectations for robust economic growth in the first quarter as brokers' commissions only account for a fraction of gross domestic product. Growth is seen boosted by the White House's massive $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus and increased vaccinations against COVID-19, which are allowing more parts of the economy to reopen.
""Severe winter weather depressed sales in February,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But pending home sales already had been trending lower before the bad weather; existing home sales also are cooling off following a robust run due to some other factors apart from the weather.""
Existing home sales dropped 6.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.22 million units last month, the lowest level since last August. Sales declined in the Northeast, South and the Midwest, but rose in the West. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would drop 3.0% to a rate of 6.50 million units in February. Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, increased 9.1% on a year-on-year basis, keeping them perched well above their pre-pandemic level. Activity continued to be concentrated in the upper price range of the market.
Bitterly cold weather, including severe winter storms in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, disrupted economic activity last month, depressing retail sales, production at factories and homebuilding.
Warmer temperatures, an acceleration in the pace of coronavirus vaccinations and the massive fiscal stimulus are expected to spur a sharp rebound in activity in March. 
The housing market, however, is seen lagging after being one of the main drivers of the economic recovery from the pandemic as Americans sought bigger and more expensive houses for home offices and remote schooling during the pandemic.

AFFORDABILITY ERODING 
Home resales have been running ahead of contracts. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to a nine-month high of 3.09%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Though mortgage rates remain historically low, the sustained increase since February is contributing to making homeownership more expensive for first-time buyers.
Mortgage rates have risen in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields, which have spiked in anticipation of stronger economic growth this year and higher inflation from the fiscal stimulus.
Growth estimates for the first quarter top a 6% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. It is forecast expanding 7.0% this year. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
The median existing house price jumped 15.8% from a year ago to $313,000 in February. 
Economists, however, do not believe another housing bubble is developing, noting that the surge is being mostly driven by a mismatch between supply and demand, rather than speculation, which triggered the 2008 global financial crisis.
""Demand for homes has been strongest at the upper-end of the price range, where the supply of homes is unusually tight,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We expect price gains to moderate as fears about COVID subside, amid lower case counts and rising vaccinations, and as more homeowners choose to put their homes on the market.""
There were 1.03 million previously owned homes on the market in February, matching January's all-time low. Supply plunged a record 29.5% from one year ago.
Builders are being constrained by record-high lumber prices as well as shortages of land and labor. At February's sales pace, it would take two months to exhaust the current inventory, an all-time low and down from 3.1 months a year ago.
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. Seventy-four percent of homes sold in February were on the market for less than a month. 
According to the NAR, realtors were reporting multiple bids for houses on the market. First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales in February, down from 33% in January and 32% in February 2020. All-cash sales accounted for 22% of transactions.

""A further rise in mortgage interest rates to around 4.0% by the end of the year will help bring sales back toward their pre-COVID trend,"" said Matthew Pointon, senior property economist at Capital Economics in New York.

Russia's commodity-dependent economy is on track to grow this year after shrinking 3.1% in 2020 -- its sharpest contraction in 11 years but still smaller than expected. 
The central bank expects the economy to return to pre-crisis levels before the end of the year, the governor of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, said on Friday after a surprise 25-basis-point rate increase, brought about by rising inflation and geopolitical risks.
The Federal Statistics Service, or Rosstat, said Russia's real wages, which are adjusted for inflation and reported one month later than other key indicators, rose 0.1% year-on-year in January. Analysts on average had forecast they would remain flat.
Economic growth and a recovery in living standards in Russia are a crucial issue for President Vladimir Putin and the United Russian ruling party. The latter is bracing for parliamentary elections in September amid massive protests that rocked Russian streets earlier this year. 
Russia's jobless rate slipped to 5.7% in February from 5.8% in January, in line with the forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.

Retail sales, a barometer of consumer demand that is Russia's main driver of economic growth, underperformed, slipping 1.3% year-on-year in February versus expectations for a 1.1% drop predicted by a Reuters poll.

The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey will likely show the headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment improved to zero in March from minus 10 in December, the poll of 17 economists showed.
That would be the third straight quarter of improvement. 
But big non-manufacturers' pessimism is expected to have remained subdued with the sentiment index likely to at minus 5, in line with the December survey, according to the poll.
""Exports recovery, especially shipments to China, stay-at-home demand and a firm yen helped big-manufacturers' confidence,"" said Tsuyoshi Ueno, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
But emergency curbs to contain the pandemic and rises in raw material costs slammed non-manufacturers' confidence, he added.
Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers forecast business conditions to improve three months ahead, the poll found, suggesting the coronavirus vaccination and lifting of the emergency steps will help economic activity.
Big firms will likely raise their capital spending plans by 1.4% for the business year beginning in April, showing some improvement in appetite for business investment.
The BOJ will announce the Tankan quarterly survey results at 8:50 a.m. on April 1.

The BOJ on Friday widened the band at which it allows long-term interest rates to move around its target, as part of a raft of measures to make its ultra-easy policy more sustainable amid a prolonged battle to fire up inflation.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer morale struck a one-year high this month as the public became increasingly confident that an economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is approaching and that they would benefit directly, a survey showed on Friday.
The monthly consumer confidence index from market research firm GfK rose to -16 from -23 in February. While still some way below the its long-run average of -9, the survey showed rising optimism in all of its components. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller increase to -20. 
The readings came a day after the Bank of England said Britain's economic recovery was gathering pace thanks to the speed of COVID-19 vaccinations. But its policymakers are split over the prospects for longer-term improvement, dampening speculation about a reversal of stimulus.
GfK said household expectations for the economic outlook and personal finances improved rapidly this month, with the latter hitting a three-year high.
""If this improved mood translates into spending, it might help reverse some of the economic damage the UK has suffered,"" GfK client strategy director Joe Staton said. ""The eight-point fillip in our major purchase measure to -11 suggests this may well happen.""
Staton added that further improvement was likely in the coming months.
Britain suffered its worst economic slump in three centuries last year when it shrank by 10%. It has also been hit with Europe's biggest COVID-19 death toll of over 125,000 people.

But the country is racing ahead with vaccinations and many economists expect the economy would shrink by 2% in the first quarter of 2021, half the hit forecast by the BoE only last month.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2021 11:50AM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims increase; mid-Atlantic factory activity near 50-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but the labor market is regaining its footing as an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations leads to more businesses reopening.
The improving health situation, combined with extremely accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, is boosting manufacturing, putting the economy on course for its fastest growth pace in 37 years this year. Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region raced to its highest level in nearly 50 years in March, other data showed on Thursday.
""It is best to look through the weekly ups and downs of initial claims,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The labor market is set for a dramatic improvement through the rest of 2021."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 45,000 to a seasonally adjusted 770,000 for the week ended March 13, from 725,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 13,000 more applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 700,000 applications in the latest week. The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 16,000 to 746,250 last week, a four-month low. This measure has been decreasing since February.
""The recent declines are consistent with the idea that claims are trending lower as the labor market recovers, aided by progress on virus containment, and we think that this recovery will continue over time,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Unemployment claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March 2020, but are still above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a 200,000 to 250,000 range.
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1 million people filed claims last week. Claims continue to be distorted by backlogs and fraudulent filings.
Ohio, which has been plagued by fraud, accounted for 15.2% of claims last week. Claims shot up in Texas, likely reflecting backlogs following last month's snowstorms.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were higher.

STRONG MANUFACTURING 
The United States had administered 113,037,627 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 147,590,615 doses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The faster pace of inoculations should allow for broader economic re-engagement, even as the rate of decline in new coronavirus infections has leveled off.
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business conditions index surged to a reading of 51.8 this month, the highest since April 1973, from 23.1 in February. Measures of new orders and shipments at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware also soared.
A gauge of factory employment hit its highest level since June 2018 and manufacturers increased hours for workers. But worker shortage is becoming a problem, with nearly two-thirds of manufacturers reporting this was an issue. 
Nearly 45% said they had positions that had remained unfilled for more than three months, while 59% indicated skills mismatches between vacancies and available labor. 
Manufacturers also planned to boost spending on capital projects in the next six months. The survey, however, likely exaggerates the manufacturing sector's health. A global semiconductor shortage is undercutting production of motor vehicles, and bottlenecks in the supply chain remain a constraint for other manufacturing industries.
""The key theme for manufacturing this year is that growth is limited by capacity but not demand,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Still, strong manufacturing aligns with expectations that economic growth this year could be as high as 7%. That would be the strongest since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Graphic: Philly Fed - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/nmoparwkzva/phillyfed.png
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday projected robust growth and higher inflation this year. The U.S. central bank, however, repeated its pledge to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero for years to come.
President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan is sending fresh aid to businesses and households, which will underpin the labor market and overall economy.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of March's employment report. 
The economy added 379,000 jobs in February. Employment remains 9.5 million jobs below its peak before the pandemic barreled through the United States in March 2020.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 18,000 to 4.124 million during the week ended March 6. The drop was mostly because of people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.

About 4.815 million people were on the government-funded extended benefits program during the week ended Feb. 27, down 640,732 from the prior week. The number of people on unemployment benefits under all programs during that period fell 1.9 million to 18.2 million.

Investing.com -- ‘Two steps forward, one step back’ remained the watchword for the U.S. labor market last week, as the number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits rose to 770,000.
That defied expectations of a drop to 700,000. The previous week’s number was also revised higher to 725,000 from an initial estimate of 712,000.
However, the overall number of those claiming under all unemployment-related insurance schemes resumed its downward trend, falling by some 1.9 million to 18.216 million. The broader numbers are reported with a one-week lag to the initial claims numbers.
The numbers, which continue to show layoffs at a rate far in excess of what was usual before the pandemic, give support to the Federal Reserve's assessment of a high level of slack in the labor market, which is the key assumption underlying the central bank's continued belief that it will not have to raise interest rates before 2024.
Diane Swonk, chief economist with Grant Thornton, said via Twitter that the data ""suggests we should see another solid gain in employment in March,"" although she noted that the U.S. economy is ""still 9.5 million jobs in hole, mostly in service sector, including education.""
The figures contrasted sharply with the - less nationally relevant - Philadelphia Federal Reserve monthly business survey, which was published at the same time. The Philly Fed's Business Conditions index rose strongly to 61.6 in March from 39.6 in February, while the manufacturing index soared to its highest level since the mid 1970s. Orders, shipments and backlogs all rose, while the prices paid index hit the highest level since 1980.
The Philly Fed's survey underscored the strain on a manufacturing sector that is struggling to restock after running down inventory levels last year while recurrent outbreaks of Covid-19 repeatedly snarled global supply chains. A global shortage of semiconductors is currently affecting production of products as diverse as mobile phones and cars, while freight costs have soared as shipping companies have struggled to keep pace with the reallocation of consumer spending from services to goods.
 Financial markets were paying more attention to the signs of near-term overheating than the long-term labor market outlook on Thursday. The yield on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.74%, its highest since January 2020, while the 30-Year yield topped 2.50% for the first time since 2019 in the overnight session.

Unemployment dropped to 5.8% from a revised 6.3% in January, data from the statistics bureau showed Thursday in Sydney. Employment jumped by 88,700 in February, compared with an expected 30,000 gain. The participation rate was unchanged at 66.1%, in line with expectations.
“The strong employment growth this month saw employment rise above 13 million people, and was 4,000 people higher than March 2020,” said Bjorn Jarvis, head of labor statistics at the ABS.
The Australian dollar advanced following the data’s release and was trading at 78.23 U.S. cents at 11:44 a.m. in Sydney.
Australia is experiencing a V-shaped recovery as the containment of Covid-19 boosts confidence and encourages cashed-up households to spend. That’s prompted firms to accelerate hiring and people to resume job-hunting.
The Reserve Bank of Australia said last month it was extending its quantitative easing program by a further A$100 billion ($78 billion) and reiterated that it doesn’t expect to increase interest rates until 2024. It’s trying to keep a lid on a currency, which left unchecked could appreciate further and hurt exports and employment.
Among other details in today’s jobs report:
The central bank’s most recent forecasts show the jobless rate falling to around 6% by the end of this year and 5.5% at the end of 2022. Under an optimistic scenario for unemployment, the rate would drop to 4.75% by the end of next year.
The labor market’s strength might cool in the period ahead as the government’s vast wage-subsidy program JobKeeper, designed to keep workers attached to their employers, expires at the end of this month. The government is providing ongoing support to industries like tourism and airlines that are still struggling from closed borders.
The RBA late last year cut interest rates and its three-year yield target to 0.10% and initiated a quantitative easing program to lower borrowing costs across the economy. That came on the heels of the government announcing tax cuts, incentives for firms to invest and hire and infrastructure projects to boost activity.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding dropped to a six-month low in February as severe cold gripped many parts of the country, in a temporary setback for a housing market that remains supported by extremely lean inventories amid strong demand for larger homes.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed a sharp decline in building permits last month. It followed on the heels of data this week showing that the deep freeze, which was most severe in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South region, depressed retail sales and output at factories.
Though the second straight monthly decline in homebuilding could lead economists to trim their lofty gross domestic product estimates for the first quarter, a rebound in starts is expected in the April-June period, keeping intact predictions that economic growth this year will be the strongest since 1984.
Indeed, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday projected robust growth and higher inflation this year. The U.S. central bank, however, repeated its pledge to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero for years to come.
""We can read nothing into the underlying strength of the economy from these weather-distorted reports,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""March data are likely to show strong bounce backs in consumer spending, industrial production and construction activity.""
Housing starts fell 10.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.421 million units last month, the lowest level since last August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would decrease to a rate of 1.560 million units in February.
Starts were down 9.3% on a year-on-year basis in February.
Groundbreaking activity plunged in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but surged in the West. Permits for future home building tumbled 10.8% to a rate of 1.682 million units last month. They, however, jumped 17.0% compared to February 2020, underscoring the housing market's strength.

RISING CHALLENGES 
The year-long COVID-19 pandemic has shifted demand towards bigger and more expensive houses as millions of Americans continue to work from home and remote schooling remains in place. 
But challenges for the housing market, one of the main drivers of the economic recovery, are mounting. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has risen to an eight-month high of 3.05%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Mortgage rates have jumped in tandem with Treasury yields, which have spiked as investors anticipate that stronger growth will generate significant inflation. Growth is being driven by massive fiscal stimulus, including President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package, which was enacted last week.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed a moderate increase in applications for loans to purchase a home last week. Though mortgage rates remain low by historical standards, they are contributing to the rising costs of homeownership, especially for first-time buyers.
Supply disruptions because of coronavirus-related restrictions are driving up commodity prices, including softwood lumber, which surged a record 79.7% in February on a year-on-year basis. According to a survey from the Associated General Contractors of America, manufacturers have hiked drywall prices by 20% effective late March or the beginning of April. 
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders dipped in March, despite strong buyer traffic, amid worries over rising material costs and delivery times, especially for softwood lumber. 
With the supply of previously owned homes at record low levels, builders are likely to continue breaking more ground, though houses could become more expensive.
""Builders face some near-term challenges,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""We don't anticipate that this will weigh too heavily on starts, the forecast is for housing starts to steadily increase throughout the course of this year."" 
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, declined 8.5% to a rate of 1.040 million units in February, also a six-month low. Single-family building permits tumbled 10.0% to a rate of 1.143 million units.
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment plunged 15.0% to a pace of 381,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects declined 12.5% to a pace of 539,000 units.
Housing completions jumped 2.9% to a rate of 1.362 million units last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap. 
The stock of housing under construction rose 0.3% to a rate of 1.283 million units, the highest level since October 2006.

""Builders will continue to have a key role to play in addressing the inventory shortage for a market chock full of eager home shoppers,"" said Matthew Speakman, an economist at Zillow. ""The homebuilding sector has more room to run.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese exports fell in February for the first time in three months as U.S. and China-bound shipments weakened, a source of concern for the world's third-largest economy as it tries to prop up growth.
The trade data comes on the eve of the Bank of Japan's two-day policy review at which it may phase out a numerical target for its risky asset buying, underscoring the rising cost of prolonged easing under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's stimulus.
The prospects for a U.S. recovery may ease concerns about the outlook for Japan's economy, however, which is seen contracting in the current quarter due to new COVID curbs that have hit service-sector activity.
Ministry of Finance data out on Wednesday showed Japanese exports fell 4.5% year-on-year in February, hurt by decline in U.S.-bound shipments of automobiles.
It was the first decline in three months, following a 6.4% gain in January. It was much bigger than a 0.8% drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
By region, exports to China rose 3.4% in the year to February, led by chip-making equipment, nonferrous metals and plastic, slowing sharply from a 37.5% gain in the prior month.
U.S.-bound shipments, another key export market for Japanese goods, declined 14.0% year-on-year in February, dragged down by automobiles, airplane parts and motors, after a 4.8% drop in the prior month and posting a fourth straight month of declines.
Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half Japan's overall shipments, fell 0.8% in the year to February, while those to European Union declined 3.3%, the data showed.
Wednesday's trade data follows the Reuters Tankan poll that found Japanese manufacturers grew more upbeat about a gradual recovery though worries about COVID impact lingered.
Imports rose 11.8% in the year to February, roughly matching the median estimate, following a 9.5% drop in the prior month.
Imports marked the first annual gain in 22 months due to a pick-up in domestic demand, restocking of inventory and rises in crude oil and resources prices.
The trade balance came to a surplus of 217.4 billion yen ($2 billion), versus the median estimate for a 420.0 billion yen surplus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at Japanese manufacturers strengthened in March, the Reuters Tankan poll showed, as firms grew more upbeat about a gradual economic recovery though worries about the immediate impact of the coronavirus remained.
The monthly poll indicated that the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) tankan quarterly survey due April 1 will show an improvement in business sentiment among manufacturers, while that of non-manufacturers remains depressed.
It comes as investors are closely eyeing the outcome of a BOJ policy review on Friday in which it may phase out a numerical target for its asset buying, a move which would mark a turning point for Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's massive stimulus programme.
The Reuters Tankan showed the sentiment index for manufacturers improved to 6 from 3 in the previous month, led by chemicals and oil refinery/ceramics. Some 235 out of 482 large- and mid-sized non-financial firms surveyed between March 3 and March 12 responded, all on condition of anonymity.
Emergency measures rolled out in Japan to halt the country's third, and most lethal, wave of the virus has curbed consumer spending and hit the services sector particularly hard.
""Almost all accommodation and banquet reservations were cancelled due to the impact of the third wave (of the virus), bringing conditions for us back to a critical state,"" a manager at a services sector firm wrote in the survey.
The non-manufacturers' index edged up to minus 5 from minus 7 in the previous month but remained in negative territory. It was seen rising to 5 in June, turning positive, the poll showed.
The world's third-largest economy expanded at a slower-than-initially-reported pace in the fourth quarter of last year, the government said last week, with the virus crisis causing firms to scale down their capital spending.
Respondents said economic conditions were improving, in part due to solid Chinese demand. 
The sentiment index for manufacturers was expected to rise further to 15 in June, according to the poll.
But some noted the rebound was centred on specific areas of the economy, such as semiconductors and electrical device-making.
""The momentum has slowed slightly except in semiconductors even as the recovery trend continues,"" a manager at a rubber producer reported in the survey.
Another manager, at a transport equipment maker, wrote: ""Transportation costs have soared because of a container shortage, and it has become difficult to secure ships, even though customer orders have recovered.""

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.

682,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 01:15PM ET</span>","Cold weather chills U.S. retail sales, manufacturing production","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in February amid bitterly cold weather across the country, but a rebound is likely as the government disburses another round of pandemic relief money to mostly lower- and middle-income households.
The harsh weather also took a bite out of production at factories last month as the deep freeze in Texas and other parts of the South put some petroleum refineries, petrochemical facilities and plastic resin plants out of commission. 
The setback is probably temporary, with the strongest economic growth since 1984 anticipated this year, thanks to massive fiscal stimulus and an acceleration in the pace of vaccines, which should allow for broader economic re-engagement, even as new COVID-19 cases are starting to creep up. 
Federal Reserve officials, who started a two-day meeting on Tuesday, are likely to focus on the underlying economic strength, expectations of higher inflation and a steadily recovering labor market.
""We knew the economy took a major hit in February due to the brutally cold weather and a lot of snow,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""No reason to panic over the February numbers, the economy is moving forward rapidly and it should pick up the pace as the latest stimulus payout hits home.""
Retail sales dropped by 3.0% last month, the Commerce Department said. But data for January was revised sharply up to show sales rebounding 7.6% instead of 5.3% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales falling only 0.5% in February.
Unseasonably cold weather gripped the country in February, with deadly snow storms lashing Texas. The decline in sales last month also reflected the fading boost from one-time $600 checks to households, which were part of nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus approved in late December, as well as delayed tax refunds.
The broad-based decrease was led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships dropping 4.2%. Sales at clothing stores fell 2.8%. Consumers also slashed spending at restaurants and bars, leading to a 2.5% drop in receipts. Sales at restaurants and bars decreased 17% compared to February 2020.
Receipts at electronics and appliance stores dropped 1.9% and sales at furniture stores tumbled 3.8%. There were also big declines in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Receipts at food and beverage stores were unchanged. Sales at building material stores decreased 3.0%. Online retail sales plunged 5.4%.
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. Longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices fell.

TEMPORARY SETBACK
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales decreased 3.5% last month after surging by an upwardly revised 8.7% in January. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have shot up 6.0% in January.
President Joe Biden last week signed his $1.9 trillion rescue package into law, which will send additional $1,400 checks to households as well as extend a government-funded $300 weekly unemployment supplement through Sept. 6. Households have also accumulated $1.8 trillion in excess savings.
""This year, we expect the combination of an improved health situation and generous fiscal stimulus to fuel a consumer boom for the history books,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Saturday raised their first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 6% annualized rate from a 5.5% pace, citing the latest stimulus from the Biden administration. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
Goldman Sachs forecast 7.0% growth this year. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
The rosy economic outlook was not dimmed by a separate report from the Fed on Tuesday showing output at factories tumbled 3.1% in February, also weighed down by a global semiconductor shortage because of the pandemic.
""While we expect these supply disruptions to be temporary, auto production could remain soft in the very near term,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""With substantial new fiscal stimulus to support demand for consumer goods in the coming months, supply disruptions could lead to rising prices.""
Indeed, supply constraints because of coronavirus-related restrictions are driving up commodity prices. A third report from the Labor Department showed import prices rose 1.3% last month after surging 1.4% in January. They jumped 3.0% on a year-on-year basis after rising 1.0% in January.
Graphic: Inflation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvodkyypd/inflation.png
Though inflation is expected to accelerate as early as the first half of this year, many economists do not expect it to spiral out of control with millions of Americans unemployed. Supply chain bottlenecks are also expected to start easing as more people around the globe get vaccinated. 
The dollar has also strengthened so far this year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.

""There is still a great deal of unused industrial capacity in the U.S. economy. This will help keep inflation under control throughout this year,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

683,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories rise moderately in January as sales surge,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories rose moderately in January amid a sharp rebound in consumer spending at the start of the year, and it is now taking businesses the shortest time in nearly nine years to clear shelves.
Business inventories increased 0.3% in January after rising 0.8% in December, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. January's gain was in line with economists' expectations. 
Inventories fell 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in January.
Retail inventories decreased 0.5% in January, instead of 0.6% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.7% increase in December. 
Motor vehicle inventories dropped 1.5%, rather than 1.4% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, dipped 0.1%, instead of slipping 0.2% as estimated last month.
Domestic demand is picking up after slumping late in the fourth quarter, driven by declining COVID-19 infections, an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations and additional pandemic relief money from the government. Households have also accumulated $1.8 trillion in excess savings.
Economists estimate the economy could grow this year by as much as 7%, fueled by the massive fiscal stimulus and rollout of vaccines that are expected to get the pandemic under control. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Wholesale inventories increased 1.3% in January. Stocks at manufacturers gained 0.1%.

Business sales shot up 4.7% in January after rising 1.0% in December. At January's sales pace, it would take 1.26 months for businesses to clear shelves. That was the shortest time since April 2012 and was down from 1.32 months in December.

684,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2021 09:55AM ET</span>",Winter storms hammer U.S. manufacturing production,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Output at U.S. factories plunged in February, depressed by winter storms in Texas, which put some petroleum refineries, petrochemical facilities and plastic resin plants out of commission for the rest of that month.
Manufacturing production dropped 3.1% last month, also weighed down by a global semiconductor shortage, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. That followed a 1.2% jump in January and ended nine straight monthly increases in factory output. Manufacturing production remains below its pre-pandemic level. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would dip 0.1% in February. 
Stormy weather battered the South last month, leaving large parts of Texas without power or water for days. The deep freeze shut oil production and refineries in the state, the biggest producer of natural gas and oil in the United States. 
That likely had a ripple effect on segments of manufacturing tied to the oil industry. Excluding the weather impact, manufacturing output fell 0.5%, the U.S. central bank said.
Production at auto plants continued to be hampered by a shortage of semiconductors, tumbling 8.3% last month. 
But manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, remains underpinned by lean inventories and strong demand for goods, though a shift to services like airline travel and hotel accommodation is likely in the months ahead as more Americans get COVID-19 vaccinations.
A survey this month showed manufacturing sentiment increased to a three-year high in February.
The weakness in manufacturing output combined with a 5.4% dive in mining to push down industrial production by 2.2% in February. That followed a 1.1% jump in January. Bitterly cold temperatures boosted utilities output 7.4%.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, dropped 2.3 percentage points to 72.3% in February. 
Overall capacity use for the industrial sector decreased 1.7 percentage points to 73.8% in February. It is 5.8 percentage points below its 1972-2020 average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

The Labor Department said on Tuesday import prices rose 1.3% last month after surging 1.4% in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, advancing 1.2% in February. 
In the 12 months through February, import prices accelerated 3.0%. That was the largest gain since March 2012 and followed a 1.0% rise in January.
Oil prices have recovered to pre-pandemic levels amid expectations of a pick-up global economic growth, but the COVID-19 pandemic is caused disruptions to the supply chain, boosting prices of commodities. 
Inflation is expected to gain steam this year, driven by massive fiscal stimulus and the reopening of the domestic economy as vaccinations slow the spread of the coronavirus. But excess capacity in the labor market will probably stop price pressures from spiraling out of control. 
Imported fuel prices surged 11.1% last month after advancing 9.0% in January. Imported food prices shot up 1.6%.
Excluding fuel and food, import prices climbed 0.3%. The so-called core import prices rose 0.9% in January.

While the impressive set of numbers released on Monday were heavily skewed by the very low base from last year's massive slump, analysts said they nonetheless showed China's strong rebound remained intact.
Industrial output rose 35.1% in the first two months from a year earlier, up from a 7.3% on-year uptick seen in December, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, stronger than a median forecast for a 30.0% surge in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Retail sales increased 33.8%, also faster than a forecast 32% rise and marking a significant jump from 4.6% growth in December and a 20.5% contraction for January-February of 2020.
""We have a positive outlook for exports and manufacturing investment this year,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics and Oxford Economics. ""And we expect household consumption to become a key driver of growth from Q2 onwards as confidence improves and the government’s call to reduce travel is toned down.""
China's ability to contain the coronavirus pandemic before other major economies were able to do so has allowed it to rebound faster.
In 2020, it was the only major economy to report positive annual growth, with an expansion of 2.3%.
The recovery has been driven by robust trade, pent-up demand and government stimulus.
Export growth hit a record pace in February while factory gate prices posted their biggest expansion since November 2018.
China’s economic activity is normally distorted in the first two months because of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February in 2021.
MODEST EXPECTATIONS
Despite the statistical noise in the latest data, other measures show a broad-based recovery with industrial output up 16.9% and retail sales growing 6.4% compared with the first two months of 2019.
However, Liu Aihua, an NBS spokeswoman, warned that while positive factors for China's economy are increasing, the foundation for the recovery is not yet solid.
""COVID-19 is still spreading around the world and global economic conditions are complex and severe; domestically the imbalances of the recovery are still quite obvious,"" Liu told a briefing in Beijing.
The country saw scattered COVID-19 outbreaks re-emerge earlier this year, but brought them under control by early February. 
Surveyed urban unemployment reversed a steady decline and rose to 5.5% in February from 5.2% in December, indicating increasing pressure on China's job market.
While millions of workers normally travel home over the Lunar New Year holiday, many stayed put this year due to COVID-19 fears. That kept factories humming over the period, but it also had some impact on consumer spending. 
Seasonally adjusted month-on-month data showed retail sales growth actually fell in January-February, likely due to both travel restrictions but also elevated unemployment, analysts at Capital Economics said in a note.
Fixed asset investment increased 35% in the first two months from the same period a year earlier, slower than a forecast 40.0% jump. That compared with 2.9% on-year growth in 2020, and a 24.5% plunge in January-February last year.
Investment grew 3.5% compared with the first two months of 2019.
Private-sector fixed-asset investment, which makes up 60% of total investment, rose 36.4% in January-February, versus a 1.0% increase for the full year of 2020.
Beijing this month set a modest annual economic growth target, at above 6%, well below analysts' consensus forecast of more than 8% this year.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last week the focus for growth this year is on consolidating the economic recovery.
Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management, said the recovery seen in month-on-month indicators may have already peaked, a sign momentum is slowing.

However, he expects infrastructure to receive a boost from still accommodative fiscal policy while exports are likely to maintain growth as the world economy opens.

Investing.com – Economic activity in China soared during the first two months of 2021, but recovery remains uneven a year after the country imposed draconian lockdowns around this time in 2020.
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data released earlier in the day said that industrial production grew 35.1% year-on-year in February, above the 30% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the previously recorded 7.3% growth.
Retail sales also soared 33.8% year-on-year in February, against the predicted 32% growth and the previously recorded 4.6% growth. The unemployment rate was at 5.5%, higher than the previously recorded 5.2%.
The spectacular growth rates of more than 30% for key indicators in the data are largely attributable to distortions when compared to 2020’s lockdowns. It also indicated a rebound happening at uneven rates, with strong industrial output and export demand against lagging consumer recovery.
“We must be aware that the COVID-19 pandemic is still rampaging globally and the world economy is facing severe challenges … domestically, the unbalanced recovery is still notable and the foundation for the economic recovery is not solid yet,” NBS spokeswoman Liu Aihua said in a statement.
China is the only major economy to have returned to economic growth after imposing 2020’s lockdowns as COVID-19 spread. Soaring global demand for medical goods and work-from-home devices has also given the recovery a boost.
The economy grew 2.3% in 2020 and is forecast to expand 8.4% in 2021, although the recently-ended National People’s Congress set a more modest growth goal of “above 6%.” There are also signals that the government will gradually scale back COVID-19 stimulus measures.
However, investment figures released Monday showed manufacturers are still cautious and that businesses, “especially private-owned enterprises, will begin to have a stronger willingness to invest only after the recovery of their profit growth is confirmed,” China Renaissance Securities economist Bruce Pang told Bloomberg.
“Consumer demand also remains weak, with retail sales in February rising only 0.56% from the previous month, “indicating that the Lunar New Year may have had a weaker boost to national consumption than expected,” he added.
The government issued advisories not to travel during February’s Lunar New Year holidays to curb an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country earlier in the year. The additional manpower in what is usually the biggest travel season of the year in the country likely boosted industrial output as factories either remained open or resumed production earlier than usual. Inversely, spending on travel, restaurants, and leisure activities dropped during the holidays."

LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses are more likely to expect a rebound in activity this year than their counterparts abroad, and expectations of a pick-up in growth are stronger than at any point since 2015, a survey showed on Monday.
The global poll of 12,000 manufacturers and services providers, conducted three times a year for consultants Accenture (NYSE:ACN) by data company IHS Markit, showed 68% of British firms expected activity to rise, while 11% saw a fall.
The net balance of +57% is the highest since June 2015 and up from +34% in October, and also tops readings for businesses in the United States, Japan and continental Europe.
""After a tough year it is encouraging to see business confidence bouncing back,"" Accenture consultant Rachel Barton said.
Britain's economy shrank by 10% last year - its biggest fall in over 300 years as many areas of business activity ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic. Government budget forecasters this month said it would take until mid-2022 for the economy to recover its pre-COVID size.
Britain suffered Europe's highest death toll from COVID, but is now rolling out vaccines faster than other European countries and the government hopes to fully lift social-distancing restrictions by late June.
The strongest improvement in optimism in the survey - conducted from Feb. 11 to Feb. 25 - was in the hotels and restaurant sector which has been hardest hit by the crisis.
Separately, manufacturing trade body Make UK said on Monday that it was revising up its 2021 growth forecast to 3.9% from 2.7%. Industrial output in Britain slumped by 8.6% last year - the biggest drop since records began in 1949.
""After the seismic shock to the sector last year, manufacturers are now beginning to move through the gears and accelerate into recovery as demand at home increases and major markets also begin to pick up,"" Make UK's chief executive, Stephen Phipson said.
However, it warned that January data which showed a 40% slump in exports to the EU added to evidence that post-Brexit trade restrictions were causing more severe damage than the 'teething problems' admitted by the government so far.

Make UK said that in its latest survey, members reported a further fall in export demand that contrasted with a rebound domestically and for exporters based in other countries.

Underneath those eye-popping numbers though will be the first look at whether the economy’s two-speed recovery from the pandemic persisted in the first two months of the year. Growth has so far been fueled by an export and industrial-led boom, with consumer spending slow to pick up.
China posted record contractions in the data a year ago when the economy was mostly shut down, first because of the usual Lunar New Year holiday break, and then a lockdown to contain the world’s first Covid-19 outbreak.
With the pandemic now under control domestically and the economy mostly reopened, comparisons with a year ago make it difficult to assess the true momentum of the recovery, especially for consumers.
Read More: China Heads for Record GDP Growth in Months of Wild Data Swings
Comparing the actual value of retail sales should provide some guide as to whether private consumption continued its pick up from late 2020, or is still struggling.​​
“As the recovery has been largely driven by the industrial recovery, I would focus on retail sales,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Hong Kong. “Headline growth below 32% would be considered weak.”
Economists like Bruce Pang of China Renaissance Securities Ltd. are looking at comparisons with 2019 data instead to get a better sense of the recovery. He said any year-on-year growth rate below 15% would be considered weak.
Whatever the actual numbers, the data will still show China as the only major economy that’s powering out of the pandemic, propelled by rising debt and an export boom. The government is now looking to gradually pull back on its fiscal stimulus and rebalance growth so that it’s driven more by consumption.
That was a key theme outlined by the government during the National People’s Congress, China’s biggest political meeting of the year, which concluded last week. The government set a modest growth target of “above 6%” for 2021 in comparison with the 8.4% expansion economists predict, allowing officials to focus on curbing risks, such as easing debt and asset bubbles.
Read More: What We Learned From China’s Biggest Political Meeting
Another factor complicating the data in the first two months of the year was the imposition of travel restrictions before the Lunar New Year break, which fell in February. To curb sporadic virus cases in some parts of the country, the government discouraged people from making their annual trips home for the holidays.
That likely helped to boost industrial output, with factories able to remain open or resume production earlier than usual to meet soaring export demand. But it also suppressed spending on tourism and travel, restaurants and leisure activities as millions of people refrained from booking train and air tickets and cut back on hosting banquets and buying presents.
Through March 8, people took almost 41% fewer trips this year than in 2020, according to data from the Ministry of Transport, and travel was down almost 71% compared to the same period in 2019. Consumption in lower-tier cities and the countryside likely took a hit, while higher-tier cities probably benefited as people stayed near their workplace during the holidays.
Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Hong Kong, said growth rates below 20% for any of the data released Monday should be considered weak given last year’s very low base.
“On retail sales, I would look at catering, which has been heavily affected by social distance measures,” she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased strongly in February, leading to the largest annual gain in nearly 2-1/2 years, but considerable slack in the labor market could make it harder for businesses to pass on the higher costs to consumers.
That was supported by a survey on Friday showing an easing in consumers' near-term inflation expectations early this month, even as their confidence in the economy rose to a one-year high.
Receding new COVID-19 cases, an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government are seen allowing wider economic re-engagement in the spring. 
Inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months and exceed the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average, by April. Part of the anticipated spike would be the result of price declines early in the pandemic washing out of the calculations. Many economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, do not expect the strength in inflation will persist beyond the so-called base effects.
""Beyond a rise in the metrics this year on base effects and a fuller reopening of the economy that will revive demand, price pressures are unlikely to keep accelerating, given an incomplete recovery in the labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.5% last month, with the costs of energy products and food surging, the Labor Department said. That followed a 1.3% jump in January, which was the biggest advance since December 2009.
In the 12 months through February, the PPI accelerated 2.8%, the most since October 2018. The PPI increased 1.7% year-on-year in January. Last month's rise in the PPI was in line with economists' expectations. (Graphic: Inflation, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznvngzdrpl/inflation.png) 
Manufacturing and services industries have been flagging higher production costs as the year-long pandemic gums up the supply chain. Surveys this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries in February racing to levels last seen in 2008. 
These inflation jitters have boosted U.S. Treasury yields.
The government has provided nearly $6 trillion in relief since the pandemic started in the United States in March 2020, with President Joe Biden on Thursday signing legislation for his $1.9 trillion package. At the same time, Fed is pumping in money through monthly bond purchases, raising fears in some quarters of the economy overheating. 
But the worst recession since the Great Depression, which started in February 2020, has left at least 20.1 million Americans on unemployment benefits.
""Supply-chain issues are temporarily putting upward pressure on producer prices along with higher energy prices,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""These pressures should begin to moderate. We expect growth in consumer prices to accelerate through the first half of this year, but this will be transitory.""
Consumers' one-year inflation expectations moderated to 3.1% in mid-March from 3.3% in February, the University of Michigan said in a separate report on Friday. Its preliminary consumer sentiment index rose to 83.0, the highest since last March, from a final reading of 76.8 in February.

FOOD PRICES SOAR
A 6.0% jump in the cost of energy goods accounted for more than two-thirds of the broad-based rise in the PPI last month. Energy prices rose 5.1% in January. Wholesale food prices jumped 1.3%. Goods prices rose 1.4%. 
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices climbed 0.2%. The so-called core PPI accelerated 1.2% in January. In the 12 months through February, the core PPI increased 2.2% after gaining 2.0% in January.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its inflation target. The U.S. central bank has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot its target. 
The core PCE price index is at 1.5%. The government reported this week that the core CPI barely rose in February after being unchanged for two straight months.
In February, wholesale core goods prices gained 0.3% after rising 0.8% in January, driven by the dollar's weakness against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.
The cost of services edged up 0.1% last month after accelerating 1.3% in January, which was the biggest increase since December 2009. Healthcare costs dipped 0.1% after surging 1.2% in January. Portfolio fees dropped 1.1% after soaring 9.4% January. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index.
With the PPI and CPI data in hand, economists are estimating that the core PCE price index rose by as much as 0.18% in February. That would lift the annual increase in the core PCE price index to as high as 1.6%. The data is due to be released on March 26. 
Healthcare and rents will determine the inflation path.

""If medical services strength combines with stronger rents later this year, as we expect, the two large components of services inflation would be supportive of the view that core PCE inflation is running more stably at or above 2%,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation accelerated to a three-month high in February on higher fuel prices, which could challenge the central bank's accommodative stance and record-low key policy rates adopted to boost the pandemic-hit economy. 
Annual retail inflation rose 5.03% in February, up from 4.06% in January, and below the 4.83% forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, data released by the Ministry of Statistics showed on Friday.
Retail petrol prices in the national capital New Delhi have gone up by nearly 9% so far this year, while diesel prices are up over 10%, pushed up by higher federal and state taxes, putting pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cut taxes. 
The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which kept the benchmark repo rate unchanged at 4% last month, is expected to keep rates unchanged at its next meeting from April 5-7. 
After cutting the repo rate by 115 basis points to sustain the economy during the coronavirus crisis, the central bank has kept the policy rate unchanged since May, 2020.
Analysts said high commodity prices will continue to fan inflation in the coming months. 
""The rising global crude prices will continue to add inflationary risks going ahead and CPI (retail inflation) will remain elevated,"" said Rahul Gupta of Emkay Global Financial Services.
""Currently CPI is within RBI's target range but at the April meeting, the central bank will have to tackle increasing inflation and rising bond yields,"" Gupta said. 
India's economy is projected to contract 8% in the current financial year ending in March before growing at around 11% next financial year.
Retail food prices, which comprise nearly half of India's inflation basket, increased 3.87% in February on year compared to 1.96% in January.
Core inflation, excluding food and fuel costs, was estimated in the range of 5.61%-5.9% for the month by four economists, compared to 5.5%-5.7% in January.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian retail sales fell in January for a third consecutive month, official figures showed on Friday, largely in line with expectations and led by declining supermarket, food and drink sales, as well as weakness in the clothing and footwear sector.
Researchers at government statistics agency IBGE said the fall was in large part due to the expiration on Dec. 31 of emergency government cash transfers to millions of poor families to help them through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The 0.2% monthly fall was slightly less than the 0.3% decline forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and the 0.3% fall compared with the same month a year earlier was slightly more than the 0.25% fall forecast in the poll.
January's figures followed a 6.2% slump in retail sales in December, the second biggest fall on record. 
Four of the eight segments covered by IBGE showed falling sales in January. Supermarket, food and drink sales fell 1.6% on the month, while clothing and footwear sales were down 8.2%.
On a wider basis, including cars and building materials, retail sales in January fell 2.1% on the month, and were down 2.9% from January 2020, IBGE said. 

Since rebounding to record levels in October last year, the volume of retail sales in Latin America's largest economy has fallen 6.5%, IBGE said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank by less than feared in January when the country went back into a coronavirus lockdown, but trade with the European Union was hammered as new post-Brexit rules kicked in.
Gross domestic product was 2.9% lower than in December, the Office for National Statistics said. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a contraction of 4.9% and government bond prices fell as investors took the data as a sign that the Bank of England was less likely to pump more stimulus into the economy.
Britain suffered its worst economic slump in three centuries last year when it shrank by 10%. It has also been hit with Europe's biggest COVID-19 death toll of over 125,000 people.
But the country is racing ahead with vaccinations and, after Friday's figures, economists said they expected the economy would shrink by 2% in the first quarter of 2021, half the hit forecast by the BoE only last month.
Many businesses are learning to cope with lockdowns, including retailers who have ramped up their online shopping operations and services firms that have tried to help workers to do their jobs from home.
Samuel Tombs, with Pantheon Macroeconomics, predicted a 5% second-quarter growth rebound ""which would kibosh the chances of the Monetary Policy Committee reducing Bank Rate this year.""
The BoE looks set to keep its stimulus programmes on hold next Thursday. 
The ONS figures also showed exports and imports from Britain to the EU plunged by the most on record, although there was a delay in gathering some of the data and there were signs of a pick-up towards the end of January.
Exports of goods to the EU, excluding non-monetary gold and other precious metals, slumped by 40.7%. Imports fell by 28.8%. 
Many companies brought forward imports to avoid border disruption from Jan. 1 onwards, and global trade flows have been hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
SERVICES HIT
The overall GDP figures were hit hard by the impact of social distancing rules on Britain's huge services sector.
""The economy took a notable hit in January, albeit smaller than some expected, with retail, restaurants, schools and hairdressers all affected by the latest lockdown,"" Jonathan Athow, an ONS statistician, said.
Manufacturing fell for the first time since April with car production down sharply. 
But ING economist James Smith pointed to the boost to GDP from Britain's COVID-19 health policy response: ""What really stands out is health expenditure, where the ramping up of the government's test and trace scheme and vaccine programmes added 0.9% to the GDP figures alone."" 
The economy remained 9% smaller than in February last year, before the pandemic hit.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to ease England's coronavirus restrictions gradually before lifting most of them by late June.
Growth in the next few months is also likely to get a boost from finance minister Rishi Sunak's announcement last week that he will pump a further 65 billion pounds ($90.6 billion) into the economy, including an extension of his jobs-protecting furlough scheme.

The ONS said services output shrank by 3.5% in January from December. The Reuters poll had pointed to a 5.4% contraction.

Exports of goods to the EU, excluding non-monetary gold and other precious metals, slumped by 40.7% in January, the Office for National Statistics said. Imports fell by 28.8%
The ONS had previously warned that the hit to trade from the COVID-19 pandemic would make it difficult to identify a Brexit impact from new customs arrangements in January's data.
But it said there were signs that this hurt trade at the start of the year.
""External evidence suggests some of the slower trade for goods in early January 2021 could be attributable to disruption caused by the end of the transition period,"" the ONS said.
It said the weak figures likely reflected a lull after stockpiling in November and December ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period and it also pointed to a new national coronavirus lockdown in Britain that started in January.
""All of these are potential contributing factors to the fall in January trade in goods,"" the ONS said.

Britain's overall goods trade deficit, including non-EU countries, narrowed to 9.826 billion pounds ($13.70 billion) in January from 14.315 billion pounds in December.

698,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims at four-month low; labor market regaining footing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits dropped to a four-month low last week as an improving public health environment allows more segments of the economy to reopen, putting the labor market recovery back on track.
Still, a full recovery from the deep scars inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic will probably take years, with the weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday also showing a whopping 20.1 million Americans collecting unemployment checks in late February.
""We're likely on the verge of much lower unemployment claims, but we're not there yet,"" said Robert Frick, economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia. ""Assuming COVID-19 infections and deaths continue to decline, we expect lower, and perhaps dramatically lower, claims this spring.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 42,000 to a seasonally adjusted 712,000 for the week ended March 6, the lowest level since early November. Data for the prior week was revised to show 9,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 725,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims dropped 47,170 to 709,458 last week, amid declines in Texas, New York and Mississippi, where claims had been boosted in the prior period by harsh weather. But there was a big jump in claims in California. 
Filings also rose in Ohio, which has been plagued by fraudulent applications. The state accounted for 18% of the claims filed last week, though it makes up only 3.7% of total employment.
""If these claims were genuine, more than 20% of Ohio workers lost their job in February,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""Removing this distortion alone would lower the total number of claims in recent weeks for the U.S. by about 100,000.""
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.2 million people filed claims last week.
New coronavirus infections have dropped for eight straight weeks, declining 12% last week, according to a Reuters analysis of state, county and CDC data. Vaccinations jumped to a record 2.2 million shots per day and virus-related deaths fell 18%.
That, together with nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief money advanced by the government in late December, fired up consumer spending and hiring in February after declining in December.
President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion stimulus bill into law on Thursday, which he hailed as ""rebuilding the backbone of this country.""
The package will send fresh aid to small businesses as well as one-time $1,400 checks to mostly lower- and middle-income households. A government-funded $300 weekly unemployment supplement will be extended through Sept. 6.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Dow (DJI) indexes hitting all-time highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

VACANCIES RISE 
Steady labor market recovery was underscored by other data from the Labor Department on Thursday showing job openings increased 165,000 to 6.9 million in January. Layoffs declined 136,000 to 1.7 million. 
Still, there was only 0.68 job per unemployed person in January versus 1.23 jobs in February 2020. 
""The labor market remains far from a healthy place, but there are glimmers of hope in these numbers and others,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""If coronavirus cases continue to fall and the pandemic gets under control, the labor market can start to sustainably heal.""
(Graphic: JOLTS, https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qzjpqljkbvx/JOLTS1.png) 
Employment is 9.5 million jobs below its peak before the pandemic barreled through the United States in March 2020.
Jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March 2020, but are still above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession and could remain elevated because of the expanded unemployment benefits. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a 200,000 to 250,000 range.
""There is some risk in our view though that expanded unemployment, with benefits of an additional $300 per week, could keep the level of claims for unemployment benefits more elevated this year, as some workers could earn more on unemployment than in their previous jobs,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
Regular state unemployment benefits averaged about $346 per week in January. Together with the weekly $300 subsidy, they add up to $646 per week or over $15 per hour for a 40-hour week.
The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, though some states have higher rates.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 193,000 to 4.144 million during the week ended Feb 27. The decrease largely reflected people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.

About 5.455 million people were on the government-funded extended benefits program during the week ended Feb. 20, up 986,351 from the prior week. There number of people on unemployment benefits under all programs during that period increased by 2.087 million.

The WTO's services trade barometer rose to a record high of 104.7 in March after 95.6 in September and a low of 91.2 in March 2020, the Geneva-based trade body said.
""World services trade appears to be in a recovery phase... However, continued weakness in some sectors and an uneven distribution of COVID-19 vaccines cast some doubt on the durability of the recovery,"" the WTO said.
The WTO said that components of its ""barometer"" related to purchasing managers' indexes, container shipping, construction and financial services all rose above their medium-term trends. 
By contrast, IT services were weak, driven down by stricter U.S. lockdowns weighing on computer services, and air transport was very weak.
The WTO services trade barometer is a composite of published data and is designed to gauge momentum in global trade growth rather than to provide a specific short-term forecast. 

It dates back to 2000, with a reading of 100 marking the boundary between above and below trend growth.

Investing.com -- The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits fell last week to its lowest level since the pandemic erupted a year ago, signaling that the reopening of the U.S. economy is damping the pace of layoffs around the country.
The Labor Department said that 712,000 initial jobless claims were filed last week, down from 754,000 the week before and a bigger drop than expected. The consensus forecast ahead of time had been 725,000. 
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, also fell by more than expected to 4.144 million, a drop of almost 200,000 from the previous week.
The Labor Department's figures weren't all rosy, however. The broadest measure of people claiming unemployment-related benefits rose by nearly 2 million to top 20 million again, thanks to rises of 1 million each in claimants under two pandemic-related schemes, known as Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation. Those programs cater to the self-employed (notably to gig workers) and the long-term unemployed.
Almost all of that increase was accounted for by the state of California, suggesting that the state may have undercounted its claimants in past weeks.
The data come against the backdrop of a U.S. economy that is slowly starting to eat away at the vast amount of slack in the labor market. The economy added nearly 400,000 jobs last month, with more than that number created in the services sector, where restaurants and non-essential stores were among the biggest hirers.  "

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Annual inflation in Brazil rose above 5% in February for the first time in more than four years, official figures showed on Thursday, above analysts' expectations and driven largely by as a strong rise in transport costs.
Coming less than a week before the central bank's next policy decision, the figures are likely to cement the consensus view that the first increase in Brazilian interest rates since 2015 is imminent.
The annual rate of consumer inflation in February was 5.20%, statistics agency IBGE said, above the 5.06% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the highest since January 2017, according to Refinitiv data.
The central bank's year-end target is 3.75%, with a 1.5 percentage point margin of error on either side.
The monthly rate of inflation rose to 0.86%, IBGE said, the highest for any February since 2016 and higher than economists' forecast for a 0.72% increase. 
Eight of the nine categories surveyed by IBGE showed rising prices in February, with a 2.28% rise in transport costs accounting for almost half of the overall rise.

Within the transport segment, fuel prices rose more than 7% on the month, IBGE said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a budget deficit of $311 billion in February, a record high for the month and up $76 billion from the same month last year, as outlays to fight the coronavirus pandemic remained high, the Treasury said on Wednesday.
Receipts for February rose 32% from the year-earlier period to $248 billion, a phenomenon due largely to a $45 billion reduction in tax refunds issued during the month because the 2021 tax filing season started about two weeks later than in 2020.
Individual and withheld income tax receipts also rose by $9 billion, which a Treasury official said was due to tax withholding on increased unemployment benefits, along with increased hours worked at higher wage rates as lower-wage earnings languished. 
February outlays also grew 32% to $559 billion, with the biggest increases for unemployment benefit-related costs and health expenditures. Both receipts and outlays were record highs for February.

For the first five months of the 2021 fiscal year, the deficit rose 68% to a record $1.047 trillion for the period, beating the previous record deficit of $652 billion in October-February of fiscal 2010.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2021 12:20PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer prices rise; underlying inflation muted for now,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in February, with households paying more for gasoline, but underlying inflation remained tepid amid weak demand for services like airline travel and hotel accommodation.
The mixed report from the Labor Department on Wednesday did not change expectations that inflation will push higher and exceed the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average, by April as declining COVID-19 infections and a faster pace of vaccinations allows the economy to reopen. 
Inflation is also seen accelerating as price decreases early in the coronavirus pandemic wash out of the calculations. Many economists, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell expect the strength in inflation will not stick beyond the so-called base effects and the reopening of services businesses.
""Base effects and one-time price increases stemming from the reopening of the economy and some pass-through of higher prices from supply chain bottlenecks should lift core inflation to 2.5% in the spring,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
""However, the acceleration in inflation will be transitory and will not represent the start of an upward spiral."" 
The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month after rising 0.3% in January. A 6.4% advance in gasoline prices accounted for more than half of the gain in the CPI. 
In the 12 months through February, the CPI shot up 1.7%, the largest rise since February 2020, after climbing 1.4% in the 12 months through January. Last month's CPI readings were in line with economists' expectations.
Gasoline prices surged 7.4% gain in January. Food prices climbed 0.2% last month, with the cost of food consumed at home gaining 0.3%. The cost of food consumed away from home rose 0.1%.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI nudged up 0.1% after being unchanged for two straight months. The so-called core CPI was lifted by a surprise pick-up in rents as well as rising costs for recreation, medical care and motor vehicle insurance, which offset declines in prices for airline fares, hotel and motel rooms, used cars and trucks and apparel. 
The core CPI rose 1.3% on a year-on-year basis, retreating from January's 1.4% gain. The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its inflation target. The U.S. central bank has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot its target. The core PCE price index is at 1.5%.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
LABOR MARKET SLACK 
There are fears from some quarters that a very expansionary fiscal policy, marked by nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief money in late December and President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue package, expected to be approved by Congress this week, could stoke inflation. 
That, together with the Fed's monthly bond purchases could cause the economy, which plunged into recession in February 2020, to overheat. U.S. Treasury yields have spiked in anticipation of stronger economic growth this year and higher inflation. But there is plenty of slack in the labor market, with at least 18 million Americans on unemployment benefits.
Still, the stronger inflation prophecies could become self-fulfilling. Consumers are already anticipating to pay more in the near-term and many small business are planning price increases. Surveys this month showed measures of prices paid by manufacturers and services industries racing to levels last seen in 2008 in February.
Reports from the Atlanta Fed on Wednesday showed businesses' one-year inflation expectations jumped to 2.4% in March from 2.2% in February. Its sticky-price CPI, a weighted basket of items that change price relatively slowly, jumped 2.3% in February after rising 1.1% in January.
""Data suggests that we're not only witnessing the end of disinflation for some time, but rapid growth and firmer prices will punctuate the bounce-back from Covid lows,"" said Rick Rieder, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s chief investment officer of global fixed income. 
""However, while we think growth will be surprisingly strong, we also think that over the intermediate-term the Fed is correct in thinking inflation will remain muted by the same factors that have held sway over the past two decades, the demographic trend of population aging and technological disinflation.""
In February, apparel prices fell 0.7% after three straight monthly increases. The cost of healthcare rose 0.3%, driven by increases in the costs of doctor visits, though consumers paid less for prescription medication and hospital visits.
The cost of airline fares tumbled 5.1% after decreasing 3.2% in January. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.3% after nudging 0.1% in January. 
The increase occurred despite the rental housing market being hurt by a flight from city centers to suburbs and other lower density areas. Many landlords have entered into forbearance agreements with tenants.
""The stabilization in our shelter tracker and a waning drag from rent forgiveness suggest scope for some of the rental acceleration to be sustained in the spring months,"" economists at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note. 

Services excluding energy rose 0.2% in February after being unchanged for two consecutive months. Consumer spending on services is about 3.3% below its pre-pandemic level.

There were a seasonally adjusted 48,749 applications from corporations, down 10.4% from January. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 51,071, a decrease of 12.9% from the prior month. Overall, business applications fell in all four regions last month and were across all industries.
The COVID-19 pandemic has decimated businesses in the services sector, especially restaurants and bars, leaving millions unemployed. Additional fiscal stimulus, declining new cases and a faster pace of vaccinations have allowed many businesses to reopen, boosting consumer spending and hiring.

Based on the February data, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which compiles the data, projected about 31,153 new business startups with payroll tax liabilities would form within four quarters of application, down 13.2% compared to the estimates for January.

The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.1% from a month earlier and 1.3% from the prior year. The overall CPI rose 0.4% from the prior month and 1.7% from a year earlier, a Labor Department report showed Wednesday.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists for the month-on-month change in the CPI was for a 0.4% gain. The core measure was projected to rise 0.2%.
Treasuries pared earlier losses, while inflation expectations remained higher and the yield curve added slightly to its steepening on the day. The dollar edged lower from earlier highs and U.S. stock futures rose, reversing earlier losses.
Yields on U.S. Treasuries have surged recently on inflation bets, but Federal Reserve officials have brushed off the concerns and expect any pickup to be transitory.
Investors and economists are split on the inflation outlook, with some predicting a wave of rising prices driven by stronger demand and pandemic stimulus, while others say the forces that have contained price pressures for years -- from technology to demographics -- are still in place.
Despite the softer-than-expected figures, inflation is poised to accelerate in the months ahead -- driven by pandemic stimulus, income growth and a vaccination campaign that’s helping businesses to reopen.
Starting with the March data, the so-called “base effect” will push up the headline rate, because sharp declines in prices at the start of the pandemic will influence the year-on-year calculations. That means even fairly small price increases during the month will likely cause the annual measure to jump above 2%.
Some pockets of the economy are already showing signs of bubbling inflationary pressures. In January, a measure of producer prices surged by the most in records dating back to 2009. The Institute for Supply Management’s factory measure of prices paid for materials rose to the highest since 2008 last month.
The Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus bill will add to the more than $1 trillion in excess savings that American households racked up during the pandemic. It’s unclear how much of that money they’ll spend in the coming months on things they couldn’t do during the health crisis, like restaurant dining or travel.
The CPI report showed prices of goods, excluding food and energy, declined 0.2% in February from a month earlier, the first decrease since May. Apparel and medical care commodities costs both dropped 0.7%, while prices of used vehicles fell 0.9% for a third month.
Services prices minus energy rose 0.2%, the first increase in three months, reflecting higher shelter costs and medical care services.

707,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 10:51PM ET</span>","Chinese Factory Prices Soar in February, but Challenges Remain on Road to Recovery","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s factory gate prices climbed at their fastest pace since November 2018 in February, with the scramble to fill export orders raising expectations for strong Chinese growth in 2021.
National Bureau of Statistics data released earlier in the day showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month, against the 0.4% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and January's 1% growth.
The CPI contracted 0.2% year-on-year, against the forecast 0.4% contraction and January's 0.3% contraction. The Producer Price Index grew 1.7% year-on-year in February, against the forecast 1.5% growth and January’s 0.3% growth.
The low base in 2020 was one factor in the better-than-expected data but comes as investor worries about surging inflation globally continue to mount.
Trade data released during the previous week said that exports climbed 60.6% year-on-year in February. Also, during the previous week, the National People’s Congress set a modest economic growth target of above 6% for 2021, against investor expectation for an expansion of more than 8%.
The second-largest economy globally continues to face challenges on the road to recovery, as the COVID-19 situation remains severe globally and continues to erode demand.
“We do not think the recent period of consumer price deflation is likely to persist. Shifting pork price base effects will nudge up food inflation, a tightening labor market will push up core inflation and energy inflation will rebound thanks to rising oil prices,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
“Given that officials have signaled a hawkish tilt in recent weeks, we think the People’s Bank of China will tighten policy this year,” the note added."
708,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 10:15PM ET</span>","China February factory prices roar back, consumer deflation ebbs","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate prices rose at the fastest pace since November 2018 in February as manufacturers raced to fill export orders, raising expectations for robust growth in the world's second-largest economy in 2021.
The producer price index (PPI) rose 1.7% from a year earlier, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Wednesday, compared with the median forecast for a 1.5% rise from a Reuters poll of analysts and speeding up from a 0.3% pickup in January.
The firmer-than-expected price data is in part driven by a very low base a year earlier but also comes as the spectre of surging inflation globally rattles financial markets amid concerns the world economic recovery may overheat.
China's exports in February grew at a record 154.9% in dollar terms from a year earlier, when the country was in virtual shutdown during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Beijing last week set an economic growth target of above 6% for 2021, which is modest when compared with analyst expectation for an expansion of more than 8%. China's gross domestic product rose 2.3% in 2020, its weakest growth in 44 years but stronger than its global peers.
Chinese officials continue to warn of difficult external conditions, however, as the pandemic remains severe in other parts of the world and saps demand. 
The consumer price index fell 0.2% from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in a separate statement, compared with a 0.4% fall tipped by a Reuters poll and a 0.3% decline in January.
""We do not think the recent period of consumer price deflation is likely to persist. Shifting pork price base effects will nudge up food inflation, a tightening labour market will push up core inflation and energy inflation will rebound thanks to rising oil prices,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note.

709,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 09:45PM ET</span>","China Producer Prices Jump, Adding to Global Inflation Risks","(Bloomberg) -- China’s producer prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in February, fueled by surging commodity costs, while consumer deflation eased.
Resurgent producer prices raises the prospect of China exporting inflation to the rest of the world as factories start hiking prices for goods sold abroad. Bond markets have already been roiled by expectations that faster global growth and massive fiscal stimulus will push up inflation.
The biggest PPI gains were in mining, which climbed 6.8% in February from a year ago. Raw material prices rose 2.9% after several months of declines.
“Metal prices were on the rise due to global fiscal stimulus money to be spent on infrastructure projects,” said Iris Pang, chief economist for greater China at ING Wholesale Banking. “If crude oil price keeps increasing it would push up other prices, like transportation, and therefore production cost, then it could generate inflation.”
Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile energy and food costs, were unchanged from a year earlier. Falling pork prices, a key element in the country’s CPI basket, have been the main driver of weaker consumer inflation in recent months, with prices falling 14.9% in February from a year ago after declining 3.9% in January.
That trend could reverse with the re-emergence of African swine fever in Asia, which could threaten hog supplies once again. However, Lu Ting, chief China economist at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc., points out that the statistics bureau made a downward revision to pork’s weighting in the CPI basket last month, a change that could keep prices elevated.
China’s government outlined new economic targets last week, setting a goal of about 3% for consumer inflation for this year, down from 3.5% in 2020. It’s aiming for economic growth of more than 6% as the recovery from the pandemic continues to strengthen.

710,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 07:55AM ET</span>",Mexico inflation quickens in February to highest since October,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican annual inflation accelerated to its highest rate in four months in February due to a rise in energy costs, but stayed within the central bank's target range, data from the national statistics agency (INEGI) showed on Tuesday.
Consumer prices rose by 3.76% in the year through February, beating the consensus forecast of a Reuters poll for a reading of 3.72%. Inflation, which stood at 3.54% a month earlier, quickened to its highest level since reaching 4.09% in October.
The Bank of Mexico targets a rate of 3% with a one percentage point tolerance threshold above and below that figure.
The uptick in inflation may add weight to the view among some analysts who believe the Mexican central bank should pause its rate-cutting cycle when it meets for its next monetary policy decision.
Compared with the previous month, consumer prices rose 0.63 percent in February. A rise of 0.59% had been forecast in the poll.

The core index, which strips out some volatile items, rose 0.39% from January. The annual core inflation rate ticked up to 3.87%, slightly above the forecast figure.

711,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",Coronavirus curbs hit euro zone fourth-quarter GDP more than estimated quarter-on-quarter,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy contracted more than previously estimated in the last three months of 2020 against the previous quarter, revised data showed on Tuesday, as household consumption plunged because of COVID-19 lockdowns.
The European Union's statistics office said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, more than the initial 0.6% estimate, for a 4.9% year-on-year drop, less the previous estimate of 5.0%.
The main downward pull came from household consumption which subtracted 1.6 percentage points quarter-on-quarter from the final quarterly result and 4.1 points from the annual number.
Growing inventories added 0.6 points to the final quarterly figure, government spending another 0.1 points and investment 0.3 points, but trade gave a negative contribution of 0.1 points.
Pandemic lockdowns, which have closed economies to various degrees across the single currency bloc since October, also hit jobs, with employment growth slowing to 0.3% quarter-on-quarter from a 1.0% growth in the previous three months.
In the last three moths of 2020, 157.9 million people were employed in the euro zone, Eurostat estimated, 3.1 million fewer than in the same period of 2019.

Counted in terms of hours worked, employment contracted 1.6% in the fourth quarter against the previous three months after a 14.4% jump in July-September when European economies briefly re-opened after the first wave of the pandemic.

712,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 10:35PM ET</span>",Japan downgrades fourth-quarter GDP as companies scale back spending,"By Daniel Leussink and Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded at a slower-than-initially-reported pace in October-December, with firms tightening spending on plant and equipment as the coronavirus pandemic clouded their business plans.
The slower growth was mainly due to a sharper contraction in private inventories and capital expenditure expanding less than previously thought in the fourth quarter, even as exports remained solid.
Separate data showed household spending was hit by a much bigger annual drop in January than in the prior month, a sign the COVID-19 pandemic was keeping consumers cautious about shopping.
The economy grew an annualised 11.7% in October-December, weaker than the preliminary reading of 12.7% annualised growth to mark the second straight quarter of growth, Cabinet Office data showed Tuesday.
The reading, which was weaker than economists' median forecast for a 12.8% gain, translates into a real quarter-on-quarter expansion of 2.8% from October-December, versus a preliminary 3.0% gain.
Capital spending grew 4.3% from the previous quarter, lower than a preliminary 4.5% rise, but outpacing the median forecast for a 4.1% increase.
Private inventories, including raw materials and manufactured products, subtracted 0.6 percentage point from revised gross domestic product growth (GDP), which was more than a negative preliminary contribution of 0.4 percentage point.
""Although vaccination started in Japan, it will take time to yield its impact, so the economy is forecast to go though some ups and downs,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""We expect the economy will pick up from the second quarter but it will be difficult to regain soon what it will lose in the first quarter.""
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of GDP, rose 2.2% from the previous three months, matching the preliminary reading.
Net exports - or exports minus imports - added 1.1 percentage point to revised GDP growth, while domestic demand lifted it by 1.8 percentage point, weaker than a preliminary contribution of 2.0 percentage point.
HOUSEHOLD SPENDING DROPS
The worse-than-expected GDP revision comes after exports and factory output picked up in January, signalling a stronger recovery in global demand following last year's deep coronavirus slump.
Household spending, however, fell 6.1% in January compared with the same month a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, worse than the 2.1% drop expected by economists in a Reuters poll.
Separate data showed real wages dropped for the 11th straight month in January, although at a slower pace than in the prior month, as the pandemic continued to pressure corporate profits.
Some analysts are worried that a cold spell in corporate investment and household spending could last longer than expected, boding ill for demand and threatening to leave the world's third-largest economy without a domestic growth driver.

The Bank of Japan will conduct a review of its policy tools next week to make them more ""effective and sustainable"" as the pandemic forces it to keep its radical stimulus programme in place longer than originally expected.

Consumer spending was 13.8% lower than a year before, similar to January's plunge of around 16%, Barclaycard said.
Spending on essential items grew 5.3% and online grocery shopping surged. But spending on non-essentials plummeted 22.1% with many businesses still closed.
After suffering its biggest slump in three centuries last year, Britain's economy is expected to grow strongly once the COVID restrictions are lifted between now and late June.
Barclaycard said a survey which it had commissioned showed consumers' confidence in the wider economy rose by 4 percentage points to 28%, its highest point since the pandemic hit last year. 
Many people were thinking about where to spend the savings they had racked up while stuck at home. A fifth of those who had saved more than normal said they would take a big holiday and 13% planned treats for themselves.
The survey of 2,003 people was conducted between Feb. 19 and Feb. 22, before finance minister Rishi Sunak announced an extension of support for households and businesses in a new budget plan last week.
The Bank of England is watching to see how much of the big increase in household savings is spent as it tries to gauge the likely strength of the economy's bounce-back.
A separate survey published on Tuesday by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body also showed how households, for now at least, were focusing their spending on essential items.
Its measure of overall retail spending at major retail chains rose by 1.0% in February compared with the same month last year, faster than the average growth rate of 0.6% in the past three months.
Over the three months to February, total food sales increased 7.9% but sales of non-food items fell by 5.5%.
Paul Martin, UK head of retail at accountants KPMG which produces the survey with the BRC, said Sunak's budget last week offered only short-term help for retailers.

""Conditions will continue to be incredibly challenging as they face subdued demand, thinner margins and rising logistics costs, alongside the accelerated structural changes to the sector,"" Martin said.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>",U.S. wholesale stocks rise; inventories-to-sales ratio lowest in six years,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. wholesale inventories increased solidly in January even as sales surged and it is taking wholesalers the shortest time in six years to clear shelves, a sign of strengthening demand that aligns with expectations for faster economic growth this year. 
The Commerce Department said on Monday that wholesale inventories rose 1.3% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers gained 0.6% in December. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product also increased 1.3% in January.
Inventories rose 0.6% in January from a year earlier. Sales at wholesalers jumped 4.9% after advancing 1.9% in December. At January's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.24 months to clear shelves. That was the shortest since November 2014 and was down from 1.29 months in December.
Domestic demand is picking up after hitting a pothole late in the fourth quarter, driven by declining COVID-19 infections and nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief from the government. Consumer spending rebounded sharply in January after slumping in November and December.
""Pent-up demand, particularly coming from middle- and high-income households who have been aggressively saving throughout the crisis, is set to drive consumption spending throughout the year as the health crisis begins to abate,"" said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
Spending is likely to accelerate further if Congress, as expected, approves President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan. The bill, which was passed by the Senate on Saturday, will send onetime $1,400 checks to many low- and middle-income Americans as well as extend government-funded unemployment benefits for millions of people.
Households have accumulated $1.8 trillion in excess savings.
Economists estimate the economy could grow this year by as much as 7%, fueled by the massive fiscal stimulus and rollout of vaccines that are expected to get the pandemic under control. That would be the fastest growth since 1984 and would follow a 3.5% contraction last year, the worst performance in 74 years.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic, helping to underpin manufacturing. But a big chunk of the inventory build is coming from imports, which could keep the trade deficit elevated. 
The government reported last week that imports of goods raced to a record high in January. Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts rebounded 1.2% in January. There were also increases in stocks of professional and computer equipment, as well as petroleum. Machinery inventory, however, fell. 

Wholesale goods sales were boosted by the automotive, professional equipment, computer equipment, machinery and petroleum categories.

Consumers said they expect gas prices to rise by a median 9.6% over the next year, up from 6.2% in January. It was the fifth straight month of increase and a new high for the survey, which launched in 2013. Similarly, rent is expected to increase by a median of 9.0% over the next year, up from 6.4% in January.
Respondents also raised their expectations for how much food, medical care and college will cost over the next year.
A drop in coronavirus infections, the distribution of vaccines and expectations for additional fiscal support is raising hopes that the U.S. economy could be poised for a robust recovery this year. Investors expecting stronger inflation are moving into riskier assets, leading to a rise in long-term Treasury yields. 
Some investors worried about inflation have speculated the Fed would move to lower long-term borrowing costs by adjusting its bond-buying program. But Fed officials signaled last week that they view the rise in long-term yields as a sign of growing optimism about the economy and do not expect to adjust monetary support in the near future. Fed officials will meet again for a policy-setting meeting on March 16 and 17. 
The New York Fed's survey is based on a rotating panel of about 1,300 households. 

Median inflation expectations over the next year rose slightly to 3.1% in February, reaching the highest level since July 2014. Projections for inflation at the three-year horizon stayed flat at 3.0%, according to the monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations.

718,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 11:15PM ET</span>",Chinese Exports Continue to Surge on Back of Strong Demand,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Chinese exports rose in February, continuing a surge recorded in the first two months of 2021. The upward trend reflects strong global demand for manufactured goods, but the figures are partly skewed by the low base in 2020 when the economy shut down due to COVID-19.
General Administration of Customs data released on Sunday said that exports climbed 60.6% year-on-year in February, above the 38.9% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and the 18.1% growth recorded in January.
Exports more than doubled from 2020 in February alone, despite the volatility usually seen in Chinese economic activity for the first two months of the year thanks to the Lunar New Year holiday. The comparison with 2020, when factories and businesses shut down to contain COVID-19, distorted the figures even further in 2021.
Strong demand for medical equipment and work-from-home devices, which has helped to underpin China’s V-shaped recovery from the pandemic since the second half of 2020, also continued to boost exports. Demand has also been helped by improving COVID-19 situations in major trading partners like the U.S. and Europe.
A shorter-than-usual break for migrant workers during the Lunar New Year holiday, and the subsequent early resumption of factory production, also boosted exports. An outbreak of COVID-19 earlier in the year discouraged many workers from the traditional journey back to their hometowns during the holiday.
“Excluding distortions from base effects, trade growth was still quite solid,”  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. analysts said in a note.
While export growth will likely slow after March as base effects ease, fresh stimulus measures in developed nations, especially in the U.S., “may bolster external demand for Chinese products and partly offset the downward pressure,” the note added.
Imports grew 22.2% year-on-year, against the forecast 15% growth and January's 6.5% growth. The data did suggest a divergence between heavy industries and hi-tech sectors, with the latter outperforming, according to Bloomberg.

719,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 10:27PM ET</span>",China’s Soaring Exports Show Strong Demand a Year After Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s exports surged in the first two months of the year, reflecting strong global demand for manufactured goods and with figures partly skewed by the low base in 2020 when the economy was in lockdown.
Exports jumped 60.6% in dollar terms in the January-February period from a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed Sunday, well above the 40% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In February alone, exports more than doubled from last year.
The first two months are normally volatile for China’s economic activity because of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February this year. The figures are even more distorted this time around because of the comparison with 2020, when factories and businesses were shut to contain the coronavirus outbreak in the early part of the year. Exports plunged 17.4% in the first two months of last year.
Even with the favorable base effects, the data shows exports continued to benefit from soaring global demand for medical equipment and work-from-home devices, which has helped to underpin China’s V-shaped recovery from the pandemic since the second half of the year.
The customs agency said the strong trade data reflects improving demand in major trading partners like the U.S. and Europe, a domestic recovery that’s fueling import growth, and base effects from last year’s slump.
Travel Restrictions
Exports also benefited from a shorter-than-usual vacation for migrant workers during this year’s Lunar New Year break and the early resumption of factory production. Travel restrictions imposed early in the year prevented many workers from making their annual trip home during the holiday.
“Excluding distortions from base effects, trade growth was still quite solid,”  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. economists led by Ting Lu wrote in a note. While export growth will likely slow after March as base effects ease, fresh stimulus measures in developed nations, especially in the U.S., “may bolster external demand for Chinese products and partly offset the downward pressure,” they said.
Imports also grew strongly, climbing 22.2% in the first two months of the year from a year earlier, exceeding the 16% gain predicted by economists. A breakdown of the data suggests a divergence between heavy industries and hi-tech sectors, with the latter outperforming, according to Bloomberg Economics.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
In the longer term though, we see uncertainty for exports in the second half of the year as external demand for working-from-home and anti-epidemic goods may start to slow, alongside the pandemic staying in check. In addition, more export economies would return to the market, potentially leading to more intensive competition in global markets.
-- David Qu, China economist

The value of exports declined to almost $205 billion in February, likely due to the Lunar New Year holiday. However, that was still 155% higher than shipments in the same month in 2020, when China was in lockdown to contain the first outbreak of Covid-19.
The data comes two days after the National People’s Congress, the biggest political meeting of the year, kicked off in Beijing, with the government setting out its economic agenda for coming years. Authorities are targeting growth of more than 6% this year, a relatively conservative goal compared with the 8.4% expansion that economists predict. The government also signaled more restrained monetary and fiscal policy after last year’s pandemic stimulus.
“We expect Beijing to carry out its policy normalization in coming months, although a sharp shift in policies appears unlikely,” Nomura’s economists said.

720,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2021 06:20AM ET</span>",China February exports post record surge from COVID-19-depressed 2020 levels,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's February exports grew at a record pace from a year earlier when COVID-19 battered the world's second-biggest economy, customs data showed on Sunday, while imports rose less sharply.
Exports in dollar terms skyrocketed 154.9% in February compared with a year earlier, while imports gained 17.3%, the most since October 2018. The data did not include figures for January alone. 
In the January-February period, exports jumped 60.6% from a year earlier, when lockdowns to contain the pandemic paralysed the country's economic activity. That exceeded the forecast of analysts in a Reuters poll for a 38.9% surge. 
Strong exports, which benefited from China's success in largely containing the public health crisis, have helped fuel the country's recovery from a pandemic-induced paralysis. 
The surge was driven by a rebound in foreign demand, customs said in a statement on its website, citing improvements in manufacturing industries in the European Union and the United States, and their increased imports of Chinese products thanks to fiscal stimulus measures.
""In addition, a majority of manufacturing employees (in China) chose to stay put over the Lunar New Year holidays,"" the statement said. ""Our survey showed a lot of firms in export-oriented provinces stayed open, and orders that usually only get delivered after the new year had been delivered normally.""
Chinese factory activity usually goes dormant during the Lunar New Year break, which fell in the middle of February this year, as workers return to their hometowns. This year, the government appealed to workers to avoid travelling to curb the risk of a spread of the coronavirus. 
In January-February, imports increased 22.2% from a year earlier, above the 15% forecast, partly due to stockpiling of semiconductors and energy products, according to customs. 
China posted a trade surplus of $103.25 billion for the first two months. Analysts had expected the trade surplus to narrow to $60.15 billion from $78.17 billion in December.
'NORMAL YEARS'
In yuan terms, exports rose 50.1% in the two months from a year earlier, while imports gained 14.5%.
""Due to the impact of the new coronavirus, overall trade (in yuan terms) in January-February last year fell 9.7%, and the low base was one of the reasons for the larger increase this year,"" customs said. ""But even when compared with normal years, such as the comparable periods in 2018 and 2019, growth in China's overall trade was around 20%.""
China's economy expanded 2.3% last year, helped by solid demand for Chinese-made goods such as medical and work-from-home equipment, although the growth was its weakest in 44 years.
This year, China has set a modest growth target of at least 6%, planning a careful course out of a year disrupted by COVID-19 and amid heightened tensions with the United States.
China's trade surplus with the United States stood at $51.26 billion in January-February. Chinese customs did not give a monthly breakdown. The surplus was $29.92 billion in December.

Katherine Tai, President Joe Biden's nominee to be U.S. trade representative, said last week she would work to fight a range of ""unfair"" Chinese trade and economic practices.

Canada's trade surplus with the rest of the world was C$1.41 billion ($1.11 billion) in January, the largest since July 2014. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a deficit of C$1.40 billion.
""In a sea of really bad news this is an island paradise. Everything is up,"" said Peter Hall, chief economist at Export Development Canada. 
""This is very strongly driven by our top trading partner,"" Hall said, noting that demand from the United States will continue to be strong as its economy strengthens with increased vaccinations spurring a broader recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Canadian dollar clawed back some of its earlier decline after the data, trading 0.1% lower at 1.2678 to the greenback, or 78.88 U.S. cents.
Canada's exports jumped 8.1% in January, led by a large sale of used aircraft to the United States. Even without the atypical aircraft sale, aggregate exports would have been up, with strong exports of gold bars, crude oil and lumber. 
Excluding the swings of 2020, exports posted their largest increase since August 1995.
""The return to surplus in January ... is consistent with expectations that Canada's trade position will improve through 2021 amid returning global demand and firmer energy prices,"" said Ryan Brecht, a senior economist at Action Economics.
Canada's export of services rose slightly on an increase in transportation services, but they still remain 16.3% below the February 2020 level.

Imports edged up 0.9% in January, mostly on higher imports of energy products. Canada's December trade deficit was revised to C$1.98 billion.

722,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2021 02:21PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market roars back; road to full recovery remains very long,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created more jobs than expected in February as falling new COVID-19 infections and additional pandemic relief money from the government boosted hiring at restaurants and other services businesses, firmly putting the labor market recovery back on track. 
Though job growth momentum is expected to build in the months ahead amid an acceleration in the pace of vaccinations and more fiscal stimulus, it will probably take several years for the labor market to heal from the deep scars inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, which is now in its second year.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday showed at least 4.1 million Americans have been out of work for more than six months, accounting for 41.5% of the unemployed population in February. Another 3.5 million have permanently lost their jobs. 
Graphic: Unemployment duration - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xegpbwrqdvq/ueduration.png
""There remains easy fuel for strong payroll gains in coming months as the reopening gains momentum,"" said Robert Rosener, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York. ""But there is much further to go before conditions are consistent with maximum employment.""
Nonfarm payrolls surged by 379,000 jobs last month after rising 166,000 in January. Payrolls fell in December for the first time in eight months. The economy has recouped 12.7 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in the pandemic recession. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast February payrolls increasing by 182,000 jobs. Restaurants and bars hired 286,000 workers last month, accounting for 75% of the payrolls gain. There were also increases in employment at hotels and motels and at amusements, gambling and recreation establishments. Altogether, leisure and hospitality employment jumped by 355,000 jobs.
Temporary help, a harbinger for future hiring, increased further. Healthcare and social assistance also added jobs, and retailers hired 41,000 workers. Manufacturing payrolls increased by 21,000 jobs. About half of the factory job gains were in transportation equipment, despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has forced some automakers to cut production.
But construction employment decreased by 61,000 jobs because of bitter cold across the country. Government payrolls dropped by 86,000 jobs, with losses concentrated at state and local governments. The diffusion index, or measure of private industries expanding, jumped to 57.0 from 48.4 in January.
The surge in hiring follows on the heels of a strong rebound in consumer spending in January, which prompted economists to sharply upgrade their growth estimates for the first quarter. 
A decrease in daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations and nearly $900 billion in stimulus provided by the government at the end of December are driving the revival in economic activity and hiring. That has stoked inflation fears. 
The White House is not backing down on President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan. Economists have warned the massive package, combined with the Federal Reserve's near zero interest rates and bond purchases, could cause the economy to overheat.
U.S. Treasury yields have jumped as investors see higher inflation.
""We will always be rooting for more job growth for more Americans across the board,"" National Economic Council Director Brian Deese told CNBC. ""We think that if we pass this rescue plan right now we could be poised for really strengthening the economy and getting to full employment significantly faster than most forecasters estimate without this plan.""
Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday again brushed aside the inflation concerns, saying he expected the U.S. central bank ""will be patient"" until the economy is ""very far along the road to recovery."" 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed.

PLENTY OF SLACK
Even as the labor market recovery is regaining steam, ample slack remains. Though the unemployment rate fell to 6.2% last month from 6.3% in January, it continued to be understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this problem, the unemployment rate would have been 6.7%. It is about 9.5%, including people who have given up the search for work.
A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, was unchanged at 11.1%. Unemployment remains high among Blacks and Hispanics, as well as Americans without a high school diploma and college degrees. 
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was steady at 61.4% in February. The participation rate has tumbled from 63.3% in February 2020, with women accounting for the biggest share of dropouts.
According to Census Bureau data, around 10 million mothers living with their own school-age children were not actively working in January, 1.4 million more than during the same month in 2020.
""The Fed wants a 'broad' recovery in the labor market across income and racial groups,"" said Joseph Song, a U.S. economist at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities in New York. ""So while there is meaningful improvement, the labor market is far from returning to normal.""

With the lower-wage leisure and hospitality industry accounting for 94% of payrolls growth last month, average hourly earnings gained 0.2%. Unseasonably cold weather shortened the average workweek to 34.6 hours from 34.9 hours.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that the trade gap rose 1.9% to $68.2 billion in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a $67.5 billion deficit in January.
Goods imports advanced 1.6% to $221.1 billion, the highest on record. Consumer spending increased by the most in seven months in January, boosted by government checks to low-income households as part of nearly $900 billion in additional COVID-19 pandemic relief.
The surge in demand also reduced inventories at retailers in January, according to an advance estimate published by the government last week. Lean inventories and anticipated strong domestic demand as new coronavirus cases decline and the pace of vaccinations accelerates, suggest imports will continue to rise.

Exports of goods gained 1.6% to $135.7 billion. Trade has subtracted from gross domestic product growth for two straight quarters.

Investing.com -- Hiring in the U.S. economy accelerated sharply in February, reviving hopes of a rapid recovery from the winter wave of layoffs due to Covid-19 restrictions.
Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 379,000 through the middle of the month, almost double the 182,000 consensus forecast. The number for January was also revised sharply by higher by over 100,000 to 166,000.
The data reflected the gradual reopening of parts of the U.S. economy as the pressure on the country's hospitals eased off during the month. Gross gains in services employment totaled 513,000, with the leisure and hospitality sector alone adding 355,000 jobs as bars and restaurants resumed business, albeit often still under capacity constraints.
The figures are likely to reinforce concerns that the Federal Reserve will start to withdraw monetary stimulus from the economy sooner than originally planned. In a speech on Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had again said that he wanted to see substantial progress in bringing down unemployment before thinking about tightening monetary policy.  Powell has repeatedly stressed that the U.S. is still operating with around 10 million fewer jobs, relative to its pre-pandemic state.
The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3% in January, while the broader U6 measure of joblessness, which captures a broader sample of underemployment, remained steady at 11.1%. The labor force participation rate stayed at 61.4%. 
The numbers emboldened those willing to be on higher interest rates: 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to 1.58% from 1.56% immediately before the release, while five-year yields, which are more sensitive to expectations of changes in Fed policy, rose 4 basis points to 0.84%. They've now risen some 15 basis points this week.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Industrial production in Brazil rose in January for a ninth straight month, figures showed on Friday, but it was the slowest rate in that period, offering another indication that the wider economic recovery is losing steam.
January's 0.4% increase in industrial output was exactly in line with the median estimate in a Reuters poll of economists, while the year-on-year rise of 2.0% was slightly below the poll forecast of 2.2% growth. 
Graphic: Brazil industrial production - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdedjdpo/IPMONTH.png
Statistics agency IBGE said the main drivers were a 3.1% increase in food production, and a 1.5% rise in mining output.
Not only was the overall increase the slowest in the past nine months, IBGE also said it was spread across a far narrower range of categories and segments.
""Industry kept up its positive performance, but decelerated in January,"" said IBGE survey manager Andre Macedo.
""It is also worth noting that the number of segments with a negative performance was a majority (14 of 26), something that has not been seen before in this sequence of nine months of growth,"" he said.
Capital goods and consumer goods production were the only two of four major categories to record an increase in output in January, while only 11 of the 26 industry segments surveyed showed growth, IBGE said.
Purchasing managers index data show that the pace of expansion in Brazil's manufacturing sector picked up again in February after three months of deceleration, driven by strong increases in new orders and production.
But confidence in the sector fell in February for a second consecutive month, a sign that the deadly second wave of the COVID-19 virus is taking its toll.
In the nine consecutive months of rising output, the sector grew by more than 42%, IBGE said, more than making up for the 27% contraction in March and April at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns.
However, Brazilian industry is still 12.9% smaller than its peak in May, 2011, IBGE said.

The central bank forecasts a 5.1% rise in industrial output this year, following last year's 4.5% slump.

DIHK's survey of 2,400 internationally active companies found that only 17% expected better business conditions over the next twelve months than in 2020, while 27% expected business conditions to deteriorate.
Expectations vary by region, DIHK said, adding that more business expect conditions to improve iin China and the euro zone positive than expect it to deteriorate.
Expectations of markets in south and central America, Africa and the Middle East were worse, the survey found.
In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic crisis and growing trade barriers in many regions of the world are also weighing on companies' foreign business this year, the DIHK said. 

Around 47% of companies are reporting increasing trade barriers such as higher tariffs, sanctions and increased safety requirements.

The data published by the Federal Statistics Offices showed orders for industrial goods rose on the month by 1.4% in seasonally adjusted terms, compared with a Reuters forecast for a rise of 0.7%.
The increase came after a downwardly revised decrease of 2.2% in December.
Domestic orders fell by 2.6% on the month while orders from abroad rose by 4.2%. Contracts from the euro zone increased by 3.9%. Orders from the rest of the world rose by 4.4 %.
German factories have been humming along during the pandemic on higher foreign demand, helping the economy avoid a contraction in the last quarter of 2020 and offsetting a drop in consumer spending amid a partial lockdown to contain COVID-19.
Higher demand from China, the United States and Europe drove growth in German factory activity to its highest level in more than three years in February, brightening the outlook for the economy, a survey showed on Monday.
However, lockdown measures introduced in November, and then tightened in mid-December, have held back private consumption.
Strong exports and solid construction activity helped the economy to grow by 0.3% in the final quarter of last year, but the stricter lockdown measures at home and abroad are clouding the economic outlook.
German business groups expressed dismay on Thursday after Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed a gradual easing of coronavirus curbs but added an ""emergency brake"" to reimpose restrictions if case numbers get out of control.

The tentative reopening plan dashed any hopes of a swift rebound in consumer spending this month to end a weak first quarter on a stronger note.

Household spending likely shed 2.1% in January from a year earlier, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll of 15 economists, after a 0.6% decline in December. On a monthly basis, spending likely fell 3.1% in January after a 0.9% gain in December, according to the poll.
""Stay-at-home demand such as for electric appliances and food and beverages remained firm but service spending such as travel and eating out appeared to have weakened,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Japan's export-reliant economy, the world's third largest, has bounced back from its worst postwar recession last year thanks to a rebound in overseas demand. 
But ongoing coronavirus curbs are hitting Japan's services sector as the country grapples with its third wave of infections. Japan's government plans to extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Friday.
Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) likely expanded an annualised 12.8% in October-December, according to analysts in the poll, slightly higher than a preliminary reading of 12.7%. 
The government is due to release revised GDP data and household spending data on March 9.
GDP was seen rising 3.0% in the October-December period from the previous quarter, unchanged from an initial estimate, the poll showed.
Capital spending likely grew 4.1% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the poll showed, compared with an initial reading of 4.5% growth.

Analysts said better-than-expected public spending likely supported overall GDP in the fourth quarter of 2020.

 Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC), the U.S. government-owned mortgage holder, reported on Thursday that the 30-year fixed rate mortgage has edged up 0.6 percentage points to 3.02%, its highest level since July.
""Since reaching a low point in January, mortgage rates have risen by more than 30 basis points, and the impact on purchase demand has been noticeable,"" said Sam Khater, chief economist with the government-owned mortgage holder. ""While purchase activity remains high, it has cooled off over the last few weeks and is currently on par with early March, prior to the pandemic.""
This aligns with data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, which reported on Wednesday that the average 30-year fixed contract rate increased to 3.23%, marking the second straight week above the 3% level which it sank below in mid-November.
Mortgage rates tend to shadow moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which has climbed in recent weeks on expectations that government stimulus and a countrywide vaccination program are fueling an economic rebound in the U.S.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, likely boosted by brutal winter storms in the densely populated South in mid-February, though the labor market outlook is improving amid declining new COVID-19 cases.
That was confirmed by other data on Thursday showing job cuts announced by U.S.-based companies plummeted 57% in February. The labor market has lagged an acceleration in overall economic activity, driven by nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic aid provided by the U.S. government in late December.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also struck an optimistic note on the labor market on Thursday, telling a Wall Street Journal forum that there is ""good reason to expect job creation to pick up in the coming months."" Powell, however, said there is still a lot of ground to cover for the labor market to get back to a state of full employment. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 745,000 for the week ended Feb. 27, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 750,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims rose 31,519 to 748,078 last week, boosted by filings in Texas and New York, as well as in Ohio, which has been plagued by fraudulent applications.
Stormy weather in the South left large parts of Texas without power or water for days. The deep freeze shut oil production and refineries in Texas, the biggest producer of natural gas and oil in the United States. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.2 million people filed claims last week.
But the sun is slowly starting to peek through the clouds shrouding the labor market. In a separate report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S. companies announced 34,531 job cuts in February. That was the smallest number since December 2019 and was down from 79,552 January.
""The jobs picture is beginning to firm up again after a rough winter,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY
A drop in daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations helped to lift consumer spending in January. Though the pace of decline in infections has stalled, economists believe the labor market will accelerate in the spring and through summer, noting that vaccinations were increasing daily.
A boost to hiring is also expected from President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan, which is under consideration by Congress. 
Still, the road to recovery remains long and difficult.
Though weekly jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March 2020 when the pandemic hit the United States a little more than a year ago, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. 
In a well-functioning labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 124,000 to 4.295 million during the week ended Feb 20. But that was mainly due to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.
About 4.465 million people were on the government-funded extended benefits program during the week ended Feb. 13. At least 18 million people were on unemployment benefits under all programs in mid-February. 
""This underscores just how far the nation is from a genuine labor market recovery,"" said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. 
Government-funded unemployment benefits will expire in mid-March if Congress does not pass the Biden administration's relief package, affecting nearly 12 million people.
Last week's claims data has no bearing on February's employment report as it falls outside the period during which the government surveyed establishments and households. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the government will likely report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 182,000 jobs in February after rising by only 49,000 in January.
Hopes for a pick-up in hiring last month were supported by a survey last week showing consumers' perceptions of the labor market improved in February after deteriorating in January and December. In addition, a measure of manufacturing employment increased to a two-year high in February.
But those expectations were tempered by reports on Wednesday showing private employers hired fewer-than-expected workers in February. Employment growth in the services industry retreated last month, with businesses reporting they were ""unable to fill vacant positions with qualified applicants.""
The year-long COVID-19 pandemic is keeping some workers at home, fearful of accepting or returning to jobs that could expose them to the virus. Millions of women have left the labor force to look after children as many schools remain closed.

The Fed's ""Beige Book"" report on Wednesday noted ""continued difficulties attracting and retaining qualified workers"" reported by many of the U.S. central bank's contacts last month, with labor shortages ""most acute among low-skill occupations and skilled trade positions."" The Fed's contacts cited the coronavirus, childcare, and unemployment benefits as factors behind the labor supply problem.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders shot up 2.6% after rising 1.6% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders advancing 2.1% in January. Orders increased 1.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, has been driven by strong demand for goods, like electronics and furniture as 23.2% of the labor force works from home because of the virus. Demand could, however, shift back to services in the summer as more Americans get vaccinated, and slow manufacturing activity from current levels.
A global semiconductor chip shortage, which on Wednesday forced General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to extend production cuts at its plant in Fairfax, Kansas, could slow momentum. But the outlook for manufacturing remains solid, with the Institute for Supply Management's index of national factory activity rising to a three-year high in February.
Factory goods orders in January were boosted by strong demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as primary metals and fabricated metal products. But orders for machinery fell. 
Unfilled orders at factories edged up 0.1% in January after decreasing 0.2% in December. 
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.4% in January instead of 0.5% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 1.8%. They were previously reported to have surged 2.1% in January.

Business spending on equipment increased robustly for a second straight quarter in the fourth quarter, contributing to the economy's 4.1% annualized growth rate during that period.

Investing.com -- The number of people applying for jobless benefits stayed at an elevated level for another week, despite the first relaxations of measures designed to stop the winter surge in Covid-19 cases.
The Labor Department said that 745,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, fractionally below expectations for 750,000 but up slightly from a revised total of 736,000 last week. The biggest increase in initial claims was in Texas, with just under 18,000. The state had suffered disproportionately from the collapse of its energy system due to an extreme cold snap late last month.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, fell by 124,000 to 4.295 million. However, that number doesn't capture the full extent of underemployment caused by the pandemic and the lockdown measures taken to contain it. 
The broadest measure of those claiming under federal and state programs, which include those set up specifically since the pandemic struck, showed a big improvement in the week through February 13, falling by over 1 million to 18.026 million. 
""Two good weeks in this volatile series don’t prove anything,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in emailed comments, ""but whatever happens next week, we expect the trend to fall sharply over the next few months, provided the new Covid variants don’t trigger a spring wave in cases and, more importantly, hospitalizations.""
""The jury is still out,"" he added.
There were clearer signs of progress with the monthly Challenger Job Cuts survey, which fell by more than half from January's level to 34,531. That's the lowest level since before the pandemic erupted a year ago.
Hopes for a relatively swift decline in unemployment have risen in recent weeks as a series of states, most notably Texas this week, have lifted public health measures restricting businesses, which have hit the labor-intensive service sector particularly hard. However, a suite of Federal Reserve officials have pointed to a still-vast reservoir of unemployed and discouraged workers, noting that the prospect of full employment is still way off. 
Employment in the U.S. is currently running some 10 million below where it was a year ago."

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 53.3 from 49.2, moving above the 50 threshold for growth. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 51.0.
""The rebound was supported by the largest rise in commercial development activity since last September as the successful vaccine roll-out spurred contract awards on projects that had been delayed,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at financial data company IHS Markit.
""House-building is still the engine of recovery for the construction sector, although there was a loss of momentum since January as adverse weather and longer wait times for materials contributed to some temporary delays on site,"" he added.
Britain's housing market has boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, spurred by demand for more spacious properties and a tax break which finance minister Rishi Sunak extended for up to six months for some home-buyers in Wednesday's budget statement.
The survey showed purchasing costs for construction companies rose at the fastest pace since August 2008, reflecting global shipping shortages and demand for raw materials.
Timber was in particularly short supply, IHS Markit said.

The all-sector PMI, which combines the construction survey with readings for the much larger services and manufacturing sectors published earlier in the week, rose to a two-month high of 50.0 in February from 42.0 in January.

That was also corroborated by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report, which noted ""continued difficulties attracting and retaining qualified workers"" by many of the U.S. central bank's contacts last month, with labor shortages ""most acute among low-skill occupations and skilled trade positions.""
The year-long COVID-19 pandemic is keeping some workers at home, fearful of accepting or returning to jobs that could expose them to the coronavirus. The data was published ahead of the government's closely watched employment report on Friday, and could temper expectations for an acceleration in job growth in February. The ADP's private payrolls report, however, has a poor track record predicting the private payrolls count in the government's more comprehensive employment report.
""This is a disappointment given that the drop-off in coronavirus case numbers and the resulting lifting of containment measures should be giving the economy a bigger shot in the arm,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
Private payrolls rose by 117,000 jobs last month after increasing 195,000 in January, the ADP National Employment Report showed. The report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls increasing by 177,000 jobs in February. 
Construction employment fell by 3,000 jobs and manufacturing payrolls decreased 14,000. Hiring in the services sector increased by 131,000 jobs, with the leisure and hospitality industry adding 26,000 positions. Harsh weather in some parts of the country was also likely a factor holding back gains.

Still, the labor market has been slow to regain traction even as some restrictions on services businesses have been rolled back amid a drop in new COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. Though the rate of decline in coronavirus cases has stalled, economists still believe the labor market will accelerate in the spring and through summer.
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its measure of services sector employment fell to a reading of 52.7 in February from 55.2 in January. 
The lack of significant improvement in the labor market is also despite nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government in late December, which boosted consumer spending and positioned the economy for faster growth in the first quarter. 
Gross domestic product growth estimates for the first quarter have been raised to as high as a 10% annualized rate from as low as a 2.3% pace. The upgrades also reflect President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan, under consideration by Congress. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
""Historically, employment lags GDP by a quarter or so,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Everything from that (GDP) front looks good, we are expecting substantial job growth in the not-too-distant future.""
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
RISING COSTS
According to a Reuters poll of economists, the government will likely report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 180,000 jobs in February after rising only 49,000 in January.
Hopes for a pick-up in hiring last month were supported by a survey last week showing consumers' perceptions of the labor market improved in February after deteriorating in January and December. In addition, a measure of manufacturing employment hit a two-year high in February.
The retrenchment in services employment last month contributed to the ISM's broader non-manufacturing activity index declining to a nine-month low of 55.3 in February from 58.7 in January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
Brutal winter storms lashed Texas and parts of the populous South region in mid-February. 
The lack of qualified workers at suppliers and manufacturers is creating bottlenecks in the supply chain, sticking businesses with higher production costs. The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries jumped to 71.8, the highest since September 2008, from 64.2 in January. 
It mirrored findings of the ISM's manufacturing survey this week and a surge in consumers' near-term inflation expectations.

Inflation is expected to accelerate in part as last year's pandemic-driven weak readings drop out of the calculation. Economists are divided on whether the jump in price pressures will stick beyond the so-called base effects. 
U.S. Treasury yields have risen, with investors betting that the Fed's ultra-easy monetary policy stance and White House's proposed massive stimulus will ignite inflation.

Many services businesses complained about supply delays and raw material shortages caused by the dearth of workers. Wholesalers reported an ""ongoing influx of price increases due to raw-material shortages."" Retailers said ""price increases are occurring with more frequency,"" while accommodation and food services noted suppliers were proposing ""price increases that are above and beyond normal expectations.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity unexpectedly slowed in February amid winter storms, while a measure of prices paid by companies for inputs surged to the highest level in nearly 12-1/2 years, bolstering expectations for faster inflation in the near term.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 55.3 last month from 58.7 in January, which was the highest since February 2019. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index unchanged at 58.7. Brutal winter storms lashed Texas and parts of the populous South region in mid-February, leaving millions of people without water and power. 
But a drop in new COVID-19 cases and an increase in vaccinations has allowed authorities to roll back some restrictions on restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses. Though the rate of decline in coronavirus infections has stalled, economists still believe the services industry will regain speed in the spring and through summer. 
The pandemic, which has disproportionately affected the services industry by shifting demand to goods, has also created bottlenecks in the supply chain through labor shortages at suppliers and manufacturers. That has left businesses with high production costs.
The survey's measure of prices paid by services industries jumped to 71.8 last month, the highest reading since September 2008, from 64.2 in January. It mirrored findings of the ISM's manufacturing survey published on Monday and a surge in consumers' near-term inflation expectations.
Inflation is expected to accelerate in the coming months in part as last year's pandemic-driven weak readings drop out of the calculation. Economists are divided on whether the jump in price pressures will stick beyond the so-called base effects. 
U.S. Treasury yields have risen, with investors betting that the Federal Reserve's ultra-easy monetary policy stance and President Joe Biden's push for $1.9 trillion in fiscal stimulus on top of nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief in late December will ignite inflation.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell has played down these fears, citing three decades of lower and stable prices. There is also excess capacity in the labor market, with at least 19 million people on unemployment benefits. 
But Americans grounded at home by COVID-19 have accumulated excess savings, which can provide dry power for spending. Consumer spending on services remains about 3.3% lower than before the outbreak of the virus in the United States.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry fell to a nine-month low of 51.9 in February from a reading of 61.8 in January. But backlog orders jumped to a 55.2 last month from 50.9 in January. Export orders also rebounded strongly, which bodes well for the sector's growth.
The survey's index of services industry employment fell to 52.7 last month from a reading of 55.2 in January. 
That could temper expectations for an acceleration in job growth in February. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 180,000 jobs in February after gaining only 49,000 in January.

The economy has recovered 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic. Employment is not expected to return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024.

The contract rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most popular U.S. home loan, rose by 0.15 percentage point to 3.23% in the week ended Feb. 26, the Mortgage Bankers Association said on Wednesday.
That was the largest weekly increase since last March and marks the fourth straight weekly rise in borrowing costs. With the increase, mortgage rates have risen 0.37 percentage point from their record low of 2.86% early this year.
The MBA said its weekly index of mortgage applications rose 0.5% to 794.5, its first increase in four weeks.
""The housing market is entering the busy spring buying season with strong demand,"" said Joel Kan, MBA's Associate Vice President of Economic and Industry Forecasting. ""Purchase applications increased, with a rise in government applications – likely first-time buyers – pulling down the average loan size for the first time in six weeks.""
The housing market has been one of the persistent bright spots throughout the pandemic-induced recession, now a year old. But much of the strength has come from historically low interest rates, and economists had worried the rapid rise in Treasury yields in the last several weeks risked choking off that activity.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield, which heavily influences mortgage rates, has risen by roughly half a percentage point since early January to around 1.4%.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone economy is almost certainly in a double-dip recession as COVID-19 lockdowns continue to hammer the services industry, but hopes for a wider vaccine rollout has driven optimism to a three-year peak, a survey showed on Wednesday. 
IHS Markit's final February Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 48.8 from January's 47.8, above a flash reading of 48.1 but firmly below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
That increase was in large part due to near-record growth in manufacturing as factories in the 19-countries that use the euro have mostly remained open after restrictions were reimposed to curb high coronavirus cases. Governments have forced hospitality and entertainment venues to remain closed and encouraged citizens to stay at home. 
""The small upward revision to the euro zone's Composite PMI for February still leaves it consistent with another contraction in GDP in Q1,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
The euro zone economy contracted in the first two quarters of 2020 and a Reuters poll of economists last month forecast it would do so again in Q4 and the current quarter, saying risks to the already weak outlook were skewed to the downside. [ECILT/EU]
They cited delays to the European Union's vaccine roll-out, concerns about new coronavirus variants supporting current lockdowns, stalled economic activity and rising unemployment as serious threats.
The services sector in Germany, Europe's largest economy, continued to suffer under an extended coronavirus lockdown while French business activity fell to a three-month low. The Spanish and Italian services sectors also saw activity shrinking again.
In Britain, outside the euro zone and the European Union, economic output stabilised after a sharp fall in January before, its PMI showed, just hours before finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to set out his economic plans for the coming year.
SERVICES STRIFE
A PMI for the euro zone's dominant services industry, most affected by lockdowns, rose to 45.7 last month, ahead of January's 45.4 and the 44.7 flash estimate but still well below breakeven.
Demand fell for a seventh month, despite firms cutting their prices, yet services businesses did increase headcount - albeit marginally - for the first time since last February, just before Europe felt the first wave of the initial pandemic.
The services employment index rose to 50.2 from 49.8.
The EU's inoculation campaign has been marred by cuts in promised deliveries, rollout delays and some social resistance but there are expectations these will be ironed out and the composite future output index, which measures optimism, bounced to 67.0 from 64.2.

""The slow vaccine rollout and rising case numbers in France and Italy means that the lifting of restrictions is likely to be delayed, pushing much of the vaccine-related bounce in activity into Q3,"" Hinds said.

Hours before finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to set out his economic plans for the coming year, the IHS Markit/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index gave a reading of 49.6 for February, up from an eight-month low of 41.2 in January.
The figure means businesses reported broadly stable activity for last month after a steep deterioration early in the year, and is little changed from an initial flash estimate of 49.8.
The PMI for the services sector alone rose to a four-month high of 49.5 in February from January's eight-month low of 39.5, again in line with the initial flash estimate.
""Restrictions on travel, leisure and hospitality due to the national lockdown continued to curtail overall activity, but there were some pockets of growth in technology and business services,"" financial data company IHS Markit said.
Britain entered its third national coronavirus lockdown in early January, closing schools, non-essential shops and most other businesses open to the public, though people can still travel to work if needed. 
Last week Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out a path for easing the lockdown in England as vaccinations roll out rapidly. Schools will reopen next week but full restrictions on hospitality venues will not go until late June at the earliest.
Sunak is expected to set out further spending plans in a budget statement around 1230 GMT after providing almost 300 billion pounds of support during the past year.

Business optimism in the services PMI has risen to its highest since 2006 due to expectations of a return to normality. But many firms still reported difficulties from new, post-Brexit trading restrictions that took effect on Jan. 1.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index fell last month to 47.0 from 47.7 in January, better than an initial reading of 45.2 and bringing the index further away from the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction.
IHS Markit's PMI sub-index for the service sector fell to 45.6 from 47.3, better than an initial reading of 43.6.
With many business leaders fearing a new lockdown last month amid rising coronavirus cases, both indexes fell to the lowest level since November, when France was put under a second lockdown to contain the outbreak.
""February PMI data pointed to a continuation of the coronavirus-driven downturn seen throughout the winter months in the French private sector,"" IHS economist Eliot Kerr said. 
""Again, weakness was centred on services, where businesses are most hindered by restrictions related to the pandemic, with some firms remaining temporarily closed,"" Kerr added.

While France has so far been spared a third nationwide lockdown, the government is increasingly looking at targeted restrictions in regions where case numbers are rising particularly fast.

Investing.com – China’s services sector activity grew, but at its slowest pace in ten months, in February, a private sector survey said on Wednesday. This was as companies dealt with low demand and higher costs, prompting them to cut jobs,
The Caixin services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), released earlier in the day, stood at 51.5 against January’s 52 figure. It follows the Caixin manufacturing PMI, released earlier in the week, which was 50.9 against the 51.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and January’s 51.5 figure.
Data released earlier in the week by the National Bureau of Statistics said the manufacturing PMI released on Sunday was 50.6, below the 51.1 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and down from January’s 51.3 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was 51.4, also down from January’s 52.4.
The survey also said that a sub-index for employment, which stood at 47.9, slipped into contraction after six months of growth as companies laid off workers. New export business also dropped after three months of expansion.
The loss of momentum is attributable to a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country at the beginning of 2021. COVID-19 also continued to dent overseas demand.
“The momentum of post-epidemic services recovery further weakened … service providers cut staff to reduce costs as weakened market sentiment had a knock-on effect on the job market,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
The services sector, slower to recover initially from COVID-19 than the industrial sector, has also more vulnerable to the strict social distancing restrictions implemented to curb the outbreak. The Lunar New Year holidays in February, when many workers return to their hometowns from the cities, also saw limited travel thanks to COVID-19.
However, investors expect a strong rebound in full-year growth with China reporting no domestic COVID-19 cases since early February. Chinese services firms also remained optimistic about the year ahead, with business expectations over the next year rising from January."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.5, the lowest since April, from 52.0 in January but remained above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
A sub-index for employment stood at 47.9, slipping into contraction after six months of growth, as businesses laid off workers, the survey showed. New export business also shrank after expanding for three months.
The loss of momentum came as China faced coronavirus flare-ups at the start of the year, while overseas demand continued to be hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings were largely in line with an official survey released on Sunday.
""The momentum of post-epidemic services recovery further weakened,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in a statement accompanying the data release.

The contraction hitting the services sector comes as a state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures put in place in part to take pressure off the nation's medical system is set to end on Sunday.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at a seasonally adjusted 46.3, staying below the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion for the 13th month.
The survey result, which compared to the prior month's 46.1 and a preliminary 45.8 reading, was largely the result of a faster decline in new business and a continuing contraction in export business.
That showed demand remained in a fragile condition as the impact of the pandemic dragged on, said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Nevertheless, short-term uncertainty appears to be easing as vaccine rollouts begin,"" Bhatti said.
""Firms looked to prepare for a boost in demand by expanding employment levels for the first time since last February.""
Optimism was also seen in the outlook component of the survey, which showed businesses grew the most positive about the 12 months ahead since January 2018.

The composite PMI, which is calculated using both manufacturing and services, was 48.2 in February from the prior month's final reading of 47.1, also staying in contraction for a 13th month.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The monthly rate of producer price inflation in Brazil kicked off this year at its second highest since comparable records began more than six years ago, statistics agency IBGE said on Tuesday, with prices rising across all 24 activities surveyed.
Factory gate prices rose 3.36% in January from the month before, almost touching the 3.4% increase registered last October, the highest since the IBGE series began in 2014. 
The annual rate of producer price inflation in January was 23%, IBGE said. 
The jump in wholesale prices at the factory gate in January was led by a 10.7% surge in mining industry inflation, which accounted for 0.59 percentage points of the overall rise. 
Annual inflation in this segment was 52.9%, the highest of all 24 activities surveyed.
Gasoline and related prices rose 5.3% in the month, accounting for 0.45 percentage points of the overall rise and the second biggest single contributor, IBGE said.
The third most important driver was a 6.1% rise in metals industry inflation, accounting for 0.4 percentage points of the total rise. These prices rose almost 40% over the previous year.

A growing number of economists now think the central bank will raise as early as interest rates next month because consumer price inflation expectations are starting to drift above the bank's central year-end target of 3.75%.

MADRID (Reuters) - The number of jobless people in Spain rose above 4 million for the first time in five years in February, official data showed on Tuesday, as COVID-19 restrictions ravage the ailing economy.
Since the onset of the pandemic, Spain has lost more than 400,000 jobs, around two-thirds of them in the hospitality sector, which has struggled with limits on opening hours and capacity as well as an 80% slump in international tourism.
Jobless claims rose by 1.12% from a month earlier, or by 44,436 people to 4,008,789, Labour Ministry data showed, the fifth consecutive monthly increase in unemployment.
That number was 23.5% higher than in February 2020, the last month before the pandemic took hold in Spain. 
""The rise in unemployment, caused by the third wave, is bad news, reflecting the structural flaws of the labour market that are accentuated by the pandemic,"" Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz tweeted.
Restrictions vary sharply from region to region in Spain, with some shutting down all hospitality businesses, though Madrid has taken a particularly relaxed approach and kept bars and restaurants open.
A total of 30,211 positions were lost over the month, seasonally adjusted data from the Social Security Ministry showed. It was the first month more positions were closed than created since Spain emerged from its strict first-wave lockdown in May. 
Still, the number of people supported by Spain's ERTE furlough scheme across Spain fell by nearly 29,000 to 899,383 in February.
""These figures have remained more or less stable since September, indicating that the second and third waves of the pandemic have had a much smaller effect than the first in this regard,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Hotels, bars and restaurants and air travel are the sectors with the highest proportion of furloughed workers, it added.
Tourism dependent regions like the Canary and Balearic Islands have been particularly hard hit, with the workforce contracting by more than 6% since last February in both archipelagos.

The last time the number of jobless in Spain hit 4 million was in April 2016.

The Labour Office said the number of people out of work rose by 9,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.752 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a fall of 13,000.
""Kurzarbeit (shortened working hours) continues to secure employment on a large scale and prevent unemployment,"" Labour Office chief Detlef Scheele said in a statement, adding: ""Individual sectors are feeling the effects of the lockdown.""
Germany has been in lockdown since November, and measures were tightened in mid-December, as it battles a second wave of the virus. Chancellor Angela Merkel has said new variants of COVID-19 risk a third wave of infections.
The unemployment rate remained unchanged compared with the previous month at 6.0%.
The labour agency said some 2.39 million employees were on shortened working hours in December under the government's Kurzarbeit scheme designed to avoid mass layoffs during downturns by offering companies subsidies to keep workers on the payroll.

After peaking at some 6 million last April, the number of people on Kurzarbeit fell before rising again in November as lockdown measures kicked in, the Office said.

House prices rose 6.9% in annual terms in February from 6.4% in January, Nationwide said, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a slowdown to 5.6%.
In February alone, prices rose 0.7%, more than reversing a 0.2% decline in January and bucking expectations for a 0.3% drop.
Nationwide said the outlook for the housing market was particularly uncertain right now, with the potential for it to be boosted further by Sunak when he presents his annual budget on Wednesday. 
But the market could slow because of a weakening labour market, the lender said.
Sunak looks set to extend a temporary cut to property purchase taxes until June and announce a new mortgage guarantee scheme for first-time buyers, according to media reports.
Samuel Tombs, economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics consultancy, said he doubted any new scheme would solve affordability problems faced by first-time buyers.

The Federal Statistics Office said retail sales fell 4.5% on the month in real terms after an upwardly revised decline of 9.1% in December. The January reading undershot a Reuters forecast for a decline of 0.3%.
""This decline can be explained by the ongoing coronavirus lockdown, which meant a closure of many retail stores since Dec. 16, 2020,"" the statistics office said.
The end of a temporary sales tax cut may also have contributed as many consumers made big ticket purchases before the end of 2020 to save money.
Fashion retail sales plunged 76.6% year-on-year, while sales of groceries were up 4.3% year-on-year as supermarkets and convenience stores remained open.
Online retailers continued to benefit from shifting consumer habits with sales up 31.7%.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state premiers closed most shops and services in mid-December after a partial lockdown for bars, restaurants and entertainment venues failed to push down infections.

Merkel and state premiers are due to meet again on Wednesday to discuss a gradual easing of lockdown measures that are currently in place until at least March 7.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity increased to a three-year high in February amid a surge in new orders, but factories continued to face higher costs for raw materials and other inputs amid labor shortages at suppliers as the pandemic drags on.
The acceleration reported by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Monday was despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, which has hurt production at automobile plants. Other data showed construction spending surged to a record high in January, boosted by strong private and public outlays. 
The reports were the latest indications of strong economic performance early in the first quarter, thanks to nearly $900 billion in additional COVID-19 relief money from the government and a drop in new coronavirus infections and hospitalizations.
""We are looking at an economy that is picking up steam,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""But we are not talking high inflation, just levels that reflect a solidly growing economy.""
The ISM said its index of national factory activity rebounded to a reading of 60.8 last month from 58.7 in January. That was the highest level since February 2018. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to 58.8 in February.

Manufacturing is being driven by strong demand for goods like electronics and furniture, as 23.2% of the labor force works from home because of the virus. Demand could, however, shift back to services in the summer as more Americans get vaccinated, and slow manufacturing activity from current levels. 
But the year-long pandemic has gummed up the supply chain, boosting production costs for manufacturers. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to a reading of 86.0, the highest since July 2008, from 82.1 in January. 
This follows data last month showing a surge in consumers' near-term inflation expectations, and fits in with views that inflation will accelerate in the months ahead. Economists are, however, split on whether the anticipated spike in price pressures will be transitory or not.
U.S. Treasury yields have risen, with investors betting that extremely accommodative monetary and fiscal policy will boost inflation. The Federal Reserve is pumping cash into the economy through bond purchases, while Congress is considering President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue plan. 
There is also ample capacity in the labor market, with at least 19 million people on unemployment benefits. But Americans grounded at home by COVID-19 have accumulated excess savings, which can provide a powerful tailwind to spending.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending increased 1.7% to $1.521 trillion in January, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002, after rising 1.1% in December.

Reports last month showed solid January consumer spending, manufacturing output, building permits and home sales. After Monday's data, the Atlanta Fed boosted its first-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 10% annualized rate from an 8.8% pace. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. 
WIDE-SCALE SHORTAGES
The ISM reported that suppliers continued to ""struggle to deliver,"" because of transportation challenges and a shortage of labor. It said it did not expect these constraints to ease ""until employment levels and factory operations can return to normal across the entire supply chain."" The ISM's measure of supplier deliveries has increased every month since last August. 
Electrical equipment, appliances and components producers reported ""wide-scale"" shortages and described the situation as ""out of control."" Manufacturers of chemical products said supply chains were ""depleted,"" and expected the recent deep freeze in the Gulf Coast to worsen the shortages problem.
Food, beverage and tobacco products manufacturers said they had ""experienced a higher rate of delinquent shipments from our ingredient suppliers in the last month."" They anticipated a surge in orders as restaurants reopen. 
Makers of wood products said ""prices are rising so rapidly that many are wondering if the situation is sustainable."" 
Sixteen industries including electrical equipment, appliances and components, primary metals and paper, as well as computer and electronic products reported growth last month. But printing and related support activities as well as petroleum and coal products industries contracted.
""Manufacturing is doing well but it will not be smooth sailing over the next few months because of supply-chain disruptions, slow delivery times and a global shortage of semiconductors,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. 
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 64.8 last month from 61.1 in January. Factories also received more export orders and order backlogs swelled. A measure of customer inventories fell to the lowest level since December 2009, while stocks at manufacturers remained lean, which bodes well for future production. 
As a result, factories stepped up hiring last month. The survey's manufacturing employment gauge rose to 54.4, the highest reading since March 2019, from 52.6 in January. 

That offers cautious optimism that employment growth picked up last month after nonfarm payrolls increased by only 49,000 jobs in January. The economy has recovered 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic.

The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending increased 1.7% to $1.521 trillion, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002. Data for December was revised slightly higher to show construction outlays rising 1.1% instead of 1.0% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would increase 0.8% in January. Construction spending accelerated 5.8% on a year-on-year basis in January. Construction spending accounts for about 4% of gross domestic product.
Spending on private construction projects increased 1.7%, lifted by investment in single-family homebuilding amid cheaper mortgages and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low-density areas. That followed a 1.5% advance in December.
Spending on residential projects rose 2.5% after surging 3.8% in December. Outlays on nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling rose 0.4%.

Spending on public construction projects increased 1.7%. State and local government outlays gained 1.3%, while federal government spending soared 6.8%.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The pace of expansion in Brazil's manufacturing sector picked up again in February after three months of deceleration, a survey of purchasing managers' activity showed on Monday, driven by strong increases in new orders and production.
Employment also picked up as firms looked to meet rising demand, while supply constraints pushed price pressures back up again, IHS Markit's latest monthly purchasing managers index (PMI) report showed.
IHS Markit's headline manufacturing PMI rose to 58.4 in February from 56.5 in January, marking the ninth consecutive month of growth.
A reading above 50.0 marks expansion, while a reading below signifies contraction. The series was launched in 2006.
""The manufacturing sector in Brazil has regained momentum after a stuttering start to 2021, but the speed of recovery remains slower than in the second half of last year,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.
""Improving conditions were driven by a strong rise in new order volumes, especially from domestic clients. Goods producers sought to ramp up production schedules and staff numbers in response to greater demand, but supply constraints acted as a brake on growth,"" he said.
IHS Markit's new orders sub-index rose to 56.0 from 54.8 in January, the first rise in six months, while the employment index rose to 53.8 from 51.2.
The future output index rose, IHS Markit said, and the output prices index rose to a three-month high.
A growing number of economists say Brazil's economy will shrink in the first quarter, dragged down by a second wave of COVID-19 and the end of emergency cash transfers to millions of poor people on Dec. 31. 

Inflation remains sticky too, presenting a further headache for consumers, businesses and policymakers.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's economy grew 5.9% in the fourth quarter https://tmsnrt.rs/3dVombP and 1.8% in 2020 as a whole, annual data showed on Monday, emerging as one of only a few globally to avoid a contraction due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Propelled by a burst of credit in mid-2020, fourth-quarter GDP grew 1.7% from the previous quarter on a seasonally and calendar-adjusted basis, the Turkish Statistical Institute said.
A surge in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the second half of the year that surpassed Turkey's potential rate was driven by a near doubling of lending by state banks to face down the initial wave of the virus.
While outperforming all emerging market (EM) and G20 peers except China, Turkey's growth came at a price: The cheap lending accelerated a record drop in the lira, drew down the country's foreign currency reserves and helped push inflation to 15%. Also, few jobs were created.
Graphic: Turkey grew in 2020 despite pandemic - https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-ECONOMY/GDP-ANNUAL/oakperrkbvr/chart.png
The recovery was ""unbalanced and ultimately exacerbated some of the country's external vulnerabilities,"" said Jason Tuvey, senior EM economist at Capital Economics.
Financial sector activity surged more than 21% last year, driving overall growth, the data showed. Tourism and other services activity dropped by 4.3% and the construction sector, an engine of growth in years past, shrank 3.5%.
The lira firmed to 7.351 against the dollar after the GDP data and was 1% stronger on the day.
The volatile currency tumbled last week after a rally that began in early November when Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan promised a new market-friendly economic era. A new central bank chief has since hiked interest rates, cutting credit dramatically.
Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan, appointed in November, said on Twitter Monday that Turkey would prioritise price stability this year. Analysts say the economy should expand by roughly 5% in 2021 despite tight monetary policy.
In a Reuters poll, GDP was forecast to have expanded 7.1% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2020, despite new curfews and curbs on the service sector to address a second COVID-19 wave, and 2.3% for the whole year.
Graphic: Turkey's economy kept up hot growth in Q4 - https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-ECONOMY/GROWTH/qmyvmwwzjvr/chart.png
World economies mostly contracted and tumbled into recessions last year, with emerging and developing nations shrinking by some 2.4% according to the International Monetary Fund.
The major EM economy has cooled in recent years https://tmsnrt.rs/3r40BSx from an average 5% growth rate in the last two decades. The rate plunged by 10.3% annually in the second quarter as the pandemic bit, but rebounded sharply by 6.3% in the third.
Ankara is considering lifting some of the latest virus restrictions as of this month.

Tuvey of Capital Economics said the shift in November to more orthodox policies helped Turkey avoid ""a full-blown balance of payments crisis"", and he predicted a sustained recovery may not come until the second half of this year.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2021 04:21AM ET</span>",Strong exports lift German factory activity to three-year high in February: PMI,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Higher demand from China, the United States and Europe drove growth in German factory activity to its highest level in more than three years in February, brightening the outlook for Europe's largest economy, a survey showed on Monday.
IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, jumped to 60.7 from 57.1 in January.
It was the highest reading since January 2018 and came in slightly better than the initial ""flash"" figure of 60.6.
Factories have been humming along during the pandemic on higher foreign demand, helping the German economy avoid a contraction in the last quarter of 2020 and offsetting a drop in consumer spending amid a partial lockdown to contain COVID-19.
Many manufacturers reported higher demand from Asia, especially China, as well as the United States and European countries, with export sales posting their biggest increase since December 2017, the survey showed.
Phil Smith, Principal Economist at IHS Markit, said supply chain pressures intensified as more firms reported delays than ever before in nearly 25 years of data collection.
""There looks to be further upward pressure on inflation in the German economy from supply bottlenecks and a subsequent surge in manufacturing input costs,"" Smith noted.
The survey suggested that supply disruption is making it more difficult to replenish stocks, which could complicate production in the coming months, he cautioned.
""Nevertheless, the overriding sentiment for the longer-term outlook is optimism, with a record number of manufacturers expecting to see output rise over the next 12 months.""

Still, economists expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter of this year due to a stricter lockdown, which has shut most shops and services since mid-December, and freezing temperatures that slowed construction activity in February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone factory activity raced along in February thanks to soaring demand, a survey showed on Monday, although the burst of business led to a shortage of raw materials and a spike in input costs.
Restrictions imposed across the continent to try to quell the spread of the coronavirus have shuttered vast swathes of the bloc's dominant services industry, meaning it has fallen to manufacturers to support the economy.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to a three-year high of 57.9 in February from January's 54.8, ahead of the initial 57.7 ""flash"" estimate and one of the highest readings in the survey's 20-year history.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good guide to economic health, climbed to 57.6 from 54.6, well above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
""Manufacturing is appearing as an increasingly bright spot in the euro zone's economy so far this year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The solid manufacturing expansion is clearly helping to offset ongoing virus-related weakness in many consumer-facing sectors, alleviating the impact of recent lockdown measures in many countries and helping to limit the overall pace of economic contraction.""
A Reuters poll last month showed the bloc was in a double dip recession and that the economy would contract 0.8% this quarter after shrinking 6.9% in 2020 on an annual basis. [ECILT/EU]
Rocketing demand for manufactured goods pushed factories to increase staffing levels for the first time in nearly two years.
But lockdown measures disrupted supply chains and factories struggled to obtain raw materials, leading to a big increase in delivery times.
""The growth spurt has brought its own problems, however, with demand for inputs not yet being met by supply. Shipping delays and shortages of materials are being widely reported, and led to near-record supply chain delays,"" Williamson said.

Those shortages allowed suppliers to hike their prices at the fastest rate in almost a decade. The input prices PMI bounced to 73.9 from 68.3.

France's manufacturing sector has in recent months outperformed the country's more dominant services sector industry.
While services businesses, which includes bars, hotels and restaurants, have been hit by restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, manufacturers have benefited from increased output and a rise in orders.

IHS Markit added that February saw the biggest increase in employment in France's manufacturing sector since November 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Solid demand for technology goods drove extended growth in Asia's factories in February, but a slowdown in China underscored the challenges facing the region as it seeks a sustainable recovery from the shattering COVID-19 pandemic blow.
The vaccine rollouts globally and pick-up in demand provided optimism for a vast number of businesses that had grappled for months with a cash-flow crunch and falling profits. 
In Japan, manufacturing activity expanded at the fastest pace in over two years while South Korea's exports rose for a fourth straight month in February, suggesting the region's export-reliant economies were benefiting from robust global trade.
On the flip side, China's factory activity grew at the slowest pace in nine months in February, hit by a domestic flare-up of COVID-19 and soft demand from countries under renewed lock-down measures.
""In all, the softer pace of activity in today's (Chinese) manufacturing print is likely to be temporary, and we expect the growth momentum to pick back up on the back of a broadening out of the domestic demand recovery and a pickup in global demand,"" said Erin Xin, an economist at HSBC.
""However, household consumption, while recovering, has not yet fully reached pre-pandemic levels of growth due to continued labour market pressure.""
China was the first major economy to lead the recovery from the COVID-19 shock, so any signs of prolonged cooling in Asia's engine of growth will likely be a cause for concern.
With the global rebound still in early days, however, analysts say the outlook was brightening as companies increased output to restock inventory on hopes vaccine rollouts will normalise economic activity.
""The recovery in durable-goods demand is continuing, which is creating a positive cycle for manufacturers in Asia,"" said Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan economics as Oxford Economics.
""As vaccine rollouts ease uncertainties over the outlook, capital expenditure will gradually pick up. That will benefit Japan, which is strong in exports of capital goods,"" he said.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.9 in February, the lowest level since last May but still above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.
That was in line with official manufacturing PMI that showed factory activity in the world's second-largest economy expanded in February at the weakest pace since May last year.
Activity in other Asian giants remained brisk.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to 51.4 in February from the prior month's 49.8 reading, marking the fastest expansion since December 2018, data showed on Monday.
In South Korea, a regional exports bellwether, shipments jumped 9.5% in February from a year earlier for its fourth straight month of increase on continued growth in memory chip and car sales.
India's factory activity expanded for the seventh straight month in February on strong demand and increased output, though a spike in input costs could weigh on corporate profits ahead.

The Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam also saw manufacturing activity expand in February, a sign the region was gradually recovering from the initial hit of the pandemic.

The slowdown in the manufacturing sector underscores the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery in China, although domestic COVID-19 cases have since been stamped out and analysts expect a strong rebound in full-year growth.
The results back an official survey released over the weekend showing China's factory activity expanded at the weakest pace since last May.
February also saw the Lunar New Year holidays, when many workers return to their hometowns, although this year saw far fewer trips amid coronavirus fears.

""Overseas demand continued to drag down overall demand...Surveyed manufacturers highlighted fallout from domestic flare-ups of Covid-19 in the winter as well as the overseas pandemic,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the data.
A sub-index for production fell to 51.9, the slowest pace of expansion since April last year, while another sub-index for new orders fell to 51.0, the lowest since May.
Export orders shrank for the second month. Factories laid off workers for the third month, and at a faster pace, with Wang noting ""companies were not in a hurry to fill vacancies.""
An index of confidence in the year ahead rose however to 63.0, the highest since October. Input and output prices continued to rise albeit at a slower pace.

Investing.com – China’s economic recovery from COVID-19 hit another bump in the road in February, as factories were shut during the Lunar New Year holidays and restrictive measures to curb an outbreak of the virus disrupted what is normally the country’s busiest travel season.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Sunday showed that February’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 50.6, below the 51.1 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and down from January’s 52.8 reading. The non-manufacturing PMI was 51.4, also down from January’s 52.4.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI is due later in the day, and the Caixin services PMI will be released later in the week.
The manufacturing PMI fell to a nine-month low, while the non-manufacturing gauge dropped to its lowest level in around a year. However, all the indexes remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion, albeit at a slower pace.
The NBS accredited the manufacturing slump to holiday closures, although the retailing, catering and entertainment sectors remained relatively active.
The week-long Lunar New Year holiday usually distorts manufacturing activity, as factories and businesses close to allow workers to travel back to their hometowns in what is the largest movement of people seen during the year.
However, restrictions put into place due to the most recent COVID-19 outbreak caused many people to avoid travel, and instead spend at local shops, restaurants and cinemas.
“The larger-than-expected declines in China’s February purchasing managers’ indexes should not cause alarm. They reflect seasonal weakness and effects of the virus surge before the Lunar New Year. What they don’t fully capture, though, is the stabilization that started to take hold late in the month,” Bloomberg chief Asia economist Chang Shu said.
The data also showed that commodity prices continue to rise, pushing up input costs above the 60-mark for a fourth consecutive month in February. Employment for both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors also remained below the 50-mark, an indication that the economy is still bleeding jobs."

Last month's reading was still far higher than the 36.0 recorded during the initial lockdown of the economy in April. The manufacturing sector has been allowed to operate during subsequent lockdowns.
Output and new orders fell for the second month running while supply chains remained under severe pressure, with Britain's exit from the European Union's trading orbit widely cited as the main cause of delays.
Rising administration and transport costs as a result of Brexit as well as upward pressure on raw materials prices are also generating more inflationary pressure, they added.
However, employment in the sector continued to rise and sentiment remained strong as firms looked beyond the crisis to a revival in demand later in 2021.
""Tight COVID lockdown restrictions, both here and elsewhere, are creating a challenging backdrop for businesses, with firms reporting weak demand and thus falling new orders in Ireland and from the UK,"" said AIB chief economist Oliver Mangan.

At 174,010, ads were at their highest level since October 2018.

The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) jumped to a seasonally adjusted 51.4 in February from the prior month's 49.8 reading.
The rise in the headline figure, which compared to a preliminary 50.6 reading, marked the fastest expansion since December 2018.
That meant manufacturing activity was well above the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion thanks to strong improvements in output and orders.
Overall, new orders rose at the fastest pace since October 2018, while output grew for the first time since December 2018 after which the economy was hit by the U.S.-China trade war and the COVID-19 crisis.
The PMI survey was in line with January output and fourth-quarter gross domestic product data released last month that showed Japan's manufacturing sector has managed to weather emergency coronavirus measures at home, mainly thanks to robust overseas demand for tech components.
It also showed, however, that producers are facing a jump in input prices, which rose at their fastest pace since February 2019, pressuring their profit margins.
""Concern has been building throughout the Japanese manufacturing sector regarding ongoing supply chain disruption,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, adding that it caused raw materials prices to rise.
""Cost burdens faced by firms rose at the sharpest pace in two years, which has partially translated into higher charges for clients to cover margins,"" he added.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian home prices surged by the most since August 2003 in February as record low borrowing rates and government incentives lure more buyers into the market, raising fears of overheating.
Housing values rose across each of the capital cities and regional Australia, the first such synchronised growth in more than a decade, data from property consultant CoreLogic showed on Monday.
The stellar recovery in the housing market follows a COVID-19-led crunch early last year and provides a much-needed windfall to consumer wealth and confidence, with the country's housing stock already valued at A$7.2 trillion ($5.49 trillion) by September.
The CoreLogic data showed national home prices rose 2.1% in February, from January when they added 0.9%. Values were up 4.0% on the previous February.
Prices across the major capitals rose 2% in January from the previous month, to be up 2.6% on the year.
The regional market surged 2.1% in the month and 9.4% for the year as city dwellers, smarting from coronavirus lockdowns, sought more living space and houses with gardens.
Sydney and Melbourne were among the strongest markets last month, recording a 2.5% and 2.1% lift in home values, respectively, as Australia's two largest cities catch up from weaker performance throughout 2020.

767,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2021 04:10AM ET</span>","China's factory activity expands at a slower pace in February, misses expectations: official PMI","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded in February at a slower pace than a month earlier, hitting the lowest level since last May and missing market expectations after brief COVID-19-related disruptions earlier in the year.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 50.6 from 51.3 in January, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Sunday, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
Analysts had expected it to decline to 51.1.
Chinese factory activity normally goes dormant during the Lunar New Year break as workers return to their home towns. This year, the government appealed to workers to remain local to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Generally, China's economic recovery has been gathering pace due to robust exports, pent-up demand and government stimulus.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders was 48.8 in February compared with 50.2 in January, slipping back into contraction after months boosted by overseas demand.
A sub-index for activity among small firms stood at 48.3 in February versus 49.4 a month earlier. Smaller firms were more affected by the seasonal effects of the Lunar New Year, said Zhao Qinghe, an official with the NBS in comments released with the data. 
A sub-index for employment in the official PMI stood at 48.1 in February, down from January's 48.4 as firms laid off more workers and at a faster pace.
Still, some manufacturing sector firms are seeing increasing pressure from rising labour costs and a shortage of workers, said Zhao.
China's factory gate prices rose on year in January for the first time in a year, as months of strong manufacturing growth pushed raw material costs higher.
China eked out 2.3% economic growth last year. This year, the government may avoid setting a growth target for fear of provincial economies feeling pressured to take on more debt, policy sources previously told Reuters.
China will reinforce policy support for foreign trade and ensure the smooth operation of supply chains, its new commerce minister said earlier this week.

In the services sector, activity expanded for the 11th consecutive month but at the slowest pace in a year.

""The unprecedented shift in the government’s financial results reflects the severe deterioration in the economic situation and temporary measures implemented ... as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak during this period,"" it said in a statement.
Revenues dropped by 15.6% reflecting a broad-based decline including lower tax revenues. Program expenses, meanwhile, jumped 86.1% largely due to emergency transfers to individuals, businesses and the provinces. 
On a monthly basis, Canada posted a deficit of C$16.15 billion in December 2020, compared to the C$782 million surplus recorded in December 2019.
Monthly revenues were down 2.4% on a decline in other revenues, which include Crown corporation profits and returns on investments among other things. Program expenses climbed 59.9%, again on COVID-19 response measures.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",Fiscal stimulus fires up U.S. consumer spending; inflation benign,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased by the most in seven months in January as the government doled out more pandemic relief money to low-income households and new COVID-19 infections dropped, positioning the economy for faster growth in the first quarter.
Despite the strong rebound in consumer spending reported by the Commerce Department on Friday, price pressures were muted. Inflation is being closely watched amid concerns from some quarters that President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 recovery package could cause the economy to overheat.
The plan, being considered by the U.S. Congress, would be on top of a rescue package worth nearly $900 billion approved by the government in late December. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has played down the inflation fears, citing three decades of lower and stable prices.
""Thanks to Washington, the economic outlook in the near future is sunny,"" said Sung Won Sohn, finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, jumped 2.4% last month. That was the biggest gain since last June and ended two-straight monthly declines. Personal income shot up 10%, the largest increase since last April when the government disbursed the first round of stimulus checks. Income rose 0.6% in December. 
Graphic: Personal consumption - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvoeeaqvd/perscons.png
The recent stimulus package included $600 checks to mostly low-income and some middle-income Americans. The package also extended a government-funded weekly unemployment subsidy as well as benefits for millions of people who do not qualify for state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their six months of eligibility. These benefits expire in mid-March.
The consumer spending report added to upbeat data this month on manufacturing output, building permits and home sales. 
Consumers bought motor vehicles, recreation goods, food and beverages. They also boosted spending on services such as hotel accommodations and restaurants, as well as doctor visits. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rebounding 2.5% in January and income accelerating 9.5%.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending increased 2% last month after decreasing 0.8% in December. But robust consumer spending is drawing in imports. 
In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said the goods trade deficit increased 0.7% to $83.7 billion last month, with imports outpacing a rise in exports. The department also reported a 0.6% decrease in retail inventories, though stocks at wholesalers surged 1.3%.
The drag on economic growth from the widening goods trade deficit and slower pace of inventory accumulation will likely be blunted by the strong consumer spending. 
Following this month's slew of solid reports,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised its first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate to an 8.1% annualized rate from a 7.3% pace. Growth forecasts for the quarter were boosted last week from as low as a 2.3% pace. The economy grew at a 4.1% rate in the fourth quarter. 
There are indications that the White House's massive stimulus package could be fully approved next month. It would send additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and extend the government safety net for the unemployed. 
Further gains in consumer spending are likely, though winter storms, which wreaked havoc in Texas and other parts of the densely populated South this month, could slow momentum. Daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have dropped to levels last seen before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, while the pace of vaccination is picking up. 
While a third report from the University of Michigan showed its consumer sentiment index dipping this month from January, a survey from the Conference Board this week showed an improvement in confidence among households. 
Graphic: Consumer sentiment - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwzzjmvw/umich.png
Inflation was benign last month. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy component rose 0.3% after a similar gain in December. In the 12 months through January, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5% after advancing 1.4% in December. 
The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure for its 2% target, a flexible average. 
Graphic: Inflation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdpzeekovw/inflation.png 
Powell this week told lawmakers that the U.S. central bank would keep interest rates low and continue to pump money into the economy through bond purchases ""at least at the current pace until we make substantial further progress towards our goals (maximum employment and inflation).""
There is ample slack in the labor market, with at least 19 million people on unemployment benefits. 
Income last month was boosted by a 52% surge in government transfers. It was also supported by a 0.7% rise in wages. Excluding the government largesse income at the disposal of households after inflation fell 0.5%. 
Some of the stimulus money sent to households was stashed away, hoisting the saving rate to 20.5% from 13.4% in December.

""We expect an additional stimulus package passed in March to raise the savings rate further, adding to a powerful tailwind of buying power that has been building among U.S. households, ready to be deployed as the economy is reopening,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's economy returned to growth in the three months to December and the recovery is expected to gather pace as consumers and investors shake off the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, economists said.
Fiscal and monetary policy could boost India's recovery prospects, they said, amid signs of a pick-up in consumer demand and government spending. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched plans for a massive vaccination drive, while outlining a slew of tax incentives to boost the manufacturing sector.
Gross domestic product grew 0.4% in October-December compared with the same period a year earlier, data released by the National Statistics Office on Friday showed. That compared with revised contractions of 7.3% in July-September and 24.4% in April-June.
Investment recorded its first growth since December 2019, growing at 2.6% compared to a revised 6.8% fall in the previous quarter, while weakness in consumer demand eased. 
Consumer spending - the main driver of the economy - dropped 2.4 % year-on-year in Oct-December compared to an 11.3% fall in the previous quarter, data showed.
The economy has returned to the ""pre-pandemic times of positive growth rates"", a finance ministry statement said after the release of the GDP data, which it said reflected a continued V-shaped recovery. 
""Significant recovery in manufacturing and construction augurs well for the support these sectors are expected to provide to growth in 2021/22,"" said the statement, which also cautioned that India is not yet beyond ""the danger of the pandemic"". 
Economists have raised their forecasts for the current fiscal year and 2021-22, expecting a pick-up in government spending, consumer demand and a resumption of most economic activities curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Annual growth of 3.9% in the farm sector and 1.6% in manufacturing during the three months to December raised hopes of an early recovery as the government rolls out plans to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to India's 1.4 billion people.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has slashed its repo rate by a total of 115 basis points since March 2020 to cushion the economic shock of the pandemic, has projected growth of 10.5% in the fiscal year that starts in April.
SHORT-TERM RISKS 
Some analysts warn, however, that a recent rise in crude oil prices and a surge of COVID-19 cases in parts of the country may pose risks to the nascent recovery.
""There are some risks that need to be watched, including rising commodity prices,""said Sakshi Gupta, senior economist at HDFC Bank, adding that the pace of recovery in the informal sector and contact-intensive services could be impacted by the resurgence of domestic virus cases.
India also revised annual GDP estimates for the fiscal year, predicting an 8.0% contraction, deeper than an earlier estimate of -7.7%. 
Sectors such as retail, airlines, hotels and hospitality are still reeling from the impact of the pandemic.

The central bank left the repo rate unchanged at 4% earlier this month, saying the growth outlook had improved and inflation was expected to remain within the RBI's targeted range over the next few quarters.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's unemployment rate ended last year at 13.9%, figures showed on Friday, extending a recent dip as workers returning to the labor market found jobs, but the average jobless rate in 2020 was the highest since comparable records began in 2012.
That was down from 14.1% in the three months to November, statistics agency IBGE said, in line with the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and slipping further from the record 14.6% in the three months to September.
Brazil's unemployment rate ended 2019 at 11.0%.
The average unemployment rate last year was 13.5%, IBGE said, up from 11.9% the year before and the highest since the series began eight years ago.
The IBGE figures showed 86.2 million Brazilians had work, up 4.5%, or 3.7 million people, from the July-September period, although still down 8.9%, or 8.4 million people, from the same period a year earlier.
The number of Brazilians officially unemployed in the three months to December dipped slightly to 13.9 million from 14.1 million in the prior three-month period, IBGE said, but that was up almost 20% from a year ago.
The under-employment rate fell to 28.7% from 30.3% in the July-September period, while the average underemployment rate last year was a record 28.1%, IBGE said.
The number of under-employed fell by 1.1 million to 32 million, IBGE said. That was still 22.5% higher than the same period a year earlier, or up almost 6 million more people.
The workforce stood at 100.1 million people, up 3.5 million from the three months through September, and the number of people out of the workforce entirely fell by 2.3 million to 76.3 million, IBGE said.

Compared with a year earlier, however, the workforce is still down 6.1 million people, and there are almost 11 million more people out of the workforce completely, IBGE noted.

774,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 11:40PM ET</span>",China's factory activity growth likely moderated during Feb holiday lull: Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity likely grew at a slightly slower rate in February as factories closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, a Reuters poll showed, although growth is expected to remain firm, buoyed by an early resumption of production.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) is expected to dip marginally to 51.1 in February from 51.3 in January, according to the median forecast of 20 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
Chinese factories typically scale back operations or close for lengthy periods around the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in the middle of February this year. 
However, the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the winter had prompted local governments and companies to dissuade workers from travelling back to their hometowns, giving a boost to the earlier-than-usual resumption of production at many factories, analysts say. 
""Although government COVID-19 prevention measures may constrain some manufacturing activities in the near-term, the fact that a majority of migrant workers stayed in their workplace cities for the holiday should facilitate an earlier resumption of business activity following the holiday this year,"" said analysts at Nomura in a note to client on Thursday.
Wang Zhishen, a migrant worker from Gansu, told Reuters that his factory, a manufacturer of logistics boxes in the manufacturing hub of Dongguan, only closed for three days during the holiday, thanks to overwhelming businesses. Lured by the 1,500-yuan cash subsidy his factory offered, he chose to work through the holiday.
The Chinese economy has largely shaken off the gloom from the COVID-19 health crisis, with consumers opening up their wallets after months of hesitation. Growth is now set to rebound sharply this quarter, also helped by the low base effect of a year ago.
The country has successfully curbed the domestic transmission of the COVID-19 virus in northern China, with the national health authority reporting zero new local cases for the 11th straight day. Cities that were on lockdown have since vowed to push for a work resumption at full speed.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Sunday.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Monday. Analysts expect the headline reading will dip slightly to 51.4 from 51.5 in January.

“Without a certain pace of expansion, the quality of the economy doesn’t have support,” Zhang Liqun, a researcher at the Development Research Center of China’s State Council, said in an interview with the state-run China Internet Information Center. “I think it is necessary to set a goal for economic growth this year, and the conditions are in place for it,” he said, referring to the nation’s strong recovery from the Covid-19 outbreak.
Zhang’s intervention in a debate about whether Beijing should abandon GDP growth targeting for a second year comes a week before the publication of the government’s annual work report, which is widely expected not to include any target. China’s government reports will be released next Friday and these will include the budget and plans for the economy in 2021, and those targets for fiscal revenue, bank credit growth, employment and income growth are all closely linked to how fast the economy expands, Zhang said.
“The market in general is not expecting a GDP target from the meetings,” Iris Pang, chief China economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Hong Kong wrote in a report this week.
Zhang said the lack of a GDP target last year was mainly due to uncertainty due to the pandemic, but he expects China’s economy to grow around 8% this year as China has the coronavirus outbreak under control. That’s similar to the consensus view, which forecasts growth of 8.4% this year.
The Development Research Center is an think-tank affiliated with China’s top government body the State Council. In the past it has produced influential reports on China’s long-term economic development, partnering with institutions such as the World Bank.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 08:35PM ET</span>","Japan's January factory output rises for first time in three months, retail sales drop","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose for the first time in three months in January thanks to a pickup in global demand, in a welcome sign for an economy still looking to shake off the drag of the coronavirus pandemic.
But retail sales, a key gauge of consumer spending, posted their second straight month of declines in January as emergency measures taken in response to the pandemic hit consumption.
Official data released on Friday showed factory output advanced 4.2% in January, boosted by sharp rises in production of electronic parts and general-purpose machinery, as well as a smaller increase in car output.
""Manufacturers will continue to increase output over the near term as long as there won't be any big shock,"" said Taro Saito, executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute.
While economic growth will likely be negative in the first quarter, the strength in manufacturing would offset the negative impact of a state of emergency at home, which is mainly affecting the services sector, he said.
The rise in output, which followed a 1.0% fall the previous month, was largely in line with a 4.0% gain forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expect output to grow 2.1% in February, followed by a 6.1% decline in March.
The government kept its assessment of industrial production unchanged, saying it was picking up.
Factory output fell in November and December as a rebound in car production ended on sagging global demand, but since then strong demand for tech-making equipment and electronic goods has helped turn the tide.
Still, some analysts worry that Japan's economic recovery will remain hobbled by weaker conditions at home and as lockdown measures taken around the world to contain the COVID-19 crisis, particularly in Europe, weigh.
The government also released data on Friday showing retail sales fell 2.4% in January compared with the same month a year earlier, in a sign households tightened their purse strings as the coronavirus staged a resurgence.
The fall, which was in line with a 2.6% drop seen by economists in a Reuters poll, was largely due to sharp contractions in general merchandise and fabrics apparel spending. It followed a 0.2% fall in December.
Compared to a month earlier, retail sales in January fell 0.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis for the third straight month of declines. But the pace of decline was slower than in the previous two months. 
""We think consumer spending will only fall around 1% quarter-on-quarter this quarter,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.

""We expect it to rise fairly strongly over the coming quarters as the recovery resumes and is soon given a shot in the arm by vaccines,"" he added.

Industrial production rose 4.2% from the previous month, the trade ministry reported Friday. Economists had projected a 3.8% gain amid rising exports, especially to China.
Separate figures showed retail sales fell 0.5% in January from a month earlier and continued falls in consumer prices in Tokyo.
While the drop in retail spending was smaller than during an wider-ranging emergency last year and economists’ forecasts, it still underscored a split in the recovery between domestic and export-driven sectors.

The current account surplus in Latin America's second-biggest economy was $26.6 billion last year, after a deficit of $4.2 billion during 2019, the bank said.
The surplus represented 2.4% of annual gross domestic product (GDP), and the largest since 1983, the bank said.
During the fourth quarter, the surplus was $17.4 billion, equivalent to 5.8% of GDP over the period.
Data published by the bank showed Mexico had posted an annual current account deficit every year since 2006, the latest one for which figures are available in its online data base.

Preliminary figures published last month by the national statistics office showed that Mexico's exports fell by 9.3% last year, while imports tumbled by 15.8%.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 01:50PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market showing tentative signs of improvement; manufacturing strong,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week amid falling COVID-19 infections, but the near-term outlook for the labor market is unclear after winter storms wreaked havoc in the South region in the middle of this month.
Still, the decline in claims to a three-month low reported by the Labor Department on Thursday suggested the labor market was slowly regaining traction, catching up with the broader economy, after hitting a pothole in late 2020. Other data showed a solid increase in demand for U.S.-manufactured goods in January. 
The reports followed on the heels of news last week that retail sales increased by the most in seven months in January.
The brightening economic picture reflects nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government in late December and the reopening of many services businesses as the winter coronavirus wave recedes. It was unlikely to derail President Joe Biden's massive $1.9 trillion recovery plan under consideration in the U.S. Congress.
""The data underscore the big boost to growth already evident from last December's stimulus,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Momentum on the next stimulus bill may be too powerful to stop ... some of the spending is needed despite the economy's strength.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 111,000 to a seasonally adjusted 730,000 for the week ended Feb. 20, the lowest level since November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 838,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims decreased 131,734 to 710,313 last week. There was a sharp decline in filings in Ohio, which had been plagued by fraudulent applications. Claims also fell in California.
Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/oakverynepr/joblessclaims.png
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.2 million people filed claims last week. 
Though claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million last March when the pandemic hit the United States' shores, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, underscoring the damage caused by the virus. 
In the coming week, claims could be boosted by the stormy weather in the densely populated South, which left large parts of Texas in the dark and without water for days. Unadjusted claims for Texas fell last week, likely as power outages prevented the filing and processing of applications.
""We would not be surprised to see a rise in claims next week as a result of the weather-related backup, but expect claims to begin trending lower more definitively over the course of March,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose.
CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM
The economy has recovered 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic. Employment is not expected to return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024. Millions of Americans are experiencing long spells of joblessness.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 101,000 to 4.419 million during the week ended Feb 13. But that was mainly due to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.
At least 5.066 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended Feb. 6, an increase of 1.0 million from the prior period. These benefits, which are funded by the government, will expire in mid-March if Congress does not pass the Biden administration's relief package. 
About 19.043 million people were on unemployment benefits under all programs in early February. But there is reason to be cautiously optimistic about the labor market. 
Daily coronavirus cases and hospitalizations have dropped to levels last seen before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, while the pace of vaccination is picking up. 
The improving public health situation helped to boost retail sales in January. Households perceptions of the labor market also improved in February, setting the wheels in motion for stronger economic growth this quarter. 
A separate report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.5% in January after surging 1.5% in December.
These so-called core capital goods orders jumped 8.3% year-on-year in January, underpinning manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Core capital goods shipments, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, accelerated 2.1% after increasing 1.0% in December.
Graphic: Core capital goods - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdvzeanwpw/corecapgds.png
""While there is still plenty we don't know about activity in the first quarter as a whole, we think that real growth in equipment spending will be strong,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
Economists last week boosted their first-quarter GDP growth estimates to as high as a 6% annualized rate from as low as a 2.3% pace following the blowout retail sales data and indications that the White House's massive stimulus package could be fully approved.

The economy grew at a 4.1% rate last quarter, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth on Thursday. That was a slight upward revision from the 4.0% pace reported in January and a sharp deceleration from a record 33.4% rate in the third quarter.

Orders surged 8.3% year-on-year in January, underpinning manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy.
With many Americans remaining at home, the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted demand to household goods like electronics from services such as airline travel and hotel accommodation. But with more people expected to have access to the coronavirus vaccines by summer, demand for goods is seen slowing.
Still capital expenditure is seen supported by additional relief money from the government to aid the economy's recovery from the pandemic. Business investment on equipment scored double-digit growth in each of the last two quarters.
In January, core capital goods orders were supported by demand for primary and fabricated metal products, as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components. But orders for machinery and computers and electronic products fell.
Shipments of core capital goods accelerated 2.1% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement. They increased 1.0% in December.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, vaulted 3.4% in January after rising 1.2% in December. Durable goods orders were boosted by a 7.8% surge in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.1% gain in December.
Orders for civilian aircraft soared 389.9%. That was despite Boeing (NYSE:BA) reporting on its website that it had received only four aircraft orders in January, down from 90 in December.
The government recently lifted a 20-month grounding of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets that came after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia

Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 0.8% in January after advancing 2.2% in December.

781,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 08:39AM ET</span>",Jobless Claims Fall to Lowest in Nearly 3 Months as Layoff Wave Eases,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The new year wave of layoffs in the U.S. economy appeared to ease off last week, as the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell to its lowest in nearly three months. 
However, there was no clear improvement in the underlying trend, as the total number of people claiming various sorts of unemployment benefits rose by some 700,000 to 19.04 million. The rise was overwhelmingly due to one million more people claiming under the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation scheme.
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 730,000 last week, while the previous week's figure was also revised down by 20,000 to 841,000. Analysts had expected a figure of 838,000 before the release.
The number of continuing claims for benefits, which are reported at a one-week lag to initial claims, fell by 101,000 from an upwardly-revised 4.52 million.
The numbers shed further light on Federal Reserve Jerome Powell's relatively downbeat assessment of the state of the labor market in two days of testimony before Congress this week. Powell had stressed that the U.S. still has 10 million fewer jobs than a year ago, just before the pandemic exploded in the U.S. He noted that the actual rate of unemployment is closer to 10% than the official rate of 6.3%, which takes no account of all those who have dropped out of the workforce over the last year.
""There's a lot of slack in the labor market and a long way to go until we get to full employment,"" Powell told the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. 
Such a high degree of slack in the labor market was seen by analysts as the chief reason for Powell's insistence that the Fed shouldn't tighten its monetary policy, either by raising interest rates or by reducing its monthly bond purchases, any time soon.
Powell's comments have set the tone for financial markets this week, causing the dollar to fall to its lowest in three months. Ten-Year U.S. Treasury yields, however, have risen to their highest in a year. They retraced slightly after the numbers to trade at 1.45%, down one basis point from before the release.
Separately, the Commerce Department said that the surge in demand for durable goods continued into 2021, with a 3.4% rise in January, their biggest jump in five months. 
At the same time, revised data for fourth-quarter economic growth were revised up by 0.1% to 4.1% from an initial estimate of 4.2%."
782,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2021 02:25AM ET</span>",German consumer morale improves more than expected heading into March: GfK,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer morale brightened more than expected heading into March as shoppers in Europe's largest economy became more upbeat that a lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic could be eased soon, a survey showed on Thursday.
The GfK research institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, improved to -12.9 points from a revised -15.5 in February.
The reading marked the first monthly increase since October and beat a Reuters forecast for -14.3.
The infection rate in Germany fell steadily in the first weeks of the year but has stagnated in recent days, and worries over more transmissible variants of the virus persist, making it more difficult for leaders to ease restrictions.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders are expected to meet on March 3 to discuss a gradual easing of lockdown measures that are currently in place until at least March 7.
Restaurants, bars and entertainment venues have been shut since early November. A stricter lockdown from mid-December forced non-essential shops, services and schools to close. Factories and offices have remained open.
GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said consumer morale had somewhat recovered from the shock suffered following the decision to tighten lockdown measures in mid-December.
""The recent dip in infection rates and the launch of the vaccination program are fuelling hopes of a speedy easing of measures,"" Buerkl added.
But a sustained recovery in consumer sentiment will only be on the cards if lockdown measures are really lifted, allowing shops, hotels and restaurants to open again, he said.
If the measures are extended beyond March 7, the chances of a rapid recovery will diminish, and difficult times will continue to lie ahead for consumers, Buerkl said. 
The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.
An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop compared with the same period a year ago.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1% in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""
The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.

The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes increased more than expected in January, boosted by historically low mortgage rates and an acute shortage of previously owned houses on the market.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday suggested the housing market would continue to underpin the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession. Momentum could, however, ebb in the near term after winter storms wreaked havoc this month in Texas and large parts of the South region. 
Higher house prices because of the tight inventory resulting from lack of land and very expensive lumber could push homeownership out of the reach of many first-time buyers. 
""There is an insatiable demand for homes right now, and it can't be met by resales of existing homes, so people are signing contracts for new homes,"" said Holden Lewis, home and mortgage expert at NerdWallet. 
New home sales rose 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 923,000 units last month. December's sales pace was revised higher to 885,000 units from the previously reported 842,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for 12.1% of U.S. home sales, climbing 2.1% to a rate of 855,000 units in January.
Graphic: New home sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xegvbwbbdpq/nhs.png
The median new house price increased 5.3% from a year earlier to $346,400 in January. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. New home sales surged 19.3% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
Sales increased in the South, Midwest and West, but declined in the Northeast. They were concentrated in the $200,000-$749,000 price range. Sales below the $200,000 price bracket, the sought-after segment of the market, accounted for only 6% of transactions last month. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the PHLX housing index outperforming the broader market. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

SUPPLY TIGHT
The National Association of Realtors reported last week that the supply of previously owned homes available for sale plunged to a record low in January. That has pushed buyers toward the market for new homes. Demand for housing is being driven by Americans seeking more space for home offices and schooling as the year-long coronavirus pandemic drags on.
Though mortgage rates have risen in recent weeks in tandem with U.S. Treasury yields as investors anticipate stronger economic growth and higher inflation, the 30-year fixed rate remains well below 3%.
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home decreased 12% last week from a week earlier. Mortgage loan applications were 7% higher compared to the same period last year. 
Economists believed the week-to-week decline in applications reflected disruptions caused by the snow storms, which left large swathes of Texas in the dark and without water supplies.
""We would expect a bounce-back over the next few weeks as activity resumes,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""Housing sector activity should continue to be supportive of GDP growth at least through the first half of 2021.""
Housing and manufacturing have outperformed other sectors of the economy during the pandemic. The government reported last week that building permits soared in January to their highest level since May 2006. But expensive inputs and lack of land pose a threat to continued robust housing market gains. 
According to a survey of single-family homebuilders this month, record-high lumber prices were ""adding thousands of dollars to the cost of a new home and causing some builders to abruptly halt projects."" Softwood lumber prices jumped by historic 73% on a year-on-year basis in January. 
There were 307,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 299,000 in December. At January's sales pace it would take 4.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 4.1 months in December. About 72.4% of homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

""Strong demand, a shortage of supply and rapidly rising prices is the perfect combination of factors that should convince builders that now remains a really good time to get the shovels in the ground,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's record public debt pile rose further above 5 trillion reais in January, while rock-bottom interest rates continued to anchor the cost of servicing it near all-time lows, data showed on Wednesday.
Total federal debt rose 1% in January to 5.06 trillion reais ($932 billion), while the total domestic debt stock rose 1.2% to 4.82 trillion reais, Treasury said.
It said its liquidity cushion, essentially an emergency cash buffer, fell 8.6% in nominal terms from the previous month to 805.7 billion reais. 
""It should be noted that this indicator may change significantly over the coming months, especially those with high volumes of debt maturing,"" Treasury said.
According to Treasury figures, 605 billion reais of domestic federal debt comes due in the first four months of this year, with 283 billion needing to be rolled over in April alone, the most ever for a single month.
February has seen a recovery in global markets and improving risk sentiment toward emerging countries. But growing concerns about Brazil's fiscal trajectory and reform agenda continue to sour sentiment toward it and push up longer-term rates, it added.
The average rate of interest on the domestic federal debt stock fell to a new low of 7.15% from 7.3%, but the average rate on new domestic debt issued in the 12 months to January inched up to 4.65% from a record low of 4.44%.
Treasury said that the average maturity on the domestic debt stock in January edged up to 3.41 years from a record low 3.39 in December, and the average on the overall federal debt stock rose to 3.61 years from 3.59.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's current account deficit in the year to January as a share of the overall economy shrank to its smallest in 13 years, official figures showed on Wednesday, thanks mainly to a decline in the primary income and services deficits in the month.
The current account deficit of 0.65% of gross domestic product in the 12 months to January was down from 0.87% the previous month and the smallest since February, 2008, central bank figures showed. 
Graphic: Brazil current account % of GDP - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmyvmwqxkvr/CADEF.png
A combination of an exchange rate depreciation of more than 30% in the year to January and a shrinking trade deficit driven largely by a steep fall in imports over the last year has helped deliver Brazil's more favorable balance of payments position.
Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Washington-based Institute for International Finance, says the real at current levels of around 5.40 per dollar is undervalued, and the ""modest"" current account deficit and ""solid"" capital inflows point to fair value around 4.50 per dollar.
Brazil's current account deficit in the month of January was $7.25 billion, the second deficit in a row and slightly less than the $7.75 billion shortfall forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
It was significantly smaller than the $10.3 billion deficit from the same month last year, as the trade deficit shrank to $1.9 billion from $2.5 billion. The services deficit shrank almost 60% to $1.0 billion, the smallest in 12 years.
Foreign direct investment in January totaled $1.8 billion, the central bank said, less than the $2.8 billion forecast in a Reuters poll.
Based on partial data so far for February, the central bank expects FDI to total $6.5 billion this month and a current account deficit of $2.3 billion this month.

Net portfolio investments into Brazil totaled $6.2 billion in January, the eighth consecutive month of inflows, the central bank said. Of that, $4.7 billion went into stocks, and $1.5 billion in debt securities.

Mexican annual inflation ticked up to 3.84% from a rate of 3.74% in the second half of January, but undershot the consensus forecast of a Reuters poll for a reading of 3.88%.
A breakdown of the data published by the agency known as INEGI showed that fuels and certain fruits and vegetables helped to push up prices in early February.
The Mexican central bank, which targets a rate of 3%, earlier this month cut its benchmark lending rate for the first time since September, flagging uncertainty over the economic outlook and global efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

Compared with the previous two-week period, prices rose by 0.23% in the first half of February. Meanwhile, core prices, which strip out some volatile elements, rose 0.22%. The core annual inflation rate also advanced to 3.84%.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer confidence in Brazil rose in February for the first time in five months, a survey indicated on Wednesday, lifted by the start of a nationwide vaccination program against COVID-19 and prospects of the government resuming emergency income transfers to the poor.
The rise was most pronounced among consumers in the lowest income bracket, although the overall level of confidence was still below that registered at the end of last year, the Getulio Vargas Foundation's (FGV) findings showed.
""The start of the immunization campaign against COVID-19 and the possibility of extending emergency aid seem to have reduced consumer gloom in February,"" said FGV research manager Viviane Seda Bittencourt.
""Confidence levels, however, remain low and sustaining an upward trend will depend on factors such as the speed of vaccination, the evolution of the pandemic and, mainly, the recovery of the labor market,"" she said.
FGV's consumer confidence index rose 2.2 points to 78.0 points in February. That was still below December's 78.5.
Confidence among those in the lowest income bracket earning up to 2,100 reais ($385) a month, who will benefit from the renewed cash transfer program likely to be rolled out soon, rose 5.8 points to 75.3. 
Current expectations and the outlook for the coming months improved, although both remained below December's levels, FGV said.

""Above all, industry has come through the winter robustly so far,"" said DIW forecaster Claus Michelsen.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Strong exports and solid construction activity helped the German economy to grow by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the final quarter of last year, but stricter lockdown measures at home and abroad are clouding the outlook for Europe's largest economy.
The data, published by the Federal Statistics Office on Wednesday, marked an upward revision to its earlier estimate for a 0.1% expansion over the previous quarter.
The office also revised upward its 2020 full-year GDP figure to -4.9% from -5.0%.
Adjusted for calendar effects, the German economy shrank by 5.3% last year, a much smaller contraction than in many other European countries, helped by a strong fiscal response to the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
A debt-financed fiscal splurge created an overall state budget deficit of 139.6 billion euros or 4.2% of gross domestic product in 2020, the office said. This was the first deficit since 2011 and the second-highest since German reunification.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the growth data sent a positive signal, adding: ""We will continue to do everything we can in the coming months to maintain the substance of our economy.""
Germany had registered record growth of 8.5% in the third quarter and an unprecedented plunge of 9.7% in the second, due to the effects of its first coronavirus lockdown.
The second lockdown, imposed at the beginning of November in hospitality venues and expanded in mid-December to include most shops and services, caused a plunge in household spending in the fourth quarter, the office said.
DEMAND FROM CHINA
Disposable income rose slightly, however, thanks to job protection schemes and state aid for parents. As the lockdown prevented many consumers from spending, the savings rate was an unusually high 15.7%.
Household spending fell 3.3% in the quarter and construction spending rose 1.8%. Exports grew 4.5%.
This meant net trade contributed 0.6 percentage points to the overall growth rate, whereas sluggish domestic activity subtracted 0.3 percentage points, the office said.
Thomas Gitzel from VP Bank said export-oriented manufacturers benefited from growing orders from China while low interest rates helped the construction industry.
But the outlook remains clouded as German authorities have extended the stricter lockdown until at least March 7, while restrictions in other countries are weakening demand from abroad.
""Going forward, we stick to our forecast of a 1.5% q/q decline in the first quarter of 2021, mainly due to the negative effects on overall economic activity from the extended and tightened lockdown,"" UniCredit said in a research note.
Carsten Brzeski from ING said that stricter lockdown measures since mid-December, weaker demand from other euro zone countries, harsh winter weather in February and a reversal of pre-Brexit hoarding in the UK had increased the downside risk for the first quarter of 2021.

""The growth drivers of the fourth quarter could easily become drags in the first,"" Brzeski cautioned.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence increased in February, with households slightly more upbeat about the labor market amid declining new COVID-19 infections and expectations for additional money from the government to help the economy's recovery from the pandemic. 
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday also showed consumers warming up to overseas vacations, though fewer intended to purchase homes, automobiles and other big-ticket items over the next six months. Consumers anticipated higher inflation as well. This fits in with economists' predictions that demand will swing back to services from goods by summer as more Americans get vaccinated, and boost price pressures.
There are concerns in some quarters that very accommodative fiscal and monetary policy will ignite inflation this year. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has played down these fears, citing three decades of lower and stable inflation. 
On Tuesday, Powell told lawmakers that the U.S. central bank would keep interest rates low and continue to pump money into the economy through bond purchases ""at least at the current pace until we make substantial further progress towards our goals ... which we have not really been making.""
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index rose to a reading of 91.3 this month from 88.9 in January. Confidence remains well below its lofty reading of 132.6 last February.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index nudging up to a reading of 90. The cut-off date for the survey was Feb. 11 and did not fully capture the winter storm, which knocked out electric power in Texas, or the easing of dining restrictions in New York city.
""With additional fiscal relief coming and better progress on the vaccination front, sentiment should rise further,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""As we approach herd immunity, pent-up demand will be released.""
COVID-19 cases in the United States have declined for the sixth consecutive week, with daily cases and hospitalizations falling to the lowest level since before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. The pace of vaccination is also picking up.
Health experts have warned, however, that coronavirus variants initially discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil could unleash another wave that threatens to reverse the recent positive trends. The virus has claimed more than 500,000 lives in the U.S. just over a year since the pandemic hit the nation. President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan from the pandemic is gaining traction in the U.S. Congress.

CAUTION LINGERS
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, rebounded to a reading of 92.0 after declining for three straight months, indicating a pick-up in economic growth was underway. Retail sales surged in January, prompting economists to boost their first-quarter growth estimates to as high as a 6% annualized rate from as low as a 2.3% pace.
Still, consumers remain cautious. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions slipped to 90.8 from a reading of 91.2 in January.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, rose to a reading of 0.7 this month from -2.5 in January. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report and raised hopes for steady job growth this month.
The economy created only 49,000 jobs in January after shedding 227,000 jobs in December, the first decline in payrolls in eight months. About 12.3 million jobs of the 22.2 million lost during the pandemic have been recovered. 
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income dipped to 15.2% from 15.8% last month. The proportion anticipating a drop fell to 13.2% from 15.5% in January.
There was an uptick in the share of consumers planning to go on vacation over the next six months, but mostly overseas. Fewer consumers expected to purchase homes, motor vehicles and major household appliances. Consumers' inflation expectations over the next 12 months shot up to 6.3% from 6% in January.
""We believe the change in expectations reflects a real sense that consumers are facing higher inflation rates than appear to be being captured in the CPI,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
The moderation in house-buying intentions likely points to a slowdown in sales, which have been powered by demand for more spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. Higher prices amid tight supply could also slow home sales. 
A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index soared 10.1% in December from a year ago, the largest gain since April 2014, after increasing 9.2% in November.

Robust house price inflation was confirmed by a third report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index jumped 11.4% year-on-year in December after rising 11.1% in November. Prices accelerated 10.8% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, double the 5.4% logged in the same period in 2019.

The unemployment rate was 1.86% in the October-December quarter, representing 730,000 workers without jobs, agency data showed, down from 1.90% in the September quarter. The rate hit an 11-year high of 1.95% in the June quarter.
""Employment increased slightly, while the unemployment rate remained high and working hours were still lower than pre-crisis levels,"" Danucha Pichayanan, head of the National Economic and Social Development Council, told a briefing.
The number of workers in Thailand's economy rose to 38.3 million in the fourth quarter of last year from 37.9 million in the previous quarter and from 37.5 million in the final quarter of 2019.
The increase took place mainly in farming, which benefited from higher crop prices and government projects.
But the jobless rate jumped to 1.69% last year, the highest level in at least 16 years, from 0.98% in 2019, as Southeast Asia's second-largest economy suffered its worst contraction in over two decades in 2020 as tourism slumped.
After managing to get its first coronavirus outbreak under control within a few months last year, Thailand is now dealing with a second wave that has slowed economic activity.
The latest coronavirus wave would hit businesses that had not yet recovered from the first outbreak, risking job cuts, Danucha said.
""If the virus cannot be controlled, combined with delays in the distribution of vaccines, the impact on the labour market and employment will be severe in the long run,"" he said.

Thailand will start vaccinating priority groups, including health workers, against COVID-19 later this week, with the country's first coronavirus vaccines due to arrive on Wednesday.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat confirmed earlier estimates that consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.2% month-on-month for a 0.9% year-on-year increase, as expected by economists.
Volatile energy prices were 3.8% higher on the month but still 4.2% lower than a year earlier and unprocessed food was 1.2% more expensive on the month and 2.0% year-on-year.
Without these two volatile components, consumer prices fell 0.3% against December and were 1.4% higher than in January 2020.
An even narrower measure excluding also alcohol and tobacco prices, that often change because of excise tax changes, fell 0.5% month-on-month in January and rose 1.4% in annual terms.
Eurostat said services, which make up two thirds of the euro zone economy, added 0.65 percentage points to the final annual inflation result and non-energy industrial goods added another 0.37 point, offsetting a 0.41 point subtraction from cheap energy.
Food, alcohol and tobacco added 0.3 point, Eurostat said.

The January rebound brings inflation, which has been negative for months, a bit closer to the European Central Bank's target of below, but close to 2% over the medium term.

Statistics South Africa said the unemployment rate stood at 32.5% in the October-December quarter, meaning 7.2 million people were unemployed, up from 30.8% in the previous three months.
The figure was the highest since the survey began in 2008.
""We are seeing that the proportion of people of working age, versus the proportion of those that are employed, is widening, meaning the market is not creating sufficient jobs to absorb enough (people),"" Statistician General Risenga Maluleke told a news conference.
South Africa, which has the continent's highest rate of COVID-19 infections, was in recession before it recorded its first coronavirus infection in March and has long suffered from extremely high levels of unemployment.
According to an expanded definition of unemployment that includes those discouraged from seeking work, 42.6% of the labour force was without work in the fourth quarter, amounting to 11.1 million people, Stats SA data showed.

Compared to a year ago, total employment fell by 1.4 million people, while the number of people who were not economically active rose by 1.5 million, the agency said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's jobless rate rose to 5.1% in the last three months of 2020, its highest in nearly five years but still lower than it would have been without a huge coronavirus jobs support scheme that finance minister Rishi Sunak looks set to extend next week.
Separate data from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of employees on company payrolls in January rose by 83,000 from December, the second monthly increase and its biggest since January 2015.
The jobless rate - the highest since the first three months of 2016 - was in line with the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
Unemployment has been suppressed by the government's Job Retention Scheme which is supporting about one in five employees. 
The programme is Britain's most expensive COVID economic support measure and will cost an estimated 70 billion pounds ($98 billion) by its scheduled expiry date of April 30.
But figures based on tax data show the number of employees on business payrolls has still fallen by 726,000 since February 2020 - equivalent to just over 2% of the workforce - with the majority of job losses suffered by workers aged under 25.
The Bank of England has said it thinks the unemployment rate will jump to almost 8% in mid-2021 after the furlough scheme ends.
Sunak is expected to announce an extension of his jobs support, at least for sectors hardest hit by the government's lockdowns, in a March 3 budget statement.
""At the Budget next week I will set out the next stage of our Plan for Jobs, and the support we’ll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery,"" Sunak said after Tuesday's data.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his plan for easing England's lockdown on Monday that would keep some businesses shut until the summer but allow a gradual, earlier reopening for others.
""The outlook for the UK economy is getting clearer and with continued support from the Treasury, it is likely the Bank of England's peak unemployment forecast of 7.75% will prove too pessimistic,"" Jon Hudson (NYSE:HUD), a fund manager at Premier Miton, said.
Samuel Tombs, at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he thought the jobless rate would hit 6% in the summer.
The ONS said the number of job vacancies in the three months to January was 26% lower than a year ago, a less severe fall than last summer when vacancies were down by nearly 60%, although the pace of improvement slowed in the past few months.
Pay growth was the strongest since 2008. Total pay including bonuses rose by 4.7% in the October-December period compared with the same three months of 2019.
The pick-up in pay growth in part reflects how the brunt of job losses has fallen on people working in lower-paid jobs in areas such as hospitality, and the ONS said pay growth was likely to be below 3% if this effect is stripped out. 
Britain went into a new COVID lockdown on Jan. 5 due to a rapidly rising death toll that has passed 120,000, the highest in Europe.

Average new home prices in 70 major cities increased 0.3% in January from a month earlier, the fastest growth since September, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics. That compared with an uptick of 0.1% in December.
On a year-on-year basis, new home prices rose 3.9%, quickening from a 3.8% gain in December.
As China's economy rebounds from the COVID-19 shock, authorities have stepped up curbs on the property sector to safeguard against financial risks as concerns grow of a speculative bubble in some parts of the market.
The NBS data showed 53 cities reported monthly growth, with the number rising from 42 in December.
The relentless upward price pressure was again mainly driven by bigger cities. New home prices growth in tier-1 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, quickened 0.6% from the previous month, while second-hand home prices posted a sharper gain of 1.3%, with growth in both sectors outpacing lower-tier cities. 
The price uptick at the beginning of the year can be mainly attributed to the record volume of credit issued in January, said Zhang Dawei, an analyst with property agency Centaline.
""The flows of business loans, which enjoy a huge interest rate spread with the normal mortgages, into the property sector, have particularly fuelled the upward pressure in top-tier cities.""
Central bank data showed China's new bank loans leapt to new highs in January boosted by seasonal demand, with household loans, mostly mortgages, more than double the level seen in December.
China's property market recovered quickly from the COVID-19 crisis last year, mostly in bigger cities. But the rebound has raised concerns about financial risks and policymakers have since then tightened screws on the funnelling of funds into the sector.
Last month saw major cities including Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing unveiling tighter regulations to close loopholes in home transactions and contain illegal flows of funds into the sector. These steps came on top of a slew of measures it took last year.
Mortgage rates have also climbed recently.

""We should stay alert to the resurgence of house price rises or market speculation, especially if the coronavirus epidemic is effectively controlled and the economy stages a solid rebound,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale rose far more than expected in February, bouncing back from a 6-month low in January thanks to a brighter industrial outlook and well-stocked order books, the Ifo economic institute said on Monday.
Ifo said its business climate index increased to 92.4 from an upwardly revised 90.3 in January, hitting its highest level since October and surpassing even the strongest forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""The German economy is looking towards recovery again,"" Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters.
Germany, once a role model for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, has struggled with the second wave. A month ago this still weighed heavily on sentiment.
But Wohlrabe said companies have now revised up production plans significantly and export expectations for industry have also risen.
""The order books are well filled,"" he added.
An Ifo expectations index surged to 94.2 from 91.5 in January, surpassing all forecasts in the Reuters poll. A current conditions index edged up to 90.6 from 89.2.
""Companies are sniffing the spring air and starting to look beyond the pandemic,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Joerg Kraemer.
Kraemer expected a strong recovery from spring onwards, ""especially as consumers' corona(virus) savings amount to six percent of their annual disposable income at the end of 2020.""
The main risk to this scenario was a third wave of coronavirus infections and a blanket lockdown extension to end-April, to which he gave a 25% probability.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state premiers have agreed to extend restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus until March 7. She told a party meeting that she wants a staggered plan to lift restrictions, according to two participants.
The number of new daily infections has stagnated over the past week with the seven-day incidence rate hovering at around 60 cases per 100,000. On Monday, Germany reported 4,369 new infections and 62 further deaths.
Other sentiment indicators have also been promising.
Investor morale in Germany surged in February on expectations consumption will take off in the coming months, the ZEW economic research institute said last Tuesday.
Earlier this month, industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) raised its full-year outlook for the first time in nearly four years, and CEO Martina Merz said ""we're noticing signs of an economic recovery"".

The government last month slashed its GDP growth forecast to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%. This means the economy probably will probably not reach its pre-pandemic level before mid-2022.

The Fundacao Getulio Vargas's national industrial confidence index for February fell 3.1 points to a seasonally adjusted 108,1 from 111.3 in January, according to a preliminary reading.
That is the lowest since September, but is still high by historical standards. December was the highest level of confidence in over a decade.
Graphic: Brazil industrial confidence - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbwlrlvq/industrialconf.png
But the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and two months since the end of the government's emergency cash transfer program during which millions of people have seen their incomes collapse, have put the economy under huge strain.
""The fall in industrial confidence is driven by the decrease in satisfaction with current conditions, but mainly due to the worsening of expectations regarding the next few months,"" FGV said in a press release.
The current conditions index fell 0.9 points to 115.4, while the expectations index fell 5.3 points to 101.0.

Capacity utilization fell 0.8 percentage points to 79.1%, the lowest since September, it added. January's 79.9% was the highest in over six years.

The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said 56% of businesses planned to increase staff numbers in the coming months, up from 53% in late 2020 but below the 66% planning to hire staff a year ago before the pandemic.
The proportion of firms planning redundancies dropped sharply to 20% from 30% in the last quarter.
However the CIPD said unemployment was likely to rise sharply if finance minister Rishi Sunak does not extend jobs support for businesses at his March 3 budget.
""It is far too soon to rule out further significant private sector redundancies later in the year if the government does not extend the furlough scheme to the end of June or if the economy suffers any additional unexpected shocks,"" said Gerwyn Davies, a senior labour market advisor to the CIPD.
A costly furlough programme that is supporting around one in five private-sector employees during the current lockdown is due to end on April 30.
The British Chambers of Commerce warned last week that one in four of its members planned to make job cuts if the support ended while they were still feeling the impact of the pandemic.
The CIPD said hiring plans were strongest in healthcare, finance, education and IT, and weakest in the hospitality sector which is bearing the brunt of the current lockdown.

The survey, run jointly with recruiters  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN), covered 2,000 employers between Jan. 5 and Jan. 30.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity cools; cost pressures mounting,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity slowed in early February likely as a global semiconductor chip shortage hurt production at automobile plants, while prices of inputs and manufactured goods soared, which could heighten fears of strong inflation growth this year.
The report from data firm IHS Markit on Friday also showed businesses in the services industry were experiencing higher costs related to the procurement of personal protective equipment, a greater proportion of which they were passing on to clients ""through a marked rise in selling prices.""
Inflation is being closely watched amid concerns from some quarters that President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 rescue package could cause the economy to overheat. The package would be on top of nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus provided at the end of December.
""A concern is that firms' costs have surged higher, driving selling prices for goods and services up at a survey record pace and hinting at a further increase in inflation,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
IHS Markit's flash U.S. manufacturing PMI dropped to 58.5 in the first half of this month from a final reading of 59.2 in January. Extreme weather in large parts of the United States was also blamed. The data was in line with economists' forecasts. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing has powered ahead as the pandemic left Americans grounded at home, shifting demand to household goods from services like airline travel and hotel accommodation.
But the coronavirus has disrupted labor at both suppliers and manufacturers, leading to shortages of goods critical to the production processes. Motor vehicle manufacturers have been hit by a semiconductor chip shortage, leading some to temporarily close assembly plants this month.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced it would take down production entirely at its Fairfax plant in Kansas City during the week of Feb. 8. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) has reduced shifts at its Dearborn truck plant and Kansas City assembly plant. 
The supply chain bottlenecks, which are widespread across the manufacturing sector as well as the services industry, have led to higher prices for inputs, including raw materials. The survey's measure of prices paid by manufacturers shot up to its highest level since April 2011. A gauge of prices received by factories surged to its highest level since July 2008.
Though price pressures are expected to rise as last year's low readings drop out of the calculation, there is no consensus among economists whether higher inflation would stick beyond the so-called base effects. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week while he expected inflation to be boosted by base effects and pent-up demand when the economy fully reopens, that would be transitory, citing three decades of lower and stable prices. 
The inflation outlook will likely hinge on the labor market, which is currently experiencing considerable slack, with at least 18.3 million Americans on unemployment benefits.
While the manufacturing expansion cooled, activity in the services industry gained traction this month. 
The IHS Markit's flash services sector PMI edged up to 58.9 from a final reading of 58.3 in January. The highest reading since March 2015 came as new COVID-19 infections and hospitalization rates dropped, allowing authorities to roll back some restrictions on consumer-facing businesses. 
The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has borne the brunt of the pandemic.
Cost burdens for services businesses increased at their steepest pace since October 2009, leading to firms boosting their selling prices at the sharpest rate on record.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

STRONG HOUSING MARKET
Manufacturing and housing are leading the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession. In a separate report on Friday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales rose 0.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million units in January. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall 1.5% to a rate of 6.61 million units in January. The second straight monthly increase in sales was despite contracts to buy a home declining for four consecutive months. The NAR attributed the misalignment to different sample sizes. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 23.7% on a year-on-year basis. The gains have defied tight supply, which has led to a surge in house price inflation. Sales last month were concentrated in the mid-to-upper price range of the market. Sales fell in the Northeast and West. They, however, rose in the South and the Midwest.
""Existing home sales will remain strong but will be unable to move significantly higher until more supply appears,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. 
Graphic: Existing home sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yzdpxwandvx/ehs.png

The housing market is being driven by still historically low mortgage rates, and demand for spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. 
There were a record-low 1.04 million previously owned homes on the market in January, down 25.7% from one year ago. The median existing house price shot up 14.1% from a year ago to $303,900 in January. 
At January's sales pace, it would take 1.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.1 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The business confidence index fell 0.12% to 48.7% in January, the government's DANE statistics agency said.
Colombia's biggest cities declared neighborhood lockdowns during the last days of December and the start of January, as well as curfews and restrictions on movement to contain a second wave of the pandemic.
Business owners' outlook on whether things would improve for companies and the country over the next 12 months deteriorated last month, according to DANE. 
""This may be an indirect sign that effectively targeted closures, specific measures to restrict consumer access to goods and commerce due to the epidemiological situations that we saw in January are presenting cause for concern,"" said DANE director Juan Daniel Oviedo.
Some 46.9% of business owners reported declining demand for their goods and services, as well as supply-side problems, Oviedo said. 
Latin America's fourth-largest economy contracted a historic 6.8% last year.

While both analysts and authorities expect economic recovery this year, Colombia's central bank lowered its GDP growth projections for 2021 to a range of between 2% and 6%, with 4.5% as the most likely figure, from a previous projection of between 3% and 7%, due to the quarantines of the first month.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall 1.5% to a rate of 6.61 million units in January. 
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 23.7% on a year-on-year basis.
The housing market, the economy's star performer during the COVID-19 recession, is being supported by historically low mortgage rates and demand for spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling, mostly in the suburbs and other lower-density areas. 
But demand has far outstripped supply, driving up home prices. About 23.2% of the labor force is working from home. 
Last month, sales fell in the Northeast and West. They, however, rose in the South and the Midwest. 
There were a record-low 1.04 million previously owned homes on the market in January, down 25.7% from one year ago. The median existing house price shot up 14.1% from a year ago to $303,900 in January. 
The inventory crunch could ease as builders step up construction, though they are facing challenges from record lumber prices as well as shortages of land and labor. 
The government reported on Thursday that permits for future home building soared in January to their highest level since May 2006.

At January's sales pace, it would take 1.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.1 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales tumbled in January as shops went back into lockdown, official data showed, but lower-than-expected public borrowing gave at least some relief to finance minister Rishi Sunak as he prepares his next round of emergency spending.
A separate survey suggested the economy barely shrank in February as companies adjusted to the new restrictions and firms were very upbeat about the prospects for a rebound thanks to the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations.
The data for January showed retail sales volumes slumped by 8.2% from December, a far bigger fall than the 2.5% decrease forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the second largest on record. 
""The only good thing about the current lockdown is that it's no way near as bad for the economy as the first one,"" Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
The smaller fall in retail sales than last April's 18% plunge reflected the growth in online shopping.
The Office for National Statistics said public sector borrowing of 8.8 billion pounds ($12.3 billion) was the first January deficit in a decade, but the deficit was a lot less than a forecast of 24.5 billion pounds in the Reuters poll.
That took borrowing since the start of the financial year in April to 270.6 billion pounds, reflecting the surge in spending and tax cuts ordered by Sunak.
That figure does not yet include losses on government-backed loans which are likely to add 30 billion pounds to the shortfall this year, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank. 
Sunak is expected to extend the government's wage subsidies, at least for the hardest-hit sectors, in his budget statement on March 3, but he said on Friday the time would come for a reckoning.
""It's right that once our economy begins to recover, we should look to return the public finances to a more sustainable footing and I'll always be honest with the British people about how we will do this,"" he said.
Some economists see higher taxes sooner rather than later.
""Big tax rises eventually will have to be announced, with 2022 likely to be the worst year, so that they will be far from voters' minds by the time of the next general election in May 2024,"" Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.
Public debt rose to 2.115 trillion pounds or 97.9% of gross domestic product, a share not seen since the early 1960s. 
BOUNCE-BACK AHEAD?
Britain's economy - which had its biggest slump in 300 years in 2020 when it contracted by 10% - will shrink by 4% in the first three months of 2021 before recovering thanks to the fast COVID-19 vaccination programme, the Bank of England says.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will lift the lockdown in England only gradually.
But a survey by market research firm GfK showed consumers were the most confident since the pandemic struck. 
""The hope, and our expectation, is that when the lockdown is finally lifted, we will see a surge in consumer spending, rather than a more permanent scarring of the consumer confidence,"" James Sproule, an economist at Handelsbanken, said. 
Another survey, the IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index suggested activity stabilised this month after a big fall in January.
""Although the data hint at a renewed contraction of the economy in the first quarter, business expectations for the year ahead improved to the highest for almost seven years, suggesting the economy is poised for recovery,"" IHS Markit's chief business economist, Chris Williamson, said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business activity across the euro zone contracted again in February as lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus hammered the bloc's dominant service industry, a survey showed, even as factories had their busiest month in three years.
With daily reported infections still high governments have been encouraging citizens to stay home and closed much of the continent's hospitality industry while factories have largely remained open.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, nudged closer to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, registering 48.1 in February compared to January's 47.8. A Reuters poll had predicted 48.0.
However, some of that activity was from completing old orders. The backlogs of work index fell to 47.9 from 49.0.
""Ongoing COVID-19 lockdown measures dealt a further blow to the euro zone's service sector in February, adding to the likelihood of GDP falling again in the first quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
The euro zone economy is in a double-dip recession, according to last week's Reuters poll of economists, who said the risks to their already weak outlook was skewed more to the downside. [ECILT/EU]
A PMI covering the services industry fell to 44.7 from January's 45.4, well below the median expectation in a Reuters poll for 45.9.
But with vaccination programmes accelerating, driving hopes for a return to some form of normality, optimism about the year ahead improved sharply. The services business expectations index climbed to its highest since April 2018.
""Assuming vaccine roll-outs can boost service sector growth alongside a sustained strong manufacturing sector, the second half of the year should see a robust recovery take hold,"" Williamson said.
Strong demand for manufactured goods helped the factory PMI soar to 57.7 from 54.8, the highest since February 2018 and well above all forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted 54.3. An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, jumped to 57.5 from 54.6.

IHS Markit's flash purchasing managers' index (PMI) of activity in the manufacturing sector shot up to 60.6 from 57.1 in January, beating a forecast for fall to 56.5. 
Reflecting differing fortunes in Europe's biggest economy, activity in the services sector slowed to a nine-month low of 45.9 from 46.7 in January. This was below both the 50 mark separating growth from contraction and a forecast reading of 46.5.
As a result, the flash composite PMI, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the German economy, rose to a two-month high of 51.3 from 50.8 the previous month.
Germany went into lockdown in November and restrictions were tightened in mid-December to stem the coronavirus. Most of the measures that shut all non-essential businesses have been extended until March 7 as more contagious variants of the virus led to border controls being imposed with the Czech Republic and Austria.
""Ongoing weakness in services, where large parts of the sector remain either closed or disrupted by virus containment measures, continues to be counterbalanced by strong, export-driven growth across manufacturing,"" said Phil Smith, Associate Director at IHS Markit.
He added that the survey had showed record reports of delivery delays and sharply rising input prices, pointing to increasing supply-side pressures.

""Looking further down the line, businesses are growing in confidence about the outlook for activity in the year ahead, with the vaccine roll-out hoped to bring an end to restrictions later in the year and help release pent-up demand,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices marked the sixth straight month of annual declines in January but the pace of falls slowed, offering some relief for policymakers worried about deflationary pressures the economy face from the coronavirus pandemic.
Still, soft domestic demand means the Bank of Japan's priority will be to avert a return to deflation, unlike other countries such as the United States where inflation has recently perked up.
Core consumer prices, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food costs, fell 0.6% in January from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, compared with a median market forecast for a 0.7% drop.
The decline was smaller than a 1.0% drop in December, partly due to the termination of the government's ""Go To"" discount campaign for domestic travel and a recent rebound in fuel costs.
Durable goods prices rose on strong demand from stay-home policies to prevent the spread of the pandemic, with prices of air conditioners rising 7.2% and those for microwave ovens up 12.2%, the data showed.
The so-called ""core-core"" CPI, which strips away the impact of both energy and fresh food costs, rose 0.1% from a year earlier after three straight months of declines.
""Looking past a potential renewed drag once the Go To campaigns resume ... inflation should recover into positive territory over the coming months as energy prices rebound and underlying price pressures return in line with the economic recovery,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
Japan's economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, extending the recovery from its worst postwar recession thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that boosted exports and capital spending.

But new state of emergency curbs rolled out in January cloud the outlook, underscoring the challenge policymakers face in preventing the spread of COVID-19 without choking off a fragile recovery.

807,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 08:09PM ET</span>",Australian Retail Sales Rise at Slower Pace as Lockdown Drags,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian household spending rose at a slower-than-expected pace in January as a short, sharp Covid-19 lockdown in the northeastern state of Queensland dragged on stronger performances in other parts of the country.
Preliminary retail sales advanced 0.6% from December, but came in below economists’ median estimate of a 2% gain, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in a report released in Sydney Friday. Queensland dropped 1.5% last month, while New South Wales advanced 1%.
“There continues to be variations in retail sales between states and territories, as Covid-19 restrictions are tightened or eased,” said Ben James, an official at the ABS. “All states and territories rose in January, except Queensland, where a three-day lockdown impacted trade. NSW led the rises, as restrictions that began in December were eased during January.”
Australians are cashed up from government stimulus and fewer spending options during the Covid-19 lockdown. That’s been reinforced by the central bank slashing its key interest rate to 0.10% and initiating bond-buying programs that have helped lower borrowing costs across the economy.
Authorities’ success in suppressing Covid-19 -- outside occasional flare-ups -- has resulted in a rapid rebound in household and business sentiment, boosting activity and hiring. Unemployment has fallen from a pandemic peak of 7.5% to 6.4% in January as fiscal and monetary stimulus supported the economy through the worst of Covid-19, and is now fueling a recovery.
Australia’s household savings ratio stood at an elevated 18.9% at the end of September last year, having reached a record 22.1% in mid-2020.
Today’s data showed food retailing led the gains, as supermarkets recovered from a fall in December. There were declines in clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing, household goods and department stores, which all saw impacts from interrupted trade in Queensland, the ABS said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week, raising the possibility of a second straight month of tepid job growth despite declining new COVID-19 infections.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, could add impetus to President Joe Biden's push for a $1.9 trillion package to aid the recovery from the pandemic. 
At least 18.3 million Americans were receiving unemployment checks at the end of January. Government-funded benefits for millions of these people will expire in mid-March unless Congress approves the Biden administration's spending plan.
""Robust pandemic aid is precisely the medicine the economy needs to get Americans back where they want to be, at work,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 861,000 for the week ended Feb. 13. Data for the prior week was revised to show 55,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
There were big jumps in filings in California and Illinois, while claims in Ohio remained elevated. 
Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qmyvmwbbavr/joblessclaims.png
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 765,000 applications in the latest week. Many were perplexed by the second straight weekly increase in claims, given the declining coronavirus cases, the disbursement of nearly $900 billion in additional rescue aid by the government in late December and the White House's pending massive stimulus package.
Timely data have shown an improvement in economic activity, with retail sales surging by the most in seven months in January. A Conference Board survey on Thursday showed only 12% of chief executive officers in the first quarter anticipated reducing their workforce over the next 12 months, down from 34% in the prior period. 
""Although the economy in the first quarter appears to be rebounding more strongly than expected, the same does not appear to be true of the labor market at this point,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
PLANT CLOSURES
Some of the increase in claims could be related to the temporary closure of automobile plants beginning last week due to a global semiconductor chip shortage. General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced it would take down production entirely at its Fairfax plant in Kansas City during the week of Feb. 8. 
Claims could remain higher after a winter storm walloped Texas and parts of the South this week. 
Filings for a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs jumped 174,427 to 516,299 last week, which economists blamed on fraud in Ohio. Including this program, 1.4 million people filed claims last week.
Claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession, though they are below the record 6.867 million reported last March when the pandemic hit the United States.
Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm portion of February's employment report. Though claims have not provided a good signal on job growth because of the shock caused by the pandemic, the continued increase in filings is consistent with weak labor market conditions.
""The claims data are consistent with the downbeat message from labor market indicators at the start of the year,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""While downside risks remain, broader vaccine distribution and increased fiscal support should lead to a marked improvement in labor market trends by the spring and summer.""
The economy created 49,000 jobs in January after shedding 227,000 in December, the first drop in payrolls in eight months.
About 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated employment would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024. 
Labor market sluggishness is likely to prevent an anticipated acceleration in inflation this year from becoming troublesome. A second report from the Labor Department showed import prices increased by the most in nearly nine years in January, lifted by higher prices for energy products and a weak dollar.

But the economy is steadily improving, with the housing market and manufacturing the main pillars of support. 
In a third report, the Commerce Department said permits for future home construction soared 10.4% to a rate of 1.881 million units in January, the highest level since May 2006. 
The housing market has outperformed other sectors of the economy during the pandemic, supported by lower mortgages rates and demand for spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling.
""Strength in forward-looking building permits reaffirm that housing sector activity can remain strong into 2021, with new construction, in particular, becoming an engine for growth in the coming months,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. 
A fourth report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its business conditions index slipped to a still solid reading of 23.1 this month from 26.5 in January amid a decline in new orders and shipments. But factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware boosted employment and increased hours for workers.

The Conference Board's ""Measure of CEO Confidence"" showed chief executives were the most confident they had been since 2004. 
It also indicated that 36% of CEOs planned pay increases for their employees of more than 3% in the next 12 months, up from 22% in the previous survey in September. And just 12% expect to cut jobs in the next year, down from 34% previously.
The survey, conducted between Jan. 14 and Jan. 29, also found that 45% of CEOs expect to increase capital spending, up from 25% in September, and 47% plan to expand their workforce, up from 33%.
The report may foreshadow a long-hoped-for improvement in a U.S. labor market that is still deeply scarred by the pandemic and its disruptions to businesses and everyday life.

A Labor Department report released on Thursday showed first-time filings for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week and that as of the end of January, more than 18 million people without work were still receiving some kind of government jobless benefit.

The Labor Department said on Thursday import prices jumped 1.4% last month, the biggest gain since March 2012, after increasing 1.0% in December. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, gaining 1.0% in January. In the 12 months through January, import prices rebounded 0.9% after slipping 0.3% in December. That was the biggest year-on-year gain since October 2018 and followed 11 straight monthly declines.
Inflation is being closely watched amid concerns from some quarters that President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVDO-19 recovery plan could cause the economy to overheat. But inflation is likely to be driven by the labor market, which is experiencing considering slack. 
The government last week reported a moderate increase in consumer prices in January. Producer prices recorded their largest increase since 2009 in January, in part reflecting bottlenecks in the supply chain caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Imported fuel prices increased 7.4% last month after soaring 8.1% in December. Imported food prices surged 2.1%. 
Excluding fuels and foods, import prices accelerated 0.8% after gaining 0.4% in December. The rise in the so-called core import prices reflected the dollar's 2.7% drop last year against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners.
Last month, the cost of goods imported from China rose 0.3% for a second straight month. Prices for imported capital goods gained 0.2%. The cost of imported motor vehicles rose 0.2%. Prices for consumer goods excluding autos dipped 0.1%.
The report also showed export prices surged 2.5% in January, the largest rise since the index was first published on a monthly basis in December 1988, after increasing 1.3% in December. Prices for agricultural exports rose 6.0%, while nonagricultural exports increased 2.2%.

The housing market has outperformed other sectors of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic, supported by lower mortgages rates and demand for spacious accommodations for home offices and schooling. But expensive inputs and lack of land pose a threat to continued robust housing market gains.
A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders edged up in February. But builders complained that record high lumber prices were ""adding thousands of dollars to the cost of a new home and causing some builders to abruptly halt projects.""
Softwood lumber prices jumped a record 73% on a year-on-year basis in January, according to data from the Labor Department. Still, the housing market remains supported by historically low mortgage rates and lean inventories of previously owned homes.
Permits for future homebuilding shot up 10.4% to a rate of 1.881 million units in January. Permits typically lead starts by one to two months.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, tumbled 12.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.162 million units. Single-family starts had increased for eight straight months. Single-family building permits rose 3.8% to a rate of 1.269 million units in January.

Investing.com -- The hoped-for improvement in the U.S. labor market failed to materialize, last week, as another wave of layoffs put the country on course for another disappointing payrolls report in two weeks' time.
Initial jobless claims rose to 861,000 last week, the Labor Department said, rather than falling to 765,000 as expected. To make it worse, the previous week's figures were revised upwards by over 50,000 to 848,000. As such, initial claims are still running fairly close to the recent peak of just over 900,000.
The number of continuing claims, which are calculated with a one-week lag to initial claims, also disappointed. They only inched down to 4.494 million from an upwardly revised 4.558 million. Analysts had expected a figure of 4.413 million.  
However, including those enrolled on pandemic-specific programs, the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits fell in the week through January 30 fell by some 1.3 million to 18.34 million.
Data from the housing market released at the same time showed that activity stayed at historically high rates in January, albeit coming slightly off December's 14-year high. Housing starts fell to 1.58 million from 1.68 million in December, a development that masked divergent trends for single- and multi-family build. Single-family starts fell 6% from the previous month, while multi-family starts - typically associated with rental property - rose 16.2%. 
The more forward-looking building permits data presented a stronger picture. They rose to an all-time high of 1.88 million, from 1.68 million a month earlier. They had been expected to fall slightly in monthly terms."

814,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 05:10PM ET</span>",Additional fiscal stimulus powers U.S. retail sales; manufacturing output strong,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in January after households received additional pandemic relief money from the government, suggesting a pick-up in economic activity after being restrained by a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections late last year.
The largest gain in retail sales in seven months reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday was across the board, and ended three straight monthly decreases. The acceleration in activity at the start of 2021 was evident in other data showing strong growth in production and prices at factories last month.
Still, the solid economic data did not argue against President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan. Millions of Americans remain unemployed. Though COVID-19 infection and hospitalization rates have declined, new strains of the virus pose a risk to the economy fully reopening. 
""The economy picked up steam in January and inflation came along for the ride,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Since President Biden is intent on getting a major bill through, look for that to happen and for government money to continue to get into the hands of households and businesses.""  
Retail sales surged by a seasonally adjusted 5.3% last month after decreasing 1.0% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales increasing 1.1% in January. 
Retail sales increased 7.4% from a year ago. Sales last month were led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships accelerating 3.1%. Sales at clothing stores soared 5.0%. Consumers also stepped up spending at restaurants and bars, boosting receipts 6.9%. Still, sales at restaurants and bars were down 16.6% compared to January 2020. 
Receipts at electronics and appliance stores powered ahead 14.7% and sales at furniture stores surged 12.0%. There were also hefty increases in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores.
Receipts at food and beverage stores rose solidly, as did those at building material stores. Online retail sales jumped 11.0% after dropping 7.3% in December.
GRAPHIC: Retail sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdpzembovw/retailsales.png
The government approved another coronavirus rescue package worth nearly $900 billion at the end of December, which included $600 checks to mostly low-income and some middle-income Americans. The bulk of the money was disbursed in early January, which supported discretionary spending last month. 
The package also extended a government-funded weekly unemployment subsidy as well as benefits for millions of people who do not qualify for state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their six months of eligibility. These benefits are set to expire in mid-March.
As with the previous stimulus checks, consumers saved a big chunk of the latest payouts.
""Less than a quarter of the stimulus check funds were quickly spent at retailers,"" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""We estimate that the personal saving rate moved up to around 20% last month."" 
Some of the sharp rebound was technical. The model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data typically anticipates a bigger post-holiday season drop in retail sales in January. The drop in unadjusted sales was the smallest since 1992, contributing to the big rise in the seasonally adjusted retail sales.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 6.0% last month after decreasing 2.4% in December. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
U.S. stocks fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
INFLATION BUILDING UP
Further gains in sales are expected in the months ahead. The Biden administration's recovery plan, under consideration in the U.S. Congress, will include an additional $1,400 check to households. The distribution of vaccines is improving, which should allow more restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses to reopen in the spring. 
Americans are sitting on $2.38 trillion in savings, which is expected could unleash pent-up demand for services like air travel and hotel accommodation, hardest hit by the pandemic.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said manufacturing production rose 1.0% last month after gaining 0.9% in December. The ninth straight monthly advance in factory production was despite a shortage of semiconductors weighing on the output of motor vehicles.
Graphic: Industrial output - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznvnoxnapl/industrialoutput.png
Solid manufacturing and robust core retail sales left economists to anticipate first-quarter GDP growth well above the 4.0% annualized rate logged in the fourth quarter.
""The blow-out retail sales report puts in place some initial strong scaffolding for growth in the first quarter of 2021,"" said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College. ""Underlying growth momentum is building as the third seasonal wave of the pandemic has moved over the hump, and the vaccination program is being accelerated.""
Firming economic activity is starting to boost inflation. In a third report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand jumped 1.3% last month, the biggest gain since December 2009. That followed a 0.3% rise in December.

Business inventories rose 0.6% in December after gaining 0.5% in November, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories rising 0.5% in December. Inventories fell 2.6% on a year-on-year basis in December.
Retail inventories increased 1.2% in December, instead of 1.0% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.7% rise in November. Motor vehicle inventories increased 1.1%, rather than 0.9% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, gained 1.2%, instead of 1.1% as estimated last month.
The economy grew at a 4.0% annualized rate in the fourth quarter after a historic 33.4% growth pace in the third quarter. Inventories contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic. That has helped to underpin manufacturing, offsetting slowing consumer spending.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.3% in December. Stocks at manufacturers also gained 0.3%.

Business sales jumped 0.8% in December after being unchanged in November. At December's sales pace, it would take 1.32 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from November.

Manufacturing production rose 1.0% last month after gaining 0.9% in December, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. That was the ninth straight monthly advance in factory production. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output increasing 0.7% in January. Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, has powered ahead as the pandemic left Americans grounded at home, shifting demand to household goods from services like airline travel and hotel accommodation.
Manufacturing momentum could slow in the spring as the distribution of vaccines reaches large swathes of the population, helping to slow the spread of the virus. That could unleash pent-up demand for travel.
Still, production at factories will be supported by low customer inventories, as well as lean stocks at manufacturers. A survey this month showed a dip in manufacturing sentiment in January.
The Fed report showed motor vehicles and parts output declined 0.7% in January. Production at auto plants has been hampered by a shortage of semiconductors. Motor vehicle production slipped 0.2% in December. Excluding autos, manufacturing output increased 1.0%.
The strength in manufacturing output combined with 2.3% jump in mining to lift industrial production by 0.9% in January. That followed a 1.3% surge in December. Industrial production remains below its pre-pandemic level. Utilities output fell 1.2%. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.7 percentage point to 74.6% in January. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector increased 0.7 percentage points to 75.6%. It is 4.0 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate rose at a faster pace in January, edging slightly ahead of analyst expectations on higher prices for durable goods and gasoline, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
The inflation rate accelerated to 1.0%, up from a year-on-year increase of 0.7% in December, and beating analyst expectations of 0.9%. 
Durable goods prices rose 1.7%, while gasoline prices were up 6.1% amid oil production cuts, though they remain 3.3% lower than January 2020 levels.
""In the next few months, with the run-up in oil prices in particular and other commodities, and when we compare ourselves to what happened a year ago, we are going to get some very big inflation numbers,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. 
""So I think this is just an opening salvo in terms of what we are about to see for headline inflation.""
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.2% lower at 1.2717 to the greenback, or 78.63 U.S. cents, as the greenback broadly rallied.
Two of the three core measures of inflation moved in January, with all remaining below the Bank of Canada's 2% target. The common measure, which the Bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was steady at 1.3%, while trim rose to 1.8% and median fell to 1.4%.
""I'd put more emphasis on a little bit weaker core inflation than the pop in the headline,"" said Derek Holt, vice president of Capital Markets Economics at Scotiabank. 
""We know that we're getting towards the bottom of a cycle if we're not there already. (The Bank of Canada's) greater concern should be about inflation outlook.""
The Bank of Canada has said it will keep its key rate at a record low 0.25% into 2023.

Statistics Canada noted that the rise in consumer prices occurred amid continuing economic uncertainty. Populous Ontario and Quebec were both under strict health restrictions in January as COVID-19 spread. Those restrictions are now being eased.

The producer price index for final demand jumped 1.3% last month, the biggest gain since December 2009 when the government revamped the series, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. That followed a 0.3% rise in December. In the 12 months through January, the PPI accelerated 1.7% after rising 0.8% in December.
A 1.3% rise in the prices of services accounted for two-thirds of the increase in the PPI. That was the biggest gain since December 2009 and followed a 0.1% drop in December. 
The cost of goods surged 1.4% after gaining 1.0% in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would rise 0.4% in January and gain 0.9% on a year-on-year basis.
Inflation is under focus this year amid concerns from some quarters that President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion recovery plan could lead to the overheating of the economy. The package, which would follow on the heels of nearly $900 billion in additional COVID-19 pandemic relief from the government in late December, is working its way thorough the U.S. Congress.
Higher inflation is anticipated by the spring as price declines early in the coronavirus crisis wash out of the calculations, but there is no consensus among economists on whether it would stick beyond the so-called base effects.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he expected the rise in price pressures would be transitory, citing three decades of lower and stable inflation. 
Slack in the labor market remains excessive, with at least 20 million Americans on unemployment benefits. 
The government last week reported a moderate rise in consumer prices in January. 
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices accelerated 1.2% in January. The so-called core PPI increased 0.4% in December. In the 12 months through January, the core PPI rose jumped 2.0% after gaining 1.1% in December.
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target, a flexible average. The U.S. central bank has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot its target. The core PCE price index is at 1.5%. 
Wholesale energy prices surged 5.1% after rising 4.9% in December. Food prices gained 0.2%. Core goods prices increased 0.8%. A 1.4% jump in prices for final demand services less trade, transportation, and warehousing accounted for more than 70% of the increase in services last month.

Healthcare costs accelerated 1.2%, while portfolio fees soared 9.4%. Those healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",UK inflation heads up as locked-down consumers spend from home,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation edged up in January as consumers hunkered down with new sofas and duvets and spent more on food, video games and other home entertainment as they went into a third national coronavirus lockdown.
Annual consumer price inflation rose to a three-month high of 0.7% last month, and many economists expect it to overshoot the Bank of England's 2% target later this year as temporary tax cuts and a cap on household fuel bills expire.
""That would knock on the head any lingering hopes of more policy stimulus from the Bank of England, although we doubt it would prompt tighter monetary policy, either,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
Customs fees and transport disruption caused by new post-Brexit red tape might also push up prices, though the Office for National Statistics said it saw no evidence of this yet.
Yields on 10- and 30-year British government bonds extended their recent climb and briefly hit their highest since March 2020 after Wednesday's data. Inflation worries have lifted yields globally as investors prepare for more fiscal stimulus in the United States.
Economists polled by Reuters had mostly thought the consumer price index would hold at December's 0.6% increase.
Food and drink prices rose by 0.6% from December to January, compared with a 0.2% fall over the same period a year earlier. Furniture and household goods prices dropped by 1.5%, a smaller decline than a year earlier at a time of year when there are normally big seasonal sales.
The costs for ""games, toys and hobbies"" was 3.4% higher than a month earlier, adding materially to overall inflation.
By contrast, clothing and footwear prices fell by the most between December and January in seven years as retailers, with their stores closed, tried to offload stock.
The shift to working and relaxing at home has also fed through into greater demand for housing, accelerated by a temporary tax break that is due to expire on March 31. 
House prices in December were up by 8.5%, the ONS said, the biggest annual increase in over six years. Later private-sector data has pointed to a cooling in prices as the end of the tax break nears.
INFLATION TO RISE, BOE TO WAIT
British inflation has been below the BoE's 2% target since mid-2019 and came close to zero last year as the economy tanked.
The BoE expects it will accelerate in the spring as last year's emergency cut in value-added tax for the hospitality sector expires and oil prices rise on expectations of recovery. 
But the BoE has stressed it will be in no hurry to start removing its huge stimulus.
Samuel Tombs, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said higher annual price rises for furniture and household appliances might reflect higher shipping and Brexit-related costs.
A core version of the CPI, which excludes volatile fuel and food prices, held steady at 1.4%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports accelerated in January, led by a jump in Chinese demand, and manufacturers' sentiment turned positive for the first time since 2019 signalling a gradual recovery from last year's deep coronavirus slump.
Core machinery orders, a volatile but leading indicator of capital spending, unexpectedly rose in December, an encouraging sign for a private sector-led recovery, even as renewed curbs to contain the pandemic weighed on business activity.
Despite the upbeat indicators, however, analysts warn the recovery momentum in the world's third-largest economy could stall as policymakers struggle to balance the need to contain the virus against the need to revive growth and fix Japan's dire finances.
""The economy's recovery is pausing in the current quarter, although development of coronavirus vaccines may reduce risks ahead,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""Uncertainty remains high for both exports and machinery orders, as delays in vaccinations or resumption of activity among the public on expectations for vaccines could heighten risks of another wave of virus resurgence.""
The indicators followed fourth-quarter gross domestic product data on Monday that showed Japan's economy grew more than expected, as a fast-recovering Chinese economy helped boost exports and capital expenditure.
Ministry of Finance data showed on Wednesday exports rose 6.4% in January from a year earlier, roughly in line with a 6.6% increase seen by economists in a Reuters poll and following a 2.0% gain in December.
By region, exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, jumped 37.5% in the year to January, the biggest gain since April 2010, led by chip-making equipment, plastics and nonferrous metal. The big gain is partly due to the base effect of the large decline seen a year before when the Lunar New Year holidays, which weighs on trade activity, fell in January, a ministry official said.
U.S.-bound shipments fell 4.8%, dragged down by airplanes, motors and car parts.
Reflecting soft domestic demand, imports fell 9.5% in the year to January, versus the median estimate for a 6.0% drop, swinging a trade balance to a deficit of 323.9 billion yen ($3.05 billion).
Analysts expect Japan's economy to contract in the current quarter, as service consumption is hit hard by renewed state of emergency curbs issued last month and set to last until March.
Separate data by the Cabinet Office showed core machinery orders, considered an indicator of capital spending for the next six to nine months, rose 5.2% in December from the previous month, versus a 6.2% drop expected.
The government described machinery orders as picking up, marking an upgrade for the third straight month from its previous assessment that they were showing signs of a pick-up.
Raising worries about the outlook, however, manufacturers surveyed by the Cabinet Office expected core orders to fall 8.5% in January-March, after advancing 16.8% in the previous quarter.
Japanese manufacturers' morale turned positive for the first time since July 2019 in February, the Reuters Tankan survey showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Sentiment among Japanese manufacturers turned positive in February for the first time since mid-2019, the Reuters Tankan poll found, lifted by improving overseas demand though caution about the ongoing fallout from the coronavirus persisted.
The monthly poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey, found non-manufacturers confidence remained gloomy as pandemic measures covering Tokyo and other cities hit consumers and some firms hard.
While the Reuters Tankan showed overall sentiment was expected to recover over the coming three months, respondents were on guard for further blows to demand, especially for the hard-hit consumer sector.
The sentiment index for manufacturers rose to 3 from minus 1 in the previous month, led by chemicals and manufactured food, the first time it has turned positive since July 2019. The index was seen recovering to 8 in May, according to the Feb. 2-12 survey.
Firms that were optimistic about the current business state said pointed to a stable market environment and exchange rate as evidence of a broader global economic recovery. 
""The car market in China is recovering and demand for electronic components is increasing,"" a manager at an electric machinery maker wrote in the survey. ""The car markets in Europe and the United States are good as well.""
But in the poll of 482 large- and mid-sized firms, in which 231 firms responded on condition of anonymity, managers also complained about low shipment volumes and cautious consumer behaviour.
""The spreading of the coronavirus is putting a brake on economic activity as a whole,"" said a manager at a service company.
A manager at a chemistry firm said a recovery in shipment volumes from the jolt the virus gave to the global economy was slow.
The non-manufacturers' index remained in negative territory in February, rising four points to minus 7 from minus 11 in the previous month, dragged down by the other services and wholesalers sectors.
The index was expected to be flat in May, partly due to a strongly positive outlook for the information/communications sector.
Japan's economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, the government said on Monday, extending its recovery from its worst postwar recession thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that boosted exports and capital spending.
But the recovery slowed from the prior quarter's strong growth and the ongoing state of emergency curbs are casting a dark cloud over the outlook.
""Customers are cautious about capital spending as the spread of the coronavirus can't be expected to halt,"" another manager at a machinery maker wrote in the survey.

The Reuters Tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.

It was the first time the economy had shrunk since a marginal decline in 2002, but Israel in 2020 outperformed a 5.5% average contraction in OECD countries.
The economy, which grew 3.4% in 2019, had been expected to shrink 3.3% to 3.7% in 2020 based on government and central bank estimates because of COVID-19.
Growth is expected to rebound in 2021, with the Bank of Israel forecasting a 6.3% rise if Israel's rapid COVID-19 vaccination pace is maintained.
Despite a third lockdown, the economy grew an annualised 6.3% in the fourth quarter after a 41.5% jump in the third quarter. Analysts on average had projected a 0.5% decline.

In 2020, private spending declined 9.4%, while exports rose 0.6% despite the crisis and a stronger shekel. Imports slid 8.1%, investment in fixed assets dipped 1.5%, while government spending gained 2.9% last year.

The ZEW said its survey of investors' economic sentiment showed a rise to 71.2 points from 61.8 the previous month. A Reuters poll had pointed to a fall to 59.6, and the February reading surpassed even the highest forecast, of 68.0.
The read-out, which came as a separate read-out showed euro zone output fell less than initially estimated in the last quarter of 2020, boosted the euro.
""The financial market experts are optimistic about the future. They are confident that the German economy will be back on the growth track within the next six months,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
""Consumption and retail trade in particular are expected to recover significantly, accompanied by higher inflation expectations,"" he added.
A separate gauge of current conditions eased to -67.2 from -66.4 the previous month. That compared with a consensus forecast of -67.0 points.
The Economy Ministry said on Monday lockdown measures to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in Germany will continue to weigh on the economy in the first quarter of 2021, but prospects for exporters are cautiously positive.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and the premiers of Germany's states agreed last Wednesday to extend restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus until March 7. 
German exports rose in December as solid trade with China and the United States helped the economy as it struggles to grow under the lockdown restrictions.
Last week, German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) raised its full-year outlook for the first time in nearly four years, and CEO Martina Merz said ""we're noticing signs of an economic recovery"".
Separately, the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro contracted 0.6% quarter-on-quarter in the October-December period, for a 5.0% year-on-year decline. Eurostat earlier estimated the contraction was 0.7% in the quarter and 5.1% in annual terms.

Eurostat also said that employment grew 0.3% on the quarter in the last three months of 2020 after a 1.0% quarterly rise in the previous three months. It was still 2.0% lower than in the same period a year earlier.

While family-owned companies - particularly in Europe and the United States - looked to charitable giving and helping employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, most put sustainability on the back burner, the consulting firm's survey of 2,801 family business owners showed.
Without the investor pressure that listed companies face to conform to and set environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards, family businesses have implemented what PwC described as an ""increasingly out-of-date conception of how businesses should respond to society"".
""It is clear that family businesses globally have a strong commitment to a wider social purpose,"" Peter Englisch, global family business leader at PwC, said in a statement.
Most of them had made retaining staff a priority during the pandemic, for example, and some 80% engaged in proactive social responsibility in some form, often via philanthropy.
But more than three-quarters of the U.S.-based family businesses and 60% of those in Britain placed greater emphasis on direct societal contributions, mainly through charity, over a strategic approach to ESG matters.
Asian family businesses far outperformed their American and European peers in the self-reported incorporation of sustainability into their fundamental approach to business, the survey found.

The report noted that larger family businesses, and those owned by second- or later-generation family members, also showed a greater focus on sustainability.

Unemployment in the euro zone's second biggest economy fell 1.1 percentage points to 8%, official data showed on Tuesday. That compared with a revised 9.1% in the third quarter and 8.1% in the last three months of 2019.
Unemployment fell fastest amongst 15-24 year olds, and marginally quicker among women than men. The number of workers on a long-term contract edged higher to 49.8% from 49.2% in the previous quarter as some hiring activity resumed, INSEE said.
Before the pandemic struck, President Emmanuel Macron had been chasing a goal of 7% unemployment by the end of his five-year term in 2022. He inherited a jobless rate of 9.5% in May 2017 and set about liberalising the labour market.

The French jobless rate stood above 10% throughout the 2012-2017 term of Macron's socialist predecessor, Francois Hollande.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy expanded more than expected in the fourth quarter, extending the recovery from its worst postwar recession thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that boosted exports and capital spending.
But the recovery slowed from the third quarter's brisk pace and new state of emergency curbs cloud the outlook, underscoring the challenge policymakers face in preventing the spread of COVID-19 without choking off a fragile recovery, especially in the battered consumer sector.
""Conditions are such that Japan will not be able to avoid negative growth in the first quarter,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""There is a high possibility that there will be a repeating cycle of coronavirus infections spreading and being contained this year, which means that consumption is not likely to recover at the expected pace.""
The world's third-largest economy grew an annualised 12.7% in October-December, government data showed on Monday, exceeding a median market forecast of 9.5%.
It was slower than the revised 22.7% surge the previous quarter, when the economy got a lift from pent-up demand after a previous state of emergency was lifted in May.
For the full coronavirus-stricken year, Japan's economy contracted 4.8%, the first annual fall since 2009.
But Japan's October-December performance was stronger than U.S. growth of 4% and a 2.8% slump in the euro zone. With two straight quarters of solid growth, Japan's economy likely recouped 90% of pandemic-induced losses, analysts say.
""Japan's recovery proceeded at a much faster pace than initially expected,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""There's still some distance toward a full normalisation, but economic activity is recovering toward pre-pandemic levels.""
Japanese shares surged to close at over 30-year highs on rising expectations for a rebound in corporate earnings and economic growth.
OUTLOOK MURKY
Japan's stronger-than-expected GDP data comes amid signs the pandemic's hit to other Asian economies toward the end of last year was not as severe as first feared.
Figures released on Monday showed that GDP in Singapore and Thailand shrank less than expected in the fourth quarter. [nL4N2KI1FR].
A global rebound in manufacturing gave Japan's exports and capital expenditure a much-needed boost on strong shipments to a rapidly recovering Chinese economy.
External demand, or exports minus imports, added 1.0% point to fourth-quarter GDP growth thanks to a 11.1% surge in exports buoyed by shipments of electronic parts and autos to China.
Capital expenditure also grew 4.5%, marking the first increase in three quarters, as companies proceeded with spending that had been put off last year due to the pandemic.
Private consumption, which makes up more than half of the economy, rose 2.2%, slowing from the 5.1% increase the previous quarter but exceeding market forecasts for a 1.8% gain.
The outlook, however, remains highly uncertain as Japan lags Western countries in rolling out vaccines.
A resurgence in infections forced the government to terminate a controversial travel discount campaign that had supported service spending in October and November.
Analysts expect the economy to contract in the current quarter, as retailers take a hit from renewed state of emergency curbs rolled out in January and set to last until early March.
""If state of emergency measures are lifted in March, Japan's economy will probably rebound in April-June,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""But we can't count on a big expansion as it's likely to take time for vaccine shots to reach the wider population.""
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said the economy in the current quarter would unlikely suffer a contraction as large as its worst postwar slump earlier last year. 

""I don't expect the economy will shrink as much as we saw last spring but there are people who are in a severe situation, so we want to support businesses, jobs and people's livelihoods.""

The survey of nearly 300 firms, by consultants South West Manufacturing Advisory Service (SWMAS) and the Manufacturing Growth Programme, a government and European Union-funded initiative providing support to small firms, adds to the picture of disruption from new customs checks that came into force on Jan. 1 for goods trade with the EU.
""Price hikes in the supply chain have been immediate, and we are hearing tales of lead times being extended on raw materials,"" said Nick Golding, managing director of SWMAS.
Some 65% of manufacturers reported higher costs, and 54% said they had greater difficulties exporting goods to the EU.
Around a fifth of manufacturers thought they might gain from customers bringing work back to Britain from the EU.
Britain's government has said many of the difficulties are ""teething troubles"" and last week said it would make 20 million pounds ($27.7 million) available to help small firms get used to the new rules. Further restrictions are due to take effect later this year.
Earlier this month the Bank of England forecast that Brexit-related trade disruption would reduce economic output by 1% during the current quarter - equivalent to about 5 billion pounds - and it expects trade to fall by 10% in the long term.

Brexit supporters say Britain will gain long-term advantages by setting its own trade rules with countries outside Europe, as well as from greater control over domestic regulation.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's economy contracted less than initially estimated in the fourth quarter, putting the country on a path to a gradual recovery in 2021 after it marked its worst ever recession last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) fell 2.4% year-on-year in the quarter, the ministry of trade and industry said on Monday, versus the 3.8% drop seen in the government's advance estimate. Analysts had expected a contraction of 3.5%, according to a Reuters poll.
""The Singapore economy is projected to see a gradual recovery in 2021, with GDP not expected to return to pre-COVID levels until the second half of the year,"" said Gabriel Lim, the ministry's permanent secretary. 
The government expects GDP to grow 4% to 6% this year. The economy shrank 5.4% in 2020, marking its worst ever recession, compared with the advance estimate of 5.8%.
The government said outward-oriented sectors are likely to benefit from a pickup in global economic activity, but activity levels in sectors related to tourism and aviation are projected to remain below pre-pandemic levels even by the end of 2021. 
""The outlook ahead stays uneven, although we are optimistic overall,"" said Jeff Ng, senior treasury strategist at HL Bank. ""Barring another round of downside risks materialising, we see some possibilities of Singapore even outperforming our 2021 GDP forecast of 6.3%.""
Singapore, a travel and transport hub, has brought its COVID-19 situation under control with few new local cases and it has begun its vaccination programme. However, the pace of border re-opening has slowed due to the global surge in cases and the emergence of more contagious strains of the virus.
""For the broader economy and macro economy level, I think a large part of our recovery is still going to be somewhat linked to what's going on in the rest of the world rather than domestically,"" Lim said, citing the city-state's open and trade-reliant economy. 
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded by 3.8% in the fourth quarter. 
The data comes a day ahead of the city-state's budget announcement. Economists expect an expansionary but trimmed down budget to support businesses still struggling from the impact of the coronavirus.
The central bank left monetary policy unchanged at its last meeting in October and said its accommodative stance would remain appropriate for some time. 

Edward Robinson, Deputy Managing Director, Monetary Authority of Singapore, told a media briefing current policy stance was unchanged.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly fell in early February amid growing pessimism about the economy among households with annual incomes below $75,000, even as the government is poised to deliver another round of COVID-19 relief money.
The ebb in sentiment reported by the University of Michigan on Friday was also despite a decline in new coronavirus cases and an improvement in the distribution of vaccines. It underscored the so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out.
The government provided nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus in late December, which included direct cash payments to mostly lower-income households and an extension of a weekly unemployment supplement. The U.S. Congress is working on President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion recovery plan, which would see more stimulus checks sent to poor families. 
""The decline in confidence is a bit of a surprise since it was driven by the outlook,"" said John Ryding, chief economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. ""It appears ... (to) be another page in the tale of two economies or K-shaped recovery theme.""  
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index slipped to a reading of 76.2 in the first half of this month, attributed entirely to households with incomes below $75,000. That was down from a final reading of 79 in January. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index little changed at 80.8.
The survey's measure of current economic conditions dipped to a reading of 86.2 this month from 86.7 in January. Its gauge of consumer expectations dropped to 69.8 from 74.0 in January.
Among lower-income households, only 23% reported improved finances, the lowest since 2014. That compared to 54% among higher-income households. Just 17% of lower-income families reported income gains this month, compared with 44% of upper-income households.
About 53% of consumers expected the economy will continue to perform poorly in the year ahead, up from 51% in January.
Stocks on Wall Street were little changed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
STRONGER GROWTH
Economists expect the pessimism to abate in the coming months, given the encouraging developments on the virus, which together with the planned additional fiscal stimulus are seen allowing more parts of the economy to reopen by the summer.
""We expect consumers will become more upbeat as the next fiscal package, which distributes much of its benefits to lower-income households, comes online, and as vaccine dispersion increases,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""Improved sentiment should support the strong pickup in consumer spending we expect around mid-year."" 
Indeed, a separate survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on Friday showed forecasters expected stronger economic growth over the next three years than they did when they were polled last quarter. 
They, however, anticipated slower job growth. The findings were similar to a Reuters survey. 
The University of Michigan survey also showed consumers this month appeared to anticipate higher inflation in the near-term. The survey's one-year inflation expectation rose to 3.3%, the highest since July 2014, from 3.0% in January. 
That broadly fits in with inflation expectations on Wall Street, with the massive fiscal stimulus and pent-up demand for services as COVID-19 cases subside seen unleashing faster economic growth. 
Higher inflation is also expected by the spring as price declines early in the coronavirus crisis wash out of the calculations, but there is no consensus on whether it would stick beyond the so-called base effects.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday while he expected base effects and pent-up demand when the economy fully reopens to boost inflation, that was likely to be transitory, citing three decades of lower and stable prices.
The survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook was unchanged at 2.7%. The Fed, which has a 2% inflation target, focuses on long-term inflation expectations.

""We think Fed officials will welcome that steady rise as evidence that inflation expectations are returning to a level consistent with their 2% average inflation target,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's coronavirus-ravaged economy suffered its biggest crash in output in more than 300 years in 2020 when it slumped by 9.9%, but it avoided heading back towards recession at the end of the year and looks on course for a recovery in 2021.
Official figures showed gross domestic product (GDP) grew 1.0% from October through December, the top of a range of economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll.
This makes it likely that Britain will escape two straight quarters of contraction - the standard definition of recession in Europe - even though the economy is set to shrink in early 2021 due to the effects of a third COVID lockdown.
""As and when restrictions are eased, we continue to expect a vigorous rebound in the economy,"" said Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Britain's economy grew 1.2% in December alone, after a 2.3% fall in output in November when there was a partial lockdown, pointing to greater resilience to COVID restrictions than at the start of the pandemic.
That left output 6.3% lower than in February before the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said.
However, the Bank of England forecasts the economy will shrink by 4% in the first three months of 2021 because of the new lockdown and Brexit disruption.
It thinks it will take until early 2022 before GDP regains its pre-COVID size, assuming vaccination continues at the current rapid pace, which outstrips the rest of Europe's. Many economists think recovery will take longer. 
""Today's figures show that the economy has experienced a serious shock as a result of the pandemic, which has been felt by countries around the world,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Sunak, facing the heaviest borrowing since World War Two, said he would continue to focus on protecting jobs when he sets out a new annual budget on March 3.
Unemployment has risen much less than feared at the start of the crisis, largely due to subsidies to keep people in work, though sectors such as hospitality and high-street retail remain hard hit.
HARDER HIT THAN MOST 
Last year's fall in output was the biggest since modern official records began after World War Two. Longer-running historical data hosted by the Bank of England suggest it was the biggest drop since 1709, when Britain suffered a ""Great Frost"".
Britain has reported Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19 and is among the world's highest in terms of deaths per head. 
The GDP fall is steeper than almost any other big economy's, though Spain - also hard-hit by the virus - suffered an 11% decline.
Some of the damage reflects how Britain's economy relies more on face-to-face consumer services than other countries, as well as disruption to schooling and routine healthcare, which few other countries factored in to GDP.
Sunak, in an interview with Sky News, said Britain's economic performance could be seen as being marginally above that of some of its peers last year.
GDP is almost always compared on a ""real"" or inflation-adjusted basis, which shows Britain was the worst performer in the Group of Seven large advanced economies. But Sunak said Britain did better on a ""nominal"" basis, which ignores inflation.
Taking this approach, Britain's economy is closer to its pre-crisis size than Germany, France or Italy's, according to figures provided by the ONS, which said it ""may be useful"" to look at nominal as well as real measures of GDP.
But most international differences on inflation adjustment centre on government spending, and looking at household spending alone, Britain remains a laggard. Household spending in the fourth quarter was 8.4% below pre-crisis levels, compared with a 2.6% shortfall in the United States and 6.8% in France.

""The UK's underperformance can't simply be attributed to the different way the ONS measures government expenditure to most other countries,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 793,000 for the week ended Feb. 6. Data for the prior week was revised to show 33,000 more claims received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 757,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims decreased 36,534 to 813,145 last week. There were notable jumps in filings in California and Ohio. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state programs, 1.148 million people filed claims last week.
Claims are stuck in the upper end of their 711,000-842,000 band between October and November. They remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession, though they are below the record 6.867 million reported last March when the pandemic hit the United States.
The labor market recovery has stalled in recent months as the country battled a resurgence in coronavirus infections, which ravaged restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses. The government reported last Friday that the economy created only 49,000 jobs in January after losing 227,000 in December.
Labor market woes strengthen the case for President Joe Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion recovery package, which is under consideration in the U.S. Congress. The government provided nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief in late December. Republican lawmakers are opposing the planned massive fiscal stimulus due to concerns about the swelling national debt.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower.
LONG BOUTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
But there are glimmers of hope on the horizon. Reported new coronavirus cases in the United States dropped 25% last week, the biggest fall since the pandemic hit the nation. Infections have now fallen for four consecutive weeks, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county reports.
Should the trend continue and the distribution of vaccines broaden out, that, together with additional stimulus, could allow more businesses to reopen. There are signs that businesses are testing the waters. Temporary help jobs, a segment normally considered a harbinger of future hiring, jumped in January.
""Temporary and contract jobs are running slightly ahead of where they were the same time a year ago,"" said Richard Wahlquist, chief executive officer at the American Staffing Association.
For now, the slack in the labor market remains immense. The claims report showed that people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 145,000 to 4.545 million in the week ended Jan. 30. But the decline in the so-called continuing claims was mostly due to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states.
At least 4.778 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended Jan. 23, up 1.2 million from the prior period. These benefits, which are funded by the government, will expire in mid-March if Congress does not pass the Biden administration's relief package. 
Another 1.653 million were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. That meant 6.4 million people have been unemployed for more than six months.
""This is by the far the highest we have seen at any point during this crisis,"" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Long-term joblessness is happening right now and is a very real challenge for the recovery."" 
About 20.435 million people were receiving benefits under all programs during that period, an increase of 2.6 million from mid-January. The surge partly reflected the extension of government-funded benefits in late December, and underscored the widespread nature of unemployment.
""The unemployed are having a difficult time reentering the labor force, and this highlights the need for additional federal aid,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. 

The economy has recovered 12.3 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated employment would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024.

835,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 08:37AM ET</span>",U.S. Jobless Claims Make No Headway as Revisions Wipe Out Last Week's Drop,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com --The number of people filing initial claims for unemployment benefits again came in higher than expected, extending a sequence of only minimal declines as the pandemic continues to generate high numbers of layoffs.
Initial jobless claims totaled 793,000 last week, some 36,000 higher than the 757,000 expected ahead of time by economists. In absolute terms, that was still a decline from the previous week's number, which was revised higher to 812,000 from an initial estimate of 779,000.
The rate of initial claims hit its slowest since the pandemic back in early December and has run fairly constantly at around 800,000 a week since then. 
The number of people making continuing claims also came in above expectations at 4.545 million, but likewise indicated a drop from an upwardly revised number for the previous week.  
Continuing claims are calculated with a one-week lag to initial ones, and thus date to January 23rd. As of that date, there were a total of 20.44 million claiming jobless benefits of various sorts. That represented a rise of over 2.5 million from the previous week, owing to big increases in the use of two special schemes related to the pandemic. These have recently regained importance after Congress extended eligibility for the programs in the dying days of the Trump administration. 
The numbers underline the slow nature of progress as the U.S. starts to emerge from the worst surge yet in Covid-19 cases. The economy has lost around 10 million jobs on a net basis since the pandemic exploded a year ago. January's labor market report showed a net gain of fewer than 50,000 jobs through the middle of the month, although private payrolls processor ADP has indicated that private-sector hiring was substantially stronger.
In a keynote speech on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had stressed the need for fiscal policy to give ""continued support"" to both households and businesses, while promising that the Fed's monetary policy would remain ""patiently accommodative."" 
“Published unemployment rates during Covid have dramatically understated the deterioration in the labor market,” Powell said."
836,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>","Nearly half of UK goods exporters see Brexit trade trouble, BCC says","By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Just under half of British companies that export goods have run into difficulties caused by the Brexit shift in trade terms with the European Union since the start of the year, a British Chambers of Commerce survey showed on Thursday.
Some 49% of goods exporters said adapting to the changes had caused problems, while one in five services exporters reported issues, the BCC said.
The findings are in line with other surveys that show British companies struggled with supply chain issues last month, with the shift in trading arrangements exacerbating problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Trading businesses – and the UK's chances at a strong economic recovery – are being hit hard by changes at the border,"" said BCC director general Adam Marshall.
""For some firms these concerns are existential, and go well beyond mere 'teething problems',"" added Marshall, repeating the phrase used by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to describe the recent trade problems.
Marshall warned that the situation could worsen if Britain sticks to its plan to introduce checks on live animals and animal products from the EU in April, and for full customs checks from July.
""These timescales need to change – and the support available for businesses who are battling to adapt to new trading conditions significantly increased,"" Marshall said.
Last week an HSBC UK survey showed 40% of British importers and exporters said the shift to a new trading arrangement with the EU had made trade more cumbersome.
British manufacturers suffered the biggest deterioration in their supply chain out of almost 30 countries covered by IHS Markit's business surveys in January. 
Trade analysts think some of the extra cost and bureaucracy will be permanent, and the Bank of England has forecast they will lower trade by 10% in the long run compared with a frictionless arrangement. 

Proponents of Brexit say Britain will ultimately benefit by striking its own trade deals and forming its own regulations outside the EU.

837,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 07:10PM ET</span>",UK housing market boom loses steam: RICS,"LONDON (Reuters) - The boom in Britain's housing market cooled sharply in January as the country went back into coronavirus lockdown and a tax break for buyers neared its expiry, a survey showed on Thursday.
House price growth slowed more than expected by economists polled by Reuters and prices in London fell for the first time since July, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said.
A measure of properties hitting the market was the second-weakest on record, excluding a slump during the first lockdown last year when the sector was closed along with much of the ret of the economy.
Near-term sales expectations were close to a pre-pandemic record low. New buyer enquires and agreed sales also fell.
Britain's housing market unexpectedly took off in the late spring of 2020 as people who had been stuck in their houses during the first lockdown sought bigger homes. A tax break for buyers also spurred demand.
The stamp duty tax exemption is due to expire at the end of next month although media have said finance minister Rishi Sunak might extend it in his March 3 budget statement.
Other gauges of the housing market have also suggested recently that last year's boom has run its course, including the first month-on-month falls since mid-2020 in house prices as measured by mortgage lenders Nationwide and Halifax. 
A Reuters poll of analysts published last week showed prices were expected to flat-line this year before rising by 2.7% in 2022.
RICS Chief Economist Simon Rubinsohn said despite attempts to keep the housing market open in the latest lockdown that began in January, there had been an impact on activity.
""The appeal of properties with more room and outside space is, meanwhile, a theme that continues to be strongly evident in the responses to the survey,"" he said.

In the rental market, concerns about a slow flow of properties coming on to the market - reflecting regulatory and tax changes - were pushing rents higher. The exception, again, was London where private rents were viewed as remaining under pressure over the coming months.

838,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 05:55PM ET</span>",Cheaper airline tickets help to keep lid on U.S. inflation in January,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose moderately in January as higher gasoline prices were blunted by a slump in airline fares amid a relentless pandemic, tempering expectations for a sustained acceleration in inflation this year. 
The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed underlying consumer prices were unchanged for a second straight month. Inflation is under the spotlight, with economic growth expected to be juiced by fiscal stimulus and coronavirus vaccines becoming accessible to large swaths of the population, unleashing pent-up demand for services. 
Higher inflation is anticipated by the spring as price declines early in the coronavirus crisis wash out of the calculations, but there is no consensus among economists on whether it would stick beyond the so-called base effects.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday while he expected base effects and pent-up demand when the economy fully reopens to boost inflation, that was likely to be transitory, citing three decades of lower and stable prices.
""As the economy reopens we may see a burst of spending ... there could be some upward pressure on prices there, again though, my expectations would be that would be neither large nor sustained,"" Powell said at an Economic Club of New York event. 
The consumer price index rose 0.3% last month after gaining 0.2% in December. In the 12 months through January the CPI increased 1.4% after climbing 1.3% in December. Last month's rise in the CPI was in line with economists' expectations.
Gasoline prices jumped 7.4% in January, accounting for most of the increase in the CPI, after rising 5.2% in December. Food prices gained 0.1%, but the cost of food consumed at home fell 0.1%. Prices for food consumed away from home climbed 0.3%.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI was unchanged for a second consecutive month. The so-called core CPI was restrained by a 3.2% plunge in the cost of airline tickets. That offset increases in the prices of health care, motor vehicle insurance and tobacco. The core CPI rose 1.4% on a year-on-year basis, slowing from December's 1.6% advance. 
The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target, a flexible average. The U.S. central bank has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot its target. The core PCE price index is at 1.5%.
Stocks on Wall Street were slightly higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
EYES ON SERVICES
The U.S. government provided nearly $900 billion in pandemic relief in late December. President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion recovery package, which is winding its way through Congress. In addition to the fiscal stimulus, the Fed has slashed interest rates to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through bond purchases.
The Fed is expected to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance until mid-2023. Some economists believe the combination of generous fiscal stimulus and very accommodative monetary policy will stoke inflation this year. The pandemic has also caused bottlenecks in the supply chain, leading to a surge in prices of raw materials and other inputs at factories. 
A survey this month showed a measure of prices paid by manufacturers jumped to its highest level in nearly 10 years in January. Consumers are also anticipating higher inflation.
""Inflation is on its way thanks to fiscal and monetary stimulus and pent-up consumer demand that should intensify as the economy reopens,"" said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
But other economists argue that labor market slack, characterized by at least 17.8 million people on unemployment benefits, would make it harder for inflation to become entrenched. They also believe the services sector, which has been fractured by the pandemic, will determine the path of inflation. Spending on services, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, is 7.5% below the pre-pandemic level.
""Excess capacity in wide swathes of the economy, and low wage pressures from elevated unemployment will all keep inflation low over the next couple of years, especially for services, which make up more than one-half of consumer spending,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Inflation will be stronger in a few areas with elevated demand, such as building materials and food purchased for home use.""
In January, apparel prices increased 2.2%, rising for a third straight month. The cost of healthcare rose 0.4%, driven by a jump in prices for doctor visits. Consumers, however, paid less for prescription medication. Used cars and trucks, as well as new motor vehicles were cheaper. 
Prices for household furnishings, communication and alcohol fell. Rents remained moderate. 

Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, nudged up 0.1%, matching the rise in December. Many tenants have entered into forbearance agreements with landlords.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a budget deficit of $163 billion in January, a record high for the month and a $130 billion jump from the deficit in the same month last year, as a new round of direct payments to individuals were distributed, the Treasury said on Wednesday.
Receipts for January rose 3% from the year-earlier period to $385 billion, while outlays grew 35% to $547 billion. Both receipts and outlays were record highs for January.
For the first four months of the 2021 fiscal year, the deficit rose 89% to $736 billion, with receipts rising 1% to $1.19 trillion and outlays increasing 23% to $1.92 trillion. The deficit, receipts and outlays were all year-to-date record highs.
The January deficit would have been considerably larger if not for some $44 billion in benefits being paid in December because the New Year's Day holiday came at the start of a weekend.
Receipts last month were helped by an 18% increase in individual non-withheld tax payments, and a 49% increase in corporate tax payments, the latter of which a Treasury official said were increased by the repatriation of overseas earnings.
The official said January outlays were increased by about $139 billion in direct payments by the Treasury to individuals, mostly through $600 checks sent out as part of a year-end COVID-19 stimulus bill. Replenished unemployment benefits and rental assistance also boosted U.S. outlays, the official said.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday business applications surged 42.6% to a seasonally adjusted 492,133 last month. The data is derived from business applications for tax identifications. 
There were a seasonally adjusted 54,635 applications from corporations. Applications for businesses with planned wages totaled 58,023. Overall, applications increased in all four regions last month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has decimated businesses in the services sector, especially restaurants and bars, leaving millions unemployed.

The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories rose 0.3% in December instead of gaining 0.1% as reported last month. Stock at wholesalers was unchanged in November. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product shot up 0.7% in December.
Inventories fell 1.6% in December from a year earlier. 
The economy grew at a 4.0% annualized rate in the fourth quarter after a historic 33.4% growth pace in the third quarter. Inventories contributed to GDP growth for two straight quarters. 
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic. That has helped to underpin manufacturing, offsetting slowing consumer spending. 

Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts tumbled 3.3%. Sales at wholesalers surged 1.2% in December after rising 0.3% in November. At December's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.29 months to clear shelves, down from 1.31 in November.

843,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>","U.S. Core Consumer Prices Are Unchanged, Showing Scant Inflation","(Bloomberg) -- A key measure of prices paid by U.S. consumers was unchanged in January for a second straight month, underscoring the pandemic’s lingering restraint on inflation.
The core consumer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 1.4% from the prior year, a Labor Department report showed Wednesday. The broader CPI once again got a boost from higher gasoline prices, advancing 0.3% from the prior month and 1.4% from a year earlier.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists for month-over-month core CPI was for a 0.2% gain. The overall measure was projected to rise 0.3%.
The CPI data are part of an intensifying debate in financial markets over the course of inflation. Despite the tame January figure, price pressures are set to firm in the months ahead. That’s partly a reflection of expectations that Congress will pass another large aid package and an anticipated pickup in demand as more are vaccinated against the coronavirus.
At the same time, a jobless rate that indicates elevated slack in the labor market is seen limiting wage growth, which makes up the biggest share of companies’ total costs.
The report showed declining prices for used and new vehicles and transportation services. At the same time, Americans are paying higher prices for fuel, apparel and medical care services.
Lawmakers continue to debate the size of the next pandemic relief package. President Joe Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion plan, which some economists have warned could spur an outbreak of inflation. Other economists say there’s plenty of room for fiscal stimulus without fear of a more durable increase in price pressures.
Looking ahead, inflation metrics are expected to be distorted by so-called base effects in the coming months. Because of the pandemic and the recession it spurred, the CPI fell in March, April and May. When the annual figures are calculated this year, inflation will appear to be quickly accelerating when compared with the first three months of the health crisis.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said policy makers will ensure monetary policy continues to be a strong support to the economy “until the recovery is complete.” That, paired with the central bank’s willingness to let inflation run above its 2% objective for a period, means the Fed will likely leave interest rates near zero for some time.
How fast the labor market recovers will also play a role. Persistently high unemployment would limit workers’ ability to demand higher wages, limiting the degree to which inflation heats up. Powell is scheduled to speak Wednesday afternoon on the economic outlook.

Investing.com – China’s factory gate prices rose in annual terms, and at the fastest rate since May 2019, in January for the first time in a year.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day showed that January’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 1% month-on-month, against the 1% in forecast prepared by Investing.com and December’s 0.7% growth. However, the CPI fell 0.3% year-on-year, against the predicted 0.1% drop and December's 0.2% growth.
The data also showed that January's Producer Price Index (PPI) grew 0.3% year-on-year, smaller than the forecast 0.4% growth but improving on December’s 0.4% drop.
Although there were still signs of a gathering growth momentum in the world’s second largest economy, an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in December saw the re-imposition of lockdowns in the affected areas and worries about temporary disruptions to production.
The outbreak, the country's worst since March 2020, saw measures such as home quarantines and travel curbs imposed to curb the spread of the virus. The disappointing data also reflected the impact of the measures’ impact on both production and services, including logistics and transportation, ahead of the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays.
Other key datasets for January, including those for trade, industrial output and retail sales, will be combined with figures for February and released in March. Investors will therefore have to wait for more datapoints with which to gauge economic health."

The producer price index (PPI) rose 0.3% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement, the fastest pace of increase since May 2019 but slightly lagging a 0.4% gain tipped by a Reuters poll of analysts. PPI declined 0.4% in December.
Consumer prices, however, unexpectedly slipped into deflation in January, the first time upstream prices have risen faster than downstream costs in more than two years.
China's return to factory-gate inflation was driven by increases in upstream raw materials, said Betty Wang, an analyst at ANZ. Over the next months PPI ""may extend the uptrend and rise positively,"" she said.
The country's factories staged a stunning export-driven recovery in 2020 thanks to hot global demand for home electronics and anti-epidemic goods, and as other manufacturing economies struggled with COVID-19 lockdowns.
The economy is expected to grow 8.4% this year, following a 2.3% rise in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that forced the country to shut down for much of the March quarter last year.
But a resurgence of the virus last month, though mostly isolated to the northeastern provinces, raised concerns about temporary disruptions to production.
Some regional authorities rolled out tough measures including home quarantines and travel curbs to contain what was the country's worst outbreak since March 2020. Numbers of new domestically transmitted cases fell sharply by early February.
China's factory activity grew at the slowest pace in five months in January, official data showed last week, reflecting the outbreak's impact on production and transportation as the country sought to contain COVID-19 ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays.
China does not release several key datasets such as trade, industrial output and retail sales for January and instead reports combined January-February numbers in March, leaving markets with fewer data points to assess the health of the economy.
The consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3% in January from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said in a separate statement, compared with no change tipped by the Reuters poll and a 0.2% rise in December.
The slip into deflation was mainly caused by high base effects a year earlier and will likely reverse sharply in February due to Lunar New Year demand, said analysts from Capital Economics in a note. CPI is likely to increase by around 2% by the end of the second quarter, they said.

""That shouldn't alarm the PBOC but will provide reassurance that they are right to focus on controlling credit risks. As such, we think the PBOC will tighten policy this year,"" they said, referring to the People's Bank of China.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>",U.S. job openings rise in December; small businesses desperate for workers,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. layoffs eased in December and job openings increased modestly, suggesting the decline in employment that month was largely due to companies cutting back on hiring amid uncertainty caused by a raging COVID-19 pandemic.
Though the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, offered cautious optimism that job growth could regain speed as coronavirus vaccines become accessible to large swaths of the population, unemployment remains pervasive.
The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months following renewed outbreaks of the virus. 
""The decline in employment in December was more a product of reduced hiring than a pick-up in layoffs,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""Employers were hesitant about adding new workers. This trend is easier to reverse than the destruction of employer-employee relationships that happens when workers are laid off.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, rose 74,000 to 6.65 million on the last day of December from 6.572 million. There were an additional 296,000 job openings in the professional and business services industry. But vacancies decreased for state and local government, excluding education. 
There also were fewer unfilled jobs in the arts, entertainment and recreation industries as well as at factories producing goods that are not intended to last longer than three years, such as clothing. 
The job openings rate ticked up to 4.5% from 4.4% in November. Layoffs decreased by 243,000 to 1.81 million, lowering the layoffs rate to 1.3% from 1.4% in November. Layoffs declined in the federal government, transportation, warehousing and utilities industries as well as the healthcare and social assistance sector.
But 50,000 people were laid off in the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry. 
Hiring dropped by 396,000 to 5.54 million. It was led by a decrease of 221,000 in the accommodation and food services industry. Hiring in the transportation, warehousing, and utilities sector fell by 133,000 and decreased by 82,000 in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry.
But retailers hired 94,000 workers. The hiring rate declined to 3.9% from 4.2% in November. 
U.S. financial markets were unmoved by the data.
WORKER SHORTAGE
The government reported on Friday that the economy created only 49,000 jobs in January after shedding 227,000 jobs in December. Employment is 9.9 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.
The labor market has largely stalled amid a resurgence in COVID-19 infections, which now appears to be ebbing. In December, there were 16 unemployed people for every 10 job openings.
""The January jobs report was a stark reminder that near-term risks remain tilted to the downside amid a third COVID-19 wave,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""But the labor market outlook is slowly brightening. We foresee increased vaccinations, elevated savings and robust business activity contributing to a 6.6 million jobs rebound in 2021."" 
Many economists do not expect the labor market to return to its pre-pandemic peak until 2023. Amid the labor market slack, signs of a skills mismatch are emerging. 
A separate survey from the NFIB on Tuesday showed a third of small businesses reported in January that they had vacancies they could not fill, with 28% of those for skilled workers. 
The dearth of skilled workers was more acute in construction, with 56% of firms reporting few or no qualified applicants, according to the NFIB. Overall, among small businesses hiring or trying to hire, 90% also reported few or no qualified applicants for the positions they were trying to fill.
""The pandemic has undoubtedly made it more difficult for many workers to rejoin the workforce, while the expansion of unemployment benefits has likely also reduced the urgency to return to work,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The JOLTS report also showed the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs rose 106,000 to 3.29 million in December. That lifted the quits rate to 2.3% from 2.2% in November. The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. 

But the pandemic has forced millions of women to drop out of the labor force mostly because of problems related to child care, with many schools still only offering online learning.

Official data released on Monday showed Germany's industrial sector avoided a contraction in December despite coronavirus lockdowns at home and abroad as strong demand from China helped export-oriented manufacturers weather the COVID-19 pandemic.
The German government last month slashed its GDP growth forecast to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%. This means the economy probably won't reach its pre-pandemic level before mid-2022.
Once a role model for fighting the pandemic, Germany has struggled with a second wave. Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders are due to review lockdown measures on Wednesday. Bavaria's premier said on Sunday it was too soon to lift restrictions.

Germany suffered its second-biggest economic plunge in post-war history last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Spending by British consumers plunged in January at the fastest rate in seven months as the country went back into a tight COVID-19 lockdown, payment card firm Barclaycard said on Tuesday.
A 73% annual increase in online retail spending and record demand for takeaway food - which jumped by a third from a year ago - failed to compensate for the closure of many businesses.
Overall consumer spending shrank by 16.3% in year-on-year terms last month, Barclaycard said, the biggest drop since May when the country was starting to emerge from its first lockdown.
Spending in pubs and bars dropped nearly 94% and was down by more than 84% in restaurants, the survey showed. Travel agents also reported an 87% drop in spending during a month when many Britons would normally book summer holidays abroad.
By contrast spending at supermarkets soared by 17% as people prepared more food at home. 
The difference in spending patterns was reflected in a separate survey on Tuesday published by the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body.
It said overall retail spending at major retail chains fell by 1.3% in January compared with the same month last year.
Over the three months to January, food sales were up nearly 8% while non-food sales were down 5.6%.
""The current lockdown has hit non-essential retailers harder than in November, with the new variant hampering consumer confidence and leading customers to hold back on spending – especially on clothing and footwear,"" Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive, said.
Barclaycard said a survey it commissioned showed only 40% of respondents felt secure in their jobs, down from 50% in January last year and the lowest proportion in over a year. 
The survey of 2,001 people was conducted between Jan. 22 and Jan. 25 by Longitude Research, while the card data covered Dec. 25 to Jan. 22. The BRC figures covered Jan. 3 to Jan. 30.

The Bank of England predicts Britain's economy will shrink by 4% in the first three months of 2021, largely due to the new lockdown. But it says pent-up savings among people stuck at home could fuel strong growth later this year when the rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations allows restrictions to be lifted.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 04:05AM ET</span>","Taiwan January exports rocket to record high, outlook rosy","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports rose in January for the seventh consecutive month, with the unexpectedly strong pace setting a new record as its manufacturers benefited from consumers staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and new technologies such as 5G.
Exports jumped 36.8% from a year earlier to $34.27 billion in January, the highest monthly figure on record, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday, though it was helped by a low base with the week-long Lunar New Year holiday falling in January last year.
Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a rise of 15% for last month, compared with a 12% jump in December.
The ministry attributed the growth to demand for chips to help power the ""zero touch economy"" exceeding expectations, as millions of people are forced to work and study remotely on laptops, tablets and other technology.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), for which firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd are major suppliers, launched its next-generation iPhone 12 with faster 5G connectivity in September.
The ministry expected exports to steadily expand in the first quarter, saying vaccines will help the global economy recovery and that Taiwan, with its strong semiconductor industry, stood ready to benefit from the digital economy transformation.
Exports to China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, jumped an annual 57% to $14.85 billion, while exports to the United States grew 21.9% on year.
Taiwan's economy grew at its fastest pace in almost a decade in the fourth quarter after a steep contraction earlier last year, as strong global demand for its tech exports offset the hit from the pandemic.
January imports rose 29.9%, against economists' expectations for a 14.7% jump and a small gain of 0.9% in December.
Taiwan could see February exports rise more modestly in the range of 3% to 8% year on year, the ministry said, with the Lunar New Year holiday taking place in the middle of the month and cutting the number of work days.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's industrial sector avoided a contraction in December despite coronavirus lockdowns at home and abroad as strong demand from China helped export-oriented manufacturers in Europe's largest economy weather the COVID-19 pandemic.
Industrial output was flat on the month after an upwardly revised increase of 1.5% in the previous month, figures released by the Federal Statistics Office showed. A Reuters poll had forecast an increase of 0.3%.
This was the first stagnation following seven consecutive months of expansions.
The main drag came from construction where output fell by 3.2%. Looking at core manufacturing alone, output rose by 0.9% on the month.
The upwardly revised November figure helped overall industrial output in the fourth quarter to increase by 6.1% on the quarter.
""The German manufacturing sector has performed relatively well in recent months and that's mainly thanks to the well-running Chinese economy,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.
""If production in China is humming, local production is also humming here,"" Gitzel said, adding that the German automobile industry with its premium cars was benefiting in particular from the good income situation in China.
DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle also pointed to positive one-off factors in December related to the expiration of a temporary sales tax cut in January and British clients stocking up supplies in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit. 
OUTLOOK CLOUDED
In 2020 as a whole, production in the manufacturing sector tumbled by a calendar-adjusted 8.5% on the year, in further proof of the wider economic devastation caused by the pandemic.
The economy ministry said the outlook for the industrial sector remained subdued given further development of the pandemic and supply bottlenecks in the semiconductor industry. A drop in industrial orders and a decline in business morale were clouding the outlook further, it added.
Data last week showed that orders for German-made goods fell more than expected in December, ending a seven-month streak of positive data as restrictions to contain the coronavirus dragged down demand from other euro zone countries.
This followed a survey by the Ifo economic institute which showed that German business morale slumped to a six-month low in January as a second wave of COVID-19 halted a recovery in the economy.
The Ifo institute expects the German economy to stagnate in the first quarter while the Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) predicts a decline.

The German government last month slashed its GDP growth forecast to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%. This means the economy probably won't reach its pre-pandemic level before mid-2022.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment index worsened for a third straight month in January, hitting its lowest since last May after a state of emergency was reimposed in Tokyo areas and some other prefectures, a Cabinet Office survey showed on Monday.
The survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions declined 3.1 points from December to 31.2.
It was the lowest level since the index hit 17.0 in May 2020, when the economy was reeling from the first wave of the pandemic and suffered its worst post-war slump.
Re-assessing the economy based on the survey's findings, the government said the economy was now weakening, downgrading its view for a third straight month. 
""The number of the coronavirus cases is on the rise. Conditions in the restaurant business, hotels and the tourism industry remain severe,"" a respondent at a financial company in northern Japan said in the survey.
The service sector sentiment outlook index, which indicates the level of confidence in future conditions, rose 3.8 points to 39.9 in January, up for a second straight month. 
The government aims to start COVID-19 vaccinations in mid-February, which should support the economy, some respondents said.

Still, analysts expect Japan's economy is expected to shrink again in the current quarter as renewed restrictions rolled out in January to curb the spread of the coronavirus would further hurt businesses and consumers.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economic growth likely moderated in October-December after rebounding from its worst postwar recession earlier in 2020, a Reuters poll showed, a sign households and companies have yet to recover from the coronavirus pandemic's huge hit.
A state of emergency rolled out in January has inflicted further pain on consumption, stoking fears of another economic slump that could push Japan back into deflation.
Analysts polled by Reuters expect the economy to have marked a quarter-on-quarter expansion of 2.3% in October-December, as improving exports made up for some of the weakness in consumption.
However, that would be much slower than a 5.3% jump in the third quarter, when the lifting of the previous state of emergency helped the economy emerge from its worst postwar slump in the April-June quarter.
""Consumption, especially service spending, will continue to decline while restrictions apply on economic activity,"" said Masato Koike, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""A slump in January-March consumption is unavoidable.""
Underscoring the heavy toll the pandemic took on the fragile economy, the central bank's estimates in January show the economy likely shrank 5.6% in the year ending March.
Japan's October-December gross domestic product (GDP) data, set for release at 8:50 a.m. on Feb. 15 (2350 GMT, Feb. 14), will likely highlight the challenges policymakers face in supporting the economy while preventing the spread of the virus.
On an annualised basis, the economy likely expanded 9.5% in October-December after a 22.9% gain in the previous quarter, the poll showed.

(For an interactive graphic of Japan's quarter-on-quarter GDP growth, click: https://tmsnrt.rs/2MZu5Sl)
Even if the economy rebounds at the estimated pace in the final quarter of last year, it will remain at roughly 80% the level before the pandemic struck in March, analysts say.
Private consumption, which accounts for more than half of the economy, likely rose just 1.8% in October-December after a 5.1% increase in the previous quarter, the poll showed.
Capital spending was projected to have risen 2.6%, which would be the first increase since January-March last year.
External demand - or exports minus imports - likely contributed 1.0 percentage point to October-December GDP growth, according to the poll.

""Brisk overseas demand underpinned exports, while domestic demand got some boost from the government's stimulus measures,"" said Shinichiro Kobayashi, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting. ""But the outlook remains uncertain.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese bank deposits surged at a record annual pace in January, data showed on Monday, a sign companies and households were continuing to hoard cash to guard against the prolonged damage from the coronavirus pandemic.
Total deposits at commercial banks rose a record 9.8% in January from a year earlier to hit 806.2 trillion yen ($7.6 trillion), accelerating from a 9.3% gain in December, according to data released by the Bank of Japan.
Companies were piling up money from subsidies and loans they took up as a precaution against the health crisis, while households were holding back on spending due to the third wave of infections, a BOJ official told reporters.
The pace of growth in bank lending slowed, however, as big borrowers have already amassed precautionary loans to weather the hit from the pandemic.
Outstanding loans held by Japan's four main categories of banks, including ""shinkin"" or credit unions, rose 6.1% in January from a year earlier to hit a record 578.1 trillion yen, the data showed.
""Some small- and medium-sized firms are borrowing more but there doesn't appear to be a huge increase in requests for additional loans. Demand for spending on capital expenditure also remains weak,"" the official said.
The BOJ eased monetary policy twice last year to cushion the economic blow from COVID-19, including by creating a new lending facility aimed at channeling funds to cash-strapped firms via financial institutions.
While lending by cash-strapped firms has peaked, the government's decision to impose new state of emergency curbs from January to prevent the spread of the virus has clouded the outlook for the world's third-largest economy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth rebounded less than expected in January and job losses the prior month were deeper than initially thought, strengthening the argument for additional relief money from the government to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Labor Department said on Friday nonfarm payrolls increased by 49,000 jobs last month. Data for December was revised to show 227,000 jobs lost instead of 140,000 as previously reported. 
December's drop was the first in eight months and came amid renewed restrictions on businesses like restaurants and bars to slow a resurgence in coronavirus infections.
The unemployment rate was at 6.3% in January. The jobless rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 50,000 jobs in January. 
The closely watched employment report underscored the need for additional relief money from the government, with millions of people experiencing long bouts of unemployment and others having permanently lost their jobs, and given up the search for work. Employment is more than 9 million jobs below its peak in February 2020. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024. 

President Joe Biden is pushing the U.S. Congress to pass a $1.9 trillion recovery plan, which has been met with resistance from mostly Republican lawmakers, now worried about the swelling national debt. The Senate worked late into the night on Thursday, with Biden's fellow Democrats aiming to override Republican opposition to the sweeping COVID-19 relief plan.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy added only 49,000 jobs in the month through mid-January, in line with early expectations but well short of the 174,000 reported by private payrolls processor ADP on Wednesday.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised its figures for December to show a net loss of 227,000 jobs, rather than the 140,000 originally reported.
U.S. futures shrugged off the data, Dow Jones Futures losing only 10 points, or less than 0.1%, on the back of the news. 
The data come against the backdrop of still-widespread restrictions on businesses, especially in the services sector, as a result of public health measures to stop the spread of Covid-19. As so often already, the main job losses came in the retail and entertainment sectors. General merchandise stores shed 30,000 jobs, eletronics and appliance stores shed 29,000 and amusement parks and casinos shed 27,000. Employment services, a category that covers sectors such as temporary labor, took up the slack with a gain of 62,000.
The numbers come as something of a reality check at the end of a week when investor optimism has been strengthened by the progress of President Joe Biden's $1.9 stimulus package and the Congressional Budget Office's upward revision to its growth forecasts for this year. 
""Numbers like these should give you pause before taking too seriously the CBO potential GDP estimates,"" said David Beckworth, a senior research fellow with the Mercatus think-tank, via Twitter.
Greg Daco, an analyst with Oxford Economics, added that the numbers still mean that nearly 10 million jobs, on a net basis, have been lost since the start of the pandemic. 
The unemployment rate fell surprisingly to 6.4% from 6.7%, but analysts noted that even this flattered the underlying dynamic, since some 400,000 people had left the labor force during the month.

The 32,298 bankruptcies filed in January across both commercial and non-commercial cases was the lowest since Feb. 2006, Epiq reported.
The onset of the coronavirus pandemic sparked concern that waves of businesses and households would be driven into bankruptcy as health restrictions halted commerce and threw millions out of work.
While some categories of commercial bankruptcy did increase in recent months, the overall trend was in the other direction as federal pandemic relief programs kept companies and families afloat.
That continues, as does optimism about further fiscal aid from the Biden administration and now a possible end to the pandemic from vaccinations, said Chris Kruse, senior vice president of Epiq AACER.
""We continue to expect new filings to grow substantially in the second-half of 2021,"" Kruse said in press release.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday that factory orders increased 1.1% after surging 1.3% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders gaining 0.7% in December. Orders dropped 6.6% year-on-year.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, has been driven by strong demand for goods such as electronics and furniture as 23.7% of the labor force works from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But spending on long-lasting manufactured goods declined for a second straight month in December, government data showed last week. The distribution of vaccines to fight the coronavirus is picking up, which is expected to lift spending on services by summer, and slow the manufacturing momentum.
The Institute for Supply Management reported this week that its index of national factory activity slipped in January.
Unfilled orders at factories fell 0.3% in December. Factory goods orders in December were boosted by strong demand for machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components, as well as primary metals and fabricated metal products.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.7% in December instead of 0.6% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, advanced 0.7%. They were previously reported to have gained 0.5% in December.

The Labor Department said on Thursday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, dropped at a 4.8% annualized rate last quarter. That was the deepest pace of contraction since the second quarter of 1981. 
Data for the third quarter was revised higher to show productivity growing at a 5.1% pace instead of the previously reported 4.6% rate. Productivity rose 2.6% in 2020 compared to 1.7% in 2019. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity declining at a 2.8% rate in the fourth quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, productivity increased at a 2.5% rate.
The coronavirus pandemic has decimated lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which economists say tend to be less productive.
Hours worked rose at a 10.7% rate last quarter. That followed a 37.1% pace in the third quarter.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - rebounded at a 6.8% rate after plunging at a 7.0% rate in the third quarter. Unit labor costs increased at a 5.2% rate from a year ago. They rose 4.3% in 2020 after gaining 1.9% in 2019.
Though labor costs have been distorted by the pandemic's disproportionate impact on lower-wage industries, the rebound supports expectations of higher inflation this year.

Hourly compensation increased at a 1.7% rate last quarter. That followed a 2.2% pace of decline in the July-September quarter. Compensation increased at a 7.8% rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. It grew 7.0% in 2020 after rising 3.6% in 2019.

The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 779,000 last week, and also revised the previous week's figure down to 812,000 from an initial estimate of 847,000. 
The news follows an expectedly strong report on private-sector hiring on Wednesday by ADP. The payrolls processor said that the private sector hired a net 174,000 people in the month through mid-January.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars in the European Union almost trebled to over 1 million vehicles last year, accounting for more than 10% of overall sales, data showed on Thursday.
The jump in sales shows electrified vehicles are becoming more mainstream products after years of being a niche market and it came at a time when overall EU car sales plunged nearly 24% to 9.9 million because of COVID-19 lockdowns.
The data released by the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) showed sales of fully-electric and plug-in hybrids surged to 1.046 million vehicles from 387,808 in 2019.
Sales of self-charging hybrid cars climbed 59% to 1.182 million last year while petrol and diesel vehicle sales fell 37% and 32% respectively, the data showed. Petrol cars remained the biggest seller, however, accounting for 48% of all EU sales.
As well as having to meet stringent new EU carbon emissions targets, carmakers benefited from government subsidies for electric vehicles as part of pandemic recovery programmes, especially in France and Germany.

864,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 04:18PM ET</span>",Brace for Wild Swings in China’s Data Distorted by Lockdowns,"(Bloomberg) -- China watchers are in for a wild ride of economic data in the early months of 2021, giving a largely distorted picture of the recovery from coronavirus shutdowns a year ago.
The world’s second-largest economy was the first to go into lockdown to control virus outbreaks in 2020, leading to an historic contraction in gross domestic product in the first quarter of last year. That means year-on-year comparisons for the main indicators watched by most economists will show surging growth over the next few months.
“Buckle up, is the best advice,” said Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics Ltd. “Year-on-year is going to tell us very little about how things are evolving.”
Economists are lining up alternative comparisons to cope with an issue that will hit other major economies from the Spring. Some are relying on month-on-month data or using 2019 as a base year to avoid annual figures that will flatter the pace of China’s recovery.
Distortions will show up first in data recording industrial production, retail sales and investment. These are usually released monthly, but because of the Lunar New Year holidays -- which fall sometime in the first two months of the year -- China typically combines the release of January and February’s data and publishes them in March.
Because of factory shutdowns last February, even if industrial output in the first two months of this year remained constant from the level in December, the annual growth rate would be 25%, said Adam Wolfe, an economist at London-based Absolute Strategy Research.
The big one to watch will be first-quarter GDP, which is scheduled for release on April 16. It could hit a record 18.1% compared with a year ago, according to a Bloomberg survey economists. Wolfe says “a print above 20% can’t be ruled out, even with the current restrictions on travel for the new year holiday.”
China’s quick suppression of coronavirus means the base effect will fade in quarterly data after March, but the impact on annual growth will remain. If GDP remains at the same level for the whole of 2021 as in the last quarter of 2020, the economy would still register 6.6% average growth for the full year, according to the Institute of International Finance. That is the biggest base effect of any country, reflecting China’s ability to return to pre-pandemic growth levels by the end of last year.
“China had its Covid-19 in the first quarter of 2020, unlike most other countries where the contraction was only in the second quarter,” said IIF Chief Economist Robin Brooks. “That gives a steeply upward sloping profile for China’s GDP in the course of 2020, which means that the statistical carry over is very high.”
The data will pose a challenge to Chinese policy makers, who tend to watch carefully for signs of overheating in the economy. A premature withdrawal of policy support is among the biggest risks to China’s recovery this year, the World Bank has warned.
“Last year’s extremely depressed low base will inevitably make this year’s macro numbers look super strong, which does not necessarily mean that the economy has become overheated,” said Yan Wang, chief China strategist at Alpine Macro.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
While “the year-on-year jump would be a hurdle for market players and policy makers to judge the situation, I think the jump in 1Q data won’t influence the authorities’ policy stance.”
-- David Qu, China economist
Economists are likely to gauge the recovery by comparing with the previous month, the previous quarter, or by taking 2019 as a baseline and calculating average growth over the two years since, said Ding Shuang, chief economist for Greater China at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc in Hong Kong.
Monthly business surveys, like the Purchasing Manager’s Index, may give a better picture of the recovery. Already there are signs of a peaking late last year and a weakening in activity in January due to new travel restrictions to control flare-ups of the coronavirus.

High frequency indicators, like transport data, car sales and cinema box-office income, could also prove useful.
“Monthly changes of high frequency indicators such as industrial production or retail sales will be more indicative,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group (OTC:ANZBY) in Hong Kong. “We should also pay attention to how consumption and passenger traffic fare during the Lunar holidays.”

865,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 12:05PM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls rebound; services industry activity gains steam,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls rebounded more than expected in January, suggesting the labor market recovery was back on track after the economy shed jobs in December as soaring COVID-19 infections hurt operations in the leisure and hospitality industry.
There was also encouraging news on the embattled services sector, with other data on Wednesday showing activity racing to its highest level in nearly two years in January amid an acceleration in new orders and employment. The upbeat reports likely reflected nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government in late December.
If the solid hiring is confirmed in the government's closely watched employment report on Friday, that could complicate President Joe Biden's push for a $1.9 trillion package to speed up the economic recovery, which has met with resistance from some lawmakers worried about the ballooning national debt. 
Authorities have started to ease restrictions on businesses amid signs of a peak in the recent coronavirus wave, though a new strain of the virus has been reported in many states. 
""The rebounds suggest that demand rebounded quickly once the latest coronavirus wave passed its peak,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
The ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 174,000 jobs last month after dropping by 78,000 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would rebound by 49,000 in January. The gains in hiring were broad, though the pace was half of the 347,000 monthly average job growth in the last six months of 2020.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. 
Goods producers added 19,000 jobs in January, with employment in the construction industry rising 18,000. Manufacturing payrolls gained only 1,000. Hiring in the services sector rebounded by 156,000 jobs after falling 73,000 in December. 
The leisure and hospitality industry added 35,000 jobs after shedding 79,000 positions in December.
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 58.7 last month. That was the highest reading since February 2019 and followed 57.7 in December. The index is now above its pre-pandemic level. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 56.8. 
The survey's index of services industry employment rebounded to an 11-month high of 55.2 from 48.7 in December.
SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES
The distribution of vaccines has boosted optimism in the industry hardest hit by the pandemic because of the restrictions on businesses like restaurants and bars. 
Still, the ISM noted that ""various local-and state-level COVID-19 restrictions continue to negatively impact companies and industries,"" and that ""production capacity and logistics issues continue to cause supply chain challenges.""
The pandemic has shifted spending away from services to goods, with consumers staying away from other businesses and venues which attract crowds. 
Consumer spending on services is about 7.5% lower than before the outbreak of the virus in the United States.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry shot up to a six-month high of 61.8 from a reading of 58.6 in December. Backlog orders recovered, though export orders contracted as a global resurgence in the coronavirus led to renewed lockdowns in some of the United States' trade partners. 
""Recovery in payrolls is ongoing, albeit at a slow pace,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. 
The reports were published ahead of the government's closely watched, and comprehensive, monthly employment report on Friday.
Despite the solid ADP number, few economists changed their estimates for January nonfarm payrolls, noting its spotty record predicting the private payrolls count in the government's employment report. 
According to a Reuters poll of economists payrolls likely increased by 50,000 jobs in January after declining by 140,000 in December, the first drop in employment in eight months.
Expectations for a rebound in hiring were bolstered by a report on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management showing that manufacturers hired more workers in January, though a flare-up in COVID-19 infections caused labor shortages at factories and their suppliers.
But the Conference Board's survey last week showed consumers' perceptions of labor market conditions deteriorated further in January.
""We project that payrolls rose by 100,000 in January but the margin of error associated with this forecast still suggests a decline in jobs is a significant possibility,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.

The economy has recouped 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Monday that employment would not return to its pre-pandemic level before 2024.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat estimated that consumer prices in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.2% month-on-month in January for a 0.9% year-on-year jump, rebounding from a 0.3% year-on-year fall in December.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.5% year-on-year rise in January.
Volatile energy prices rose 3.8% month-on-month in January, Eurostat estimated, but were still 4.1% lower than a year earlier, while also volatile unprocessed food prices went up 1.1% on the month and 1.9% year-on-year.
The measure excluding these two volatile components, which the European Central Bank calls core inflation and follows closely in policy decisions, still eased 0.3% on the month, but rose 1.4% on the year. 
An even narrower measure excluding also alcohol and tobacco prices that are often subject to changes because governments raise excise tax on them, fell 0.5% on the month but was also 1.4% higher than in the same period of 2020, far higher than expected
This is likely to be welcome news for the European Central Bank, which wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2% percent but has been missing that target for years despite ultra low interest rates and buying hundreds of billions of euros in government bonds to inject liquidity into the banking system.
The faster consumer price growth in January was mainly visible in the biggest economy Germany, where prices went up 1.6% on the year, and in the Netherlands, where they rose 1.7% year-on-year.
Separately, Eurostat said prices at factory gates rose more than expected, at 0.8% in December against November for a -1.1% year-on-year fall. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7% monthly increase and a -1.2% annual decline. 

Producer prices give an early indication of consumer inflation trends because changes to prices at factory gates are most often passed on to the final consumer.

The final version of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) - spanning services businesses and manufacturers - fell to 41.2 in January from 50.4 in December, far below the growth threshold of 50.0.
This was the index's lowest reading since May. But it was up slightly from a preliminary reading of 40.6 for January and was nothing like as weak as during Britain's first lockdown last spring when it slumped to 13.8.
The fast rollout of COVID-19 vaccinations in Britain helped to push optimism among services firms to its highest since May 2014, in contrast to falling confidence in the euro zone, where vaccinations have been slow.
The Bank of England is expected to hold off from pumping more stimulus into the economy on Thursday as it waits for the lockdowns across Britain to be eased in the spring.
""While the UK economy is on course to contract sharply during the first quarter of 2021, businesses remain confident that pent-up demand and an easing of pandemic restrictions will provide a springboard to recovery later this year,"" Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said.
The PMI for the services industry alone, which accounts for the bulk of Britain's private-sector economy, fell to 39.5 in January from 49.4 in December, its lowest since May and marking a third month of contraction.

Companies mostly cited the hit from COVID-19 international travel restrictions on export sales but some said Brexit pushed down orders from clients in the European Union.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic downturn deepened in January as renewed restrictions to quell the spread of the coronavirus hit the bloc's dominant service industry hard, a survey showed.
Coronavirus cases have been soaring again and governments across the continent have renewed tough lockdown measures, clamping down on public life and forcing hospitality and entertainment venues to close their doors.
IHS Markit's final January Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good guide to economic health, fell to 47.8 from December's 49.1 but was a touch above a flash reading of 47.5. Anything below 50 indicates contraction.
""The euro zone economy endured a predictably tough start to 2021 as ongoing efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 continued to hit business activity, especially in the service sector,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.

""Manufacturing growth continued to help offset some of the weakness in the service sector, though even here factories saw output growth slow amid subdued demand and supply delays, often linked to the pandemic,"" Williamson said.
""A contraction of GDP therefore looks likely in the first quarter, though on current trends this should be modest in comparison to the falls seen in the first half of 2020."" 
The bloc's economy contracted 0.7% last quarter, official data showed on Tuesday, and a January Reuters poll predicted it would take up to two years for the economy to return to pre-COVID-19 levels.[ECILT/EU]
With venues closed, demand for services unsurprisingly fell. The new business index dropped to 45.4 from 46.6, albeit ahead of the 44.7 flash estimate.

But amid hopes the vaccines being rolled out would allow for some return to normality, overall optimism about the year ahead remained resilient. The composite future output index only nudged down to 64.2 from December's 64.5, which was the highest since April 2018.

Investing.com – China’s services sector grew at slowest pace in nine months in January, according to a private sector survey, as an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country impacted consumer sentiment.
January’s Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier in the day, was 52 and remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion. In comparison, December’s figure was 56.3.
A sub-index for employment came in at 50.7, the lowest since July 2020 and down from December's 52 figure. New export business growth, which had only returned to expansion in November 2020, slowed from the previous month.
The data was largely in line with disappointing economic data released earlier in the week, and further suggests a slowdown in China’s economic recovery.
The Caixin manufacturing PMI was 51.5, with the manufacturing PMI at 51.3 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 52.4 respectively.
The services sector survey also showed that although input prices continued to rise, the rise in prices charged by services firms slowed. The sector has seen a slower recovery from the impact of COVID-19 than the industrial sector, as it is more vulnerable to restrictive measures, such as lockdowns, imposed to curb COVID-19 outbreaks.
“The services sector’s post-epidemic recovery continued, but at a much slower pace. Some surveyed enterprises said the services market continued to recover, while many said the market had been hurt by the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
A recent outbreak of COVID-19 cases in northern China was the worst seen since March 2020, with local lockdowns imposed in January to curb the spread of the virus. The number of cases has dropped over the past few days, however travel over the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays has been discouraged.
Although Chinese service firm remain positive about their 2021 prospects, business expectations over the next 12 months dropped to their lowest levels in four months."

The Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (SHIBOR) for the one-week tenor, the Chinese yuan equivalent of Libor, fell to 2.241%, the lowest level since Jan. 18, compared with a near six-year high of 3.194% in previous session.
The volume-weighted average rate of benchmark seven-day repo traded in the interbank market dropped to a two-week low of 2.2285% at midday, compared with the previous close of 3.1656%.
Short-term funding cost in China started to pick up earlier last week as the central bank refrained from making its usual substantial liquidity injections to meet high demand for cash ahead of the week-long Lunar New Year holidays, which starts on Feb. 11 this year.
Due to coronavirus fears, authorities are seeking to discourage people from travelling or visiting too many friends and relatives during the break, which should lessen demand for cash this year.
Some analysts say this is one of the reasons why there has been no reduction in the banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) ahead of the holiday this year. The other reasons include a desire to avoid creating excess liquidity that could fuel potential bubbles in the property and share markets.
On Tuesday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) injected a net 78 billion yuan ($12.07 billion) into money markets through open market operations, bringing total net injection to 176 billion yuan so far this week. But it drained a total of 216.5 billion yuan in January. [CN/MMT]
Yuan borrowing also declined in Hong Kong. The CNH Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate benchmark (CNH HIBOR) for overnight tenor fell to 2.34183%, down from 3.64591% on Monday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The euro zone economy contracted less than expected in the fourth quarter of 2020 amid pandemic-induced lockdowns, initial EU estimates showed on Tuesday, but it is heading for another, probably steeper decline in the first quarter of this year.
The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said that according to its preliminary flash estimate, gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell by 0.7% quarter-on-quarter, for a 5.1% year-on-year decline.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.0% quarterly fall and a 5.4% annual contraction after a sharp rebound in the July-September period when the euro zone eased restrictions on travel and leisure after a first wave of COVID-19 cases.
""In the first quarter of 2021, the decline is likely to be somewhat steeper. However, there will not be a slump like the one in the first half of 2020. Instead, a noticeable recovery is likely to set in again from the spring,"" said Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
Eurostat preliminary data showed the second and third largest euro zone economies, France and Italy, pulled down the overall result with quarterly GDP declines of 1.3% and 2.0% respectively. Meanwhile Germany inched up 0.1% from the third quarter and Spain grew 0.4%.
Economists said the fourth quarter slump was milder than in the first half of the year because restrictive measures have been adapted and were less severe than earlier.
""Think of countries like France and Spain, for example, where industry and construction have remained largely open over the course of the quarter. This has had a very positive effect on GDP, especially because demand for goods and construction has remained strong despite lockdowns in place,"" said Bert Colijn, economist at ING.
""Mobility, the movement of people which was largely correlated to GDP growth in the first wave, was also stronger in the fourth quarter than during the first wave, which also supported economic activity,"" he said. ""What also helps is that the rest of the world is still open.""
Eurostat said that, according to its first estimation of annual growth for 2020, based on seasonally and calendar adjusted quarterly data, GDP fell by 6.8% in the euro area and 6.4% in the 27-nation European Union.

Eurostat said this was the deepest annual contraction since the series started in 1995. Even in 2009, following 2008 crisis, the contraction was only a 4.3% decline, Eurostat said.

House prices fell by a monthly 0.3%, slowing the pace of their annual increase to 6.4% from 7.3% in December, which was their biggest jump in six years.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected a monthly increase of 0.3% and a 6.9% rise in annual terms.
""To a large extent, the slowdown probably reflects a tapering of demand ahead of the end of the stamp duty holiday, which prompted many people considering a house move to bring forward their purchase,"" Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said.
""If the stamp duty holiday ends as scheduled, and labour market conditions continue to weaken as most analysts expect, housing market activity is likely to slow, perhaps sharply, in the coming months.""
Demand for housing surged after Britain's first coronavirus lockdown last year, helped in part by the temporary exemption of property purchase taxes as well as people seeking bigger homes in response to the lockdown restrictions.
On Monday, data from the Bank of England showed British mortgage approvals remained close to a 13-year high in December.

British media have reported that finance minister Rishi Sunak might extend the tax break and support for the labour market as he seeks to help the economy through the COVID-19 pandemic.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. house prices will continue to race ahead over the next two years, according to a Reuters poll of analysts who said any COVID-19 resurgence was unlikely to knock housing market activity off its current upward course. 
Last year, most of the world's largest economies were brought to their knees by the pandemic but record low interest rates and pent-up demand for homes pushed U.S. house prices to levels not seen in more than half a decade. 
Despite the U.S. economy on average contracting last year at its sharpest pace since the Second World War, it had little bearing on housing market activity, an immunity the sector was expected to carry this year. 
The Jan. 12-Feb. 1 poll of nearly 40 housing analysts forecast the U.S. Case-Shiller house price index to rise 5.7% this year and 4.6% in 2022, the highest since polling began for both periods.
""The U.S. housing market will continue to expand this year, perhaps at a little slower rate than recently as some of the pent up demand has been exhausted, but overall it should be a fairly good year,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
(Reuters poll graphic on the U.S. house prices outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xklvylrlrpg/Reuters%20Poll%20-%20US%20house%20prices%20-%20Jan%202021.png)
A majority, 19 of 34 analysts who answered an additional question, said U.S. housing market activity this year was likely to accelerate. The other 15 said it would slow.
While renewed restrictions to curb a resurgence of infections has weighed on the near-term U.S. economic outlook, over 85% of analysts, or 30 of 35, said the risk of COVID-19 derailing the housing market in 2021 was either low or very low.[ECILT/US] 
Asked what would drive demand for housing this year, 12 of 35 analysts said an economic recovery and 10 respondents picked a desire for more living space. Among the rest, seven chose easy monetary policy and six said a successful vaccine rollout. 
""Two factors here: exceedingly easy monetary policy and changes in tastes and preferences away from crowded cities in favor of areas with lower population density. This will likely continue for all of 2021,"" said Troy Ludtka, U.S. economist at Natixis.

Although strong demand has led to higher home prices, a shortage of supply was squeezed further with inventory levels falling to a third of what is viewed as healthy. After existing home sales touched nearly 7.0 million units last October - the highest since November 2005 - home builders ramped up construction activity to try and match demand.
Both housing starts and building permits are at levels not seen since the previous housing boom well over a decade ago. Existing home sales were forecast to drop but stay elevated and average around 6.0 million units this year. 
Strong demand at a time of a supply squeeze has pushed prices up, and when asked to rate U.S. housing affordability on a scale of 1 to 10 - where one was cheap and 10 expensive - analysts rated it 7. 
""It's not just very strong demand but also record low supply of existing and new homes that's driving rapid price increases ... that will eventually, if it continued, erode affordability,"" said BMO's Guatieri.

876,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity cools amid COVID-19 flare-up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. manufacturing activity slowed slightly in January, while a measure of prices paid by factories for raw materials and other inputs jumped to its highest level in nearly 10 years, strengthening expectations inflation will perk up this year.
The moderation in activity reported by the Institute for Supply Management on Monday reflected a flare-up in COVID-19 infections, causing labor shortages in factories and their suppliers, which the ISM said ""will continue to restrict the manufacturing economy expansion until the coronavirus crisis abates."" Manufacturing and housing are anchoring the economic recovery from the pandemic.
""It's another reminder, not that we need one, the vaccine rollout has a long way to go before COVID loses its place as the biggest risk to economic growth,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. 
The ISM's index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.5 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 60 in January. 
The ISM revised data going back to 2012. Sixteen industries, including electrical equipment, appliances and components, machinery, primary metals and chemical products expanded in January. Printing and related support activities, and petroleum and coal products industries contracted.
Manufacturing has been driven by strong demand for goods like electronics and furniture as 23.7% of the labor force works from home because of the coronavirus outbreak. But spending on long-lasting manufactured goods fell for a second straight month in December, government data showed on Friday.
With the distribution of vaccines to fight the coronavirus expected to broaden and accelerate, spending on services is likely to pick up by summer. That could cause a slowdown in manufacturing activity from current levels. Still, a contraction is unlikely as customer inventories fell to an 11-year low in January. Factory stocks are also very lean.
A separate report on Monday from the Commerce Department said construction spending increased 1.0% to $1.490 trillion, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002. That followed a 1.1% jump in November.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher following a sharp sell-off last week. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
SUPPLY SQUEEZE
Manufacturers mostly described demand as strong last month, but worried about labor and input supply constraints. Makers of computer and electronic products said ""increased demand, labor constraints and upstream supply delays are pushing lead times.""
Food producers reported that ""labor continues to be one of our largest challenges."" Machinery manufacturers complained about ""significant cost increases in logistics and raw materials."" Makers of miscellaneous goods reported ""an increase in employees testing positive for COVID-19, negatively impacting manufacturing.""
A separate survey from data firm IHS Markit showed strong manufacturing activity in January and rising supply constraints. 
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to a reading of 61.1 last month from 67.5 in December. Export orders at factories also moderated. Despite the cool-off in orders, factories increased hiring last month. 
The survey's manufacturing employment gauge rose to 52.6 from 51.7 in December. That raises hope for a rebound in hiring this month after the economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the government's employment report on Friday is likely to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 50,000 jobs in January.
Job losses have been disproportionately in the services industry.
""The structural mismatch between those who are out-of-work, primarily service workers, and those looking to hire, manufacturers, is a key reason why our forecast shows a more gradual jobs recovery than an otherwise robust rebound in output would suggest,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Bottlenecks in the supply chain worsened, with suppliers struggling to meet factory needs. That drove costs for manufacturers even higher. The survey's prices paid index jumped to a reading of 82.1 last month, the highest since April 2011, from 77.6 in December. Coming in the wake of recent data showing a rise in consumer prices and labor costs, it supports predictions of a pickup in inflation in the coming months.

""It could be interpreted as a sign that inflation pressures are becoming a broader issue for the economy,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""While we think it is too early to be especially concerned, we do predict that headline inflation will rise above 3% and core inflation above 2.5% in coming quarters.""
But high unemployment could limit manufacturers' ability to raise prices. Employment is still 10 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak.

JANTETELCO, Mexico (Reuters) - Alberto Burgos is one of thousands of Mexican migrants living in the United States who dug deep and sent extra money to family back home last year to alleviate the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
    Growing plants and helping to handle their sale at a huge nursery in Alabama, the 35-year-old dipped into savings to transfer about a third more to his home town in central Mexico than he did in 2019, he said in an interview.
Burgos is one of a growing number of Mexicans with U.S. work permits or access to benefits who helped to fuel a more than 10% jump in remittances to Mexico last year to more than $40 billion, even as money transfers to other countries tumbled.
The record remittances have made Burgos' home town of Jantetelco - which has sent many economic migrants to work in U.S. nurseries and elsewhere - an oasis of relative prosperity despite the worst recession to batter Mexico since the 1930s.
""Returning to Mexico made me very sad this time: it's hard to see people with nothing,"" Burgos said. ""Thank God I was able to support them because I didn't lose my job.""
Because of a surge in demand for flowers from Americans trying to brighten up their homes and enjoy gardening during lockdown, Burgos had about nine months of work in the United States last year, three months more than usual, he said. 
    The pandemic shaved 8.5% off Mexican gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, but remittances softened the blow, helping Jantetelco residents to repair their homes and even cover private medical bills sparked by the strain on public hospitals.
Last year, total remittances to Mexico were equivalent to about 3.8% of GDP, according to calculations by economists including Jonathan Heath, a board member of Mexico's central bank. Over 95% come from the United States, official data show.
The volume underlines Mexico's reliance on the United States even as former President Donald Trump attempted to shut down migration with a border wall and threats of trade sanctions.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has hailed the migrants as ""heroes"" but Mexico's dependence on their money shows the difficulty he has had in delivering on his pledge to create economic conditions that render migration unnecessary.
MEXICAN EXCEPTIONALISM
Helping to fuel remittances is greater access to social security among Mexicans in the United States, 60% of whom have lived there for at least 20 years, according to data from Washington-based think tank the Migration Policy Institute.
Since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the percentage of Mexican migrants with U.S. citizenship has risen significantly, said Jesus Cervantes, a remittance expert at the Centro de Estudios Monetarios Latinoamericanos (CEMLA) research institute.
Over the past decade, the number of Mexican-born people registered in the United States has declined slightly. But the proportion of those holding U.S. citizenship rose by nearly a third to 37% of the total, according to the IPUMS USA database, based on an annual U.S. survey.
That, Cervantes said, made remittances to Mexico ""more resilient"" than they have been to other countries.
Global transfers to Latin America as a whole likely fell by around 20%, and declined by 13-22% to countries across Asia, according to an annual report by bank BBVA (MC:BBVA).
Much of the money captured in Mexico last year went into healthcare and housing, experts say.
In Jantetelco, some two hours' drive southeast of Mexico City, 78-year-old Maria Elena Sandoval said she saved her foot from thrombosis thanks to private surgery paid for by money from a son living in the United States.
Burgos asked Reuters not to reveal how much money he was sending back via  Western Union  (NYSE:WU) lest it encourage criminals to target his family, a risk in Mexico.
A municipality of about 18,000 inhabitants, Jantetelco took in about 25% more in remittances between January and September than in the same period in 2019, according to central bank data.
In the third quarter, that equated to about $425 per person - or to almost two months' worth of Mexico's daily minimum wage.
""Thank God and thank my son they didn't cut off my foot,"" said Sandoval, a grandmother who said she spent the equivalent of $600 on medical treatment to save her limb.
Other Jantetelco residents said they have used remittances to pay for everything from construction and renovation of homes damaged by a 2017 earthquake, new cars, appliances and crop seeds, to coming-of-age parties.
Mexico's leaders have traditionally tended not to draw attention to the money, given the often murky U.S. migration status of many people supporting families in Mexico.
But Lopez Obrador has repeatedly celebrated their contributions, and welcomed U.S. President Joe Biden's bid to implement a reform that would settle the migration status of many Mexicans living in the United States.

""You're vulnerable on remittances,"" said Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) economist Carlos Capistran, ""because it's income the country doesn't control.""

878,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>",U.S. construction spending hits record high in December,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending raced to a record high in December as historically low mortgage rates powered outlays on private projects.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending increased 1.0% to $1.490 trillion, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002. Data for November was revised higher to show construction outlays surging 1.1% instead of 0.9% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would increase 0.9% in December. Construction spending rose 5.7% on a year-on-year basis in December. Construction spending, which accounts for about 4% of gross domestic product, advanced 4.7% in 2020.
Spending on private construction projects rose 1.2%, boosted by investment in single-family homebuilding amid cheaper mortgages and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low-density areas. That followed a 1.5% jump in November.
Spending on residential projects shot up 3.1% after increasing 3.0% in November. But outlays on nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 1.7% in December. Still, spending on nonresidential structures rebounded in the fourth quarter after four straight quarterly declines.

Spending on public construction projects gained 0.5%. State and local government outlays rose 0.4%, while federal government spending increased 1.3%.

879,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 10:15AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing sector slows; prices paid by factories highest since 2011 - ISM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity slowed slightly in January, while a measure of prices paid by factories for raw materials and other inputs jumped to its highest level in nearly 10 years, strengthening expectations inflation will perk up this year. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 58.7 last month from 60.5 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index at 60 in January. The ISM revised data going back to 2012.
Manufacturing has been driven by strong demand for goods, like electronics and furniture as 23.7% of the labor force works from home because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But spending on long-lasting manufactured goods fell for a second straight month in December, government data showed on Friday.
With the distribution of vaccines to fight the coronavirus expected to broaden and accelerate, spending on services is likely to pickup by summer. That could see a slowdown in manufacturing activity from current levels. 
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to a reading of 61.1 last month from 67.5 in December. Factories also saw a moderation in export orders. Despite the cool off in orders, factories increased hiring last month. 
The survey's manufacturing employment gauge rose to 52.6 from 51.7 in December. That raises hope for a rebound in hiring this month after the economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. 
But bottlenecks in the supply chain continued driving up costs for manufacturers. The survey's prices paid index jumped to a reading of 82.1 last month, the highest since April 2011, from 77.6 in December. 

That supports predictions of a pick-up in inflation in the coming months, though high unemployment could limit manufacturers' ability to raise prices. Employment is still 10 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global manufacturing activity remained resilient in January although some countries suffered amid a resurgence in coronavirus infections, underscoring the fragile and uneven nature of the economic recovery.
Factories across parts of Europe, as well as in China and Japan, struggled as renewed lockdown measures alongside supply shortages hurt activity, surveys showed.
With coronavirus infections soaring again countries have forced vast swathes of their service industries to shut their doors, leaving manufacturing to support economies as factories have largely remained open.
""In general manufacturing is doing okay. You see some supply side constraints coming through but production and new orders are still growing quite strongly,"" said Claus Vistesen at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""Manufacturing is still offering support and it will continue to do so.""
In the euro zone, IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.8 in January from December's 55.2, although that was a touch above the initial 54.7 ""flash"" estimate. A reading above 50 indicates growth. [EUR/PMIM]
A gauge of British manufacturing growth was at its slowest in three months in January as the combined impact of COVID-19 and Brexit weighed on new export orders and there were signs of disruption of supply chains. [GB/PMIM]
Factories in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, had been humming along during the pandemic on higher demand from abroad but also suffered from increasing supply delays and another hard lockdown.
But in other parts of Europe activity accelerated, with France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and some countries in the east of the continent recording stronger numbers.
ASIAN STRAIN
Factory activity quickened in major chip exporters South Korea and Taiwan, as they benefited from continued brisk demand for semiconductors crucial to work-from-home IT goods.
But China's manufacturing activity expanded at the slowest pace in seven months in January, weighed down by falling export orders.
Japan also saw factory activity slip back into contraction as a new state of emergency hit operating conditions.
""PMI readings for Asia suggest that manufacturing sectors improved further in most places. Buoyant global demand for electronics should continue to support the sector for at least the next few months,"" said Alex Holmes, emerging Asia economist at Capital Economics.
Takeshi Okuwaki, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo, said Japanese manufacturers may slash output as the state of emergency will unavoidably hurt the economy.
""A shortage of chip supply will take time to fix, which will also weigh on Japan's automobile production,"" he said.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing PMI dropped to 51.5 in January, its lowest level since June last year and broadly aligned with Beijing's official PMI, which showed the recovery in factory activity slowing as local COVID-19 cases rose.
That was in stark contrast to South Korea, where factory activity rose at its fastest pace in a decade thanks to soaring exports.
Separate data showed South Korea's exports jumped 11.4% in January from a year earlier to mark a third straight month of gains due in part to surging sales of memory chips.
In India, factory activity expanded at its strongest pace in three months, fuelled by a continued recovery in demand and output.
Manufacturing activity in Indonesia increased at a faster pace and activity stopped contracting in the Philippines but shrank in Malaysia and rose at a slower pace in Vietnam, PMI data showed.
China's economy expanded a faster-than-expected 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year, as factories raced to fill overseas orders.

But recovery hopes are being dampened by a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases as authorities impose lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus in the country's north.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers suffered a double hit last month as COVID-19 disruption to global shipping combined with new trade barriers with the European Union, according to a survey published on Monday.
Separate data from the Bank of England showed a record fall in borrowing by consumers in December, potentially paving the way for a spending rebound once the pandemic eases.
But for now the data paints a picture of a British economy that is struggling in early 2021 as finance minister Rishi Sunak considers whether to extend his emergency support programmes.
Data firm IHS Markit said its monthly survey of the factory sector showed a hit to new export orders, signs of supply chain problems and inflation pressure.
Fhaheen Khan, an economist at Make UK, a manufacturing lobby group, said the worst of the supply chain challenges were yet to come as many manufacturers were still working down stockpiles.
""The impact of both COVID-19 and leaving the EU could linger for many years to come,"" he said. 
The final IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 54.1, below the level in the euro zone and down from a three-year high of 57.5 in December, when factories rushed to beat problems when Britain's new trade relationship with the EU began on Jan. 1.
Smaller manufacturers were the hardest hit.
Britain's fast COVID-19 vaccination programme and progress by companies in adapting to Brexit held out the prospect of a pick-up in the pace of growth but there was no swift end to the headwinds in sight, Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said.
Input price inflation rose to a four-year high, reflecting raw material shortages and transport delays, leading to the steepest inflation of selling prices for 28 months.
Monday's data from the BoE showed unsecured lending to consumers was 7.5% lower in December than a year earlier, the biggest decline since monthly records began in 1994.
""With households paying down debt now, they should be in a good position to start spending again once the COVID-19 restrictions are eventually lifted,"" Ruth Gregory, an economist with Capital Economics, said.
But Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said many households were likely to buy foreign holidays and imported items such as new cars which would not boost economic output.
The BoE data also showed mortgage approvals slipped back slightly in December but remained close to a 13 year-high.

Tombs said the housing market rebound would lose steam before the scheduled March 31 expiry of Sunak's tax cut for property purchases.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 05:05AM ET</span>",Euro zone Dec unemployment stable at 8.3% as expected,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone unemployment was stable at 8.3% of the workforce in December, the European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Monday, despite continued coronavirus lockdowns in most euro zone countries.
Still, Eurostat said 13.671 million people were out of work in the 19 countries sharing the euro in December, up from 13.616 million in November.
In Belgium, Ireland, Cyprus, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal and Slovakia the number of people unemployed actually fell in December, but it rose slightly in other countries, such as Germany, France and Italy.

To keep unemployment levels down during the pandemic, euro zone countries have been using furlough systems where governments subsidise a portion of wages to help employers keep staff on their payrolls. This prevents layoffs and means production capacity can more easily rebound.

883,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 04:35AM ET</span>",Germany's stricter lockdown sinks retail sales in December,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales plunged more than expected in December as a decision to tighten lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19 choked consumer spending in Europe's largest economy at the end of the year, data showed on Monday.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state premiers closed most shops and services from mid-December after a partial lockdown for bars, restaurants and entertainment venues introduced in early November failed to push down infections.
The stricter lockdown, which included schools and kindergartens but excluded factories and offices, has been extended until mid-February.
The Federal Statistics Office said retail sales fell by an unprecedented 9.6% on the month in real terms after a downwardly revised increase of 1.1% in November.
This undershot a Reuters forecast for a drop of 2.6% and marked the steepest monthly drop since records began in 1994, the office said. December is usually the best month for German retailers.
""The containment measures left massive scars in December. Compared to November, sales dropped by an alarming extent,"" VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel said.
On the year, retail sales - a notoriously volatile indicator often subject to revisions - rose 1.5% in real terms following a downwardly revised increase of 5% in November.
ONLINE SALES BENEFIT
For 2020 as a whole, retail sales jumped by 3.9% on the year in real terms, the office said. That was slightly below a previous estimate of 4.1% but still marked the highest annual increase on record.
Online retailers continued to benefit from shifting consumer habits with a strong jump in sales. That came at the expense of clothing and shoe stores ,which continued to suffer.
The HDE retail association has warned that up to 50,000 shops are facing bankruptcy because of the lockdown and the broader shift towards online retailing.
The weaker-than-expect retail sales data followed a consumer sentiment survey by GfK research group last week, which showed that German consumer morale fell a fourth month in a row heading into February as the stricter lockdown kept people from going shopping.
The Ifo economic institute said on Monday that the number of workers on reduced hours as part of the 'Kurzarbeit' job protection scheme rose by almost 20% to 2.6 million in January as a result of the stricter lockdown.
Germany's uneven lockdown has created a two-speed economy in which export-oriented manufacturers are doing well while domestically driven services are suffering.
""Since the lockdown is likely to continue for some time, a significant improvement cannot be expected for the time being,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) economist Ralph Solveen said, adding the economy was likely to shrink significantly in the first quarter of 2021.
Robust exports and construction activity helped the economy eke out 0.1% growth in the final quarter of last year despite the phased lockdown.

A survey by IHS Markit among purchasing managers showed on Monday that increasing supply delays threaten to slow Germany's manufacturing. It nonetheless remained in growth territory in January despite the harder lockdown.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone manufacturing growth remained resilient at the start of the year but the pace waned from December as renewed lockdown measures across the continent, alongside supply shortages, hurt activity, a survey showed.
With coronavirus infections soaring again in Europe countries have forced vast swathes of the bloc's dominant service industry to shut their doors, leaving manufacturing to support the economy as factories have largely remained open.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 54.8 in January from December's 55.2, although that was a touch above the initial 54.7 ""flash"" estimate.
""Euro zone manufacturing output continued to expand at a solid pace at the start of 2021, though growth has weakened to the lowest since the recovery began as new lockdown measures and supply shortages pose further challenges to producers across the region,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good gauge of economic health fell to 54.6 from 56.3, still comfortably above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
But with much of the service industry likely to remain closed for some time the bloc's economic outlook remains bleak and it will take up to two years for GDP to reach pre-COVID-19 levels, a Reuters poll found last month. [ECILT/EU]
Restrictions meant a sub index measuring delivery times sank to 31.6 from 34.4, suggesting factories were struggling to obtain the raw materials they need. The index has only been lower once since the survey began in mid-1997 and that was at the height of the pandemic last year.
""Supply shortages have meanwhile put pricing power in the hands of suppliers, pushing raw material prices sharply higher. Increased shipping costs are adding to the burden,"" Williamson said.
Despite rocketing input costs factories increased their own prices at a shallower rate than in December.

Still, with hopes the vaccines being rolled out will allow some return to normality, optimism about the year ahead climbed to a three-year high.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index rose to 51.6 in January from 51.1 in December, reaching the highest level since last July.
The result was also marginally better than a preliminary reading of 51.5 and brought the index further from the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
""January's PMI results were emblematic of the current situation with COVID-19 as demand conditions began to improve amid expectations of a recovery, while output remained subdued because of ongoing restrictions designed to stem the spread of the virus,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
Manufacturing activity has picked up since slipping in November when France was under its second coronavirus lockdown, which hit the bigger service sector harder because many restaurants, non-essential retail outlets and hotels were forced to close while factories remained operational.

After restrictions were eased in December, France was on tenterhooks through much of January on speculation that a new third lockdown would be imposed.

Investing.com – China's economic recovery hit a block on the road in January, with factory activity expanding at the slowest pace in seven months as falling export orders and resurgent COVID-19 cases dampened sentiment.
The disappointing economic data also highlighted the fragility of China’s recovery from the virus, with a resurgent number of COVID-19 cases reported in the country and a re-navigation of relations with the U.S. as the Biden administration took office.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) was 51.5, lower than the 52.7 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and December’s reading of 53. The Caixin services PMI is due later in the week.
The Caixin survey follows disappointing official data released on Sunday. The manufacturing PMI for January was 51.3, against the 51.6 in forecasts and December’s 51.9 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was 52.4, against December’s 55.7.
Exports ended a five-month growth streak, re-entering contraction territory in January as surging numbers of COVID-19 cases globally saw reduced overseas demand.
China reported a larger-than-expected 6.5% growth in GDP for the fourth quarter of 2020, which was boosted by the surprising resilience in exports as factories scrambled to fulfil overseas orders as the number of global COVID-19 cases climbed.
However, a resurgent number of COVID-19 cases in the country’s northeast saw the reintroduction of restrictive measures such as lockdowns, impacting both production and consumer confidence.
“The gauge for future output expectations was the lowest since May last year though it remained in positive territory, showing manufacturing entrepreneurs were still worried about the sustainability of the economic recovery,” Caixin Insight Group Senior Economist Wang Zhe told Reuters.
“In addition, the weakening job market and the sharp increase in inflationary pressure should not be ignored,” the economist added, with factories continuing to reduce headcount at a faster rate in January.
Average input costs continued a sharp rise in January, with inflation rates only slightly easing from the three-year high reported in December. Increased raw material prices and supplier shortages also continued to soaring prices, according to the Caixin survey.
Logistical delays as the restrictive measures impacted supply chains also increased suppliers’ delivery times, the survey added."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's home prices are expected to rise at a slower pace this year while sales will likely remain steady, as Beijing shifts its focus to tackling rising debt risks in the sector as the economy recovers, a Reuters poll showed.
The residential property market recovered quickly in 2020 benefiting from lower mortgage interest rates and a marginal relaxation of some official curbs on buyers, offering much-needed support for an economy nearly fully recovered to pre-coronavirus levels. But the rebound has raised concerns about financial risk and policymakers have since then tightened screws on the funnelling of funds into the sector.
Average residential property price growth is estimated to cool to 3.3% in 2021, according to 13 analysts and economists surveyed from Jan. 25-29.
Home prices climbed around 4.9% in 2020, a Reuters calculation of official data showed.
The price rises this year will continue to be driven by bigger cities as the credit liquidity released during the COVID-19 epidemic cannot be recalled in the short term, said Nie Wen, economist at Hwabao Trust.
Sluggish demand in smaller cities and stringent lending regulations for developers and buyers, however, will put a lid on any spurt in demand this year, analysts say.
Property transactions are expected to be flat from last year, versus a 2.6% gain in 2020.
Zhao Ke, analyst at China Merchants Securities, said pent-up buying in the second half of 2020 could mean that demand won't be as strong this year.
Yuan Hao, chief real estate analyst with SWS Research also expected the central bank's tight controls on banks' property loan issuance to curb home transactions this year.
Regulators outlined borrowing caps known as ""the three red lines"" last August, while the central bank in December introduced caps on property loans granted by banks.
Major Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen also recently ramped up transaction restrictions and launched probes into illegal flows of funds into the real estate sector.
Housing investments are estimated to rise 6.4% this year, slightly softer than the pace of 7% in 2020.
""The volume of new construction starts is expected to stay elevated this year, as land sales in 2020 remained high,"" said Nelson Wong, head of research for Greater China at commercial property services provider JLL.
Housing project construction investment will also be driven by developers who are accelerating project launches to raise cash amid tight financing conditions, he said. However, land purchase, the other component of real estate investment, is likely to slow down due to the tight financing situation.
The survey also found analysts think the COVID-19 epidemic will have a limited impact on China's property sector, and many believe the market will remain stable or further cool this year.
Most respondents say top-tier cities may extend tightening curbs to avoid market froth due to a low level of residential housing supply, while lower-tier cities facing a slump in demand may roll out more support.

Asked to rate the affordability of Chinese housing on a scale, with 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, analysts' median answer was 7, in line with the last poll.

The slowdown in the manufacturing sector underscores the fragility of the ongoing economic recovery in China, as Beijing grapples with a resurgence of local COVID-19 cases in northern China and navigates rising tensions with Washington and its allies.
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to 51.5 last month, the lowest level since June last year and easing markedly from December's reading of 53.0. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 52.7.
The survey broadly aligned with Beijing's official PMI on Sunday, which showed the recovery in factory activity slowing as COVID-19 cases rose.
A sub-index for production in the Caixin/Markit PMI dropped to 52.5 in January, the slowest pace of expansion since April last year, while another sub-index for new orders fell to 52.2, the lowest since June.
In particular, export orders plunged back into contraction in January, ending a five-month growth streak as the surging global pandemic suppressed foreign demand.
China's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year, thanks to the surprisingly resilient export sector, as factories raced to fill overseas orders amid a surging pandemic.
But recovery hopes are being dampened by a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases as authorities race to impose lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus in the country's north, affecting steel mills and consumer confidence.

""In addition, the weakening job market and the sharp increase in inflationary pressure should not be ignored.""
Average input costs continued to rise sharply during January, with the rate of inflation only easing slightly from December's three-year high. Respondents reported increased raw material prices and supplier shortages drove up expenses in January.
Factories continued to reduce their headcount at a faster pace in January. 

Manufacturers also reported widespread logistics delays as government imposed lockdown measures hit supply chains, leading to a marked increase in delivery times for suppliers.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A continued surge in demand for chips and bio-health products helped South Korea's exports to gain for a third month in January, signalling a recovery in global demand in the year ahead. 
Exports jumped 11.4% from a year earlier to $48.01 billion, after a 12.6% jump in December, government data showed on Monday, beating the 9.8% expansion forecast by 12 economists in a Reuters survey.
The trade picture of South Korea comes into a focus when it comes to global trade, as its monthly trade data is the first to be released among major exporting economies.
Sales of memory chips soared 21.7% year-on-year, continuing their stellar double-digit growth for a fifth month in a row as the nation's chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix, posted strong earnings. 
Exports of bio-health products soared 66.5% to continue its double-digit expansion for a 14th straight month. Of the nation's 15 major export items, shipments of 12 items, including memory chips, mobile devices, bio-health products and cars increased in January.
Imports increased 3.1% to $44.05 billion, also beating forecasts for a 1.9% increase.

The trade surplus shrank to $3.96 billion from $6.77 billion in December. By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, gained 1% year-on-year.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 51.3 in January from 51.9 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Sunday.
It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis, but was below the 51.6 expected in a Reuters poll of analyst forecasts.
In January, mainland China reported more than 2,000 local cases of the coronavirus. While the number was small compared with other countries, authorities were concerned about transmission risks during the Lunar New Year travel rush - the world's biggest annual human migration spanning 40 days from January to February.
During the month several large cities were locked down with tens of millions tested for COVID-19, interrupting factory activity and weighing on the services sector, including logistics and transportation.
""The recent localised epidemic has had a certain impact on the production and operation of some enterprises, and the overall expansion of the manufacturing industry has slowed,"" said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the statistics bureau.
""The period before and after the Lunar New Year is also traditionally an off-season for the country's manufacturing industry,"" Zhao said in an accompanying statement.
The new coronavirus outbreak, mostly in the north, is expected to be a temporary restraining factor while China's vast industrial sector continues to find strength in resilient export demand.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 50.2, expanding for the fifth straight month, though down from 51.3 in December. 
Economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pickup in the industrial sector. 
A sub-index for small firm activity stood at 49.4 in January, up from December's 48.8.
China's gross domestic product grew 2.3% on year in 2020, making it the only major economy in the world to dodge a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
The central bank will extend the country's monetary policy support for economic growth with a focus on maximising employment to help boost consumption, Governor Yi Gang said last week.

In the services sector, activity expanded for the 11th straight month, the statistics bureau said, albeit at a slower clip, weighed by the latest COVID-19 outbreaks.

891,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 07:21PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending decreases further; inflation creeping up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell for a second straight month in December amid renewed business restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19 and a temporary expiration of government-funded benefits for millions of unemployed Americans.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed inflation steadily rising last month. Expectations that inflation would perk up this year were supported by other data showing a solid increase in labor costs in the fourth quarter. 
But a rise above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average, is unlikely to worry policymakers. The U.S. central bank is expected to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance for a while as the economy battles the pandemic. Excess capacity remains throughout the economy, which could limit companies' ability to raise prices.
""The Fed would like inflation to average 2%, so it would like inflation to temporarily move above 2%,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Inflation pressures will remain limited to a few sectors as high unemployment will restrain wage growth."" 
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, slipped 0.2% last month as outlays at restaurants declined. Spending at hospitals also fell, likely as patients stayed away in fear of contracting the coronavirus.
Households also cut back spending on recreation. Consumer spending tumbled 0.7% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast spending would fall 0.4% in December.
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending decreased 0.6% last month after dropping 0.7% in November. That likely sets a lower base for consumer spending in the first quarter.
Another drop in January is not expected as states, including New York and California, have started easing pandemic-related restrictions. But outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods, the main driver of spending during the pandemic, fell for a second consecutive month in December. Spending on nondurable goods dropped for a third straight month. Services gained 0.1%.
""Goods spending has clearly rolled over, and we anticipate the pull-forward in demand in the second half of last year will also weigh on consumption of goods at the start of this year,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We do not anticipate spending to pick up significantly until a vaccine is widely administered.""
U.S. stocks fell sharply. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly lower. 
The data was included in Thursday's advance gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter, which showed the economy growing at a 4% annualized rate after a record 33.4% pace in the July-September period. Consumer spending rose at a 2.5% rate last quarter following a spectacular 41.0% growth pace in the third quarter.
Separately on Friday, the University of Michigan said its measure of consumer sentiment eased in January. A third report from the National Association of Realtors showed contracts to purchase homes decreased for a fourth straight month in December, suggesting some moderation in the housing market, one of the economy's star performers.
Growth is expected to decelerate to around a 2% rate in the first quarter as the economy works through the disruptions from a COVID-19 surge in the winter. Faster growth is expected by summer. The government provided nearly $900 billion in additional relief in late December and distribution of vaccines is expected to broaden and accelerate. 
President Joe Biden also has unveiled a recovery plan worth $1.9 trillion, though the package is likely to be pared down amid worries about the nation's swelling debt.
The late December stimulus package, which included direct cash payments to some households and renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14, helped to boost personal income, which rebounded 0.6% after tumbling 1.3% in November. 
Some of the money was stashed away, boosting the saving rate to 13.7% from 12.9% in November. 
Inflation crept higher. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy component gained 0.3% after being unchanged in November. In the 12 months through December, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5% after advancing 1.4% in November. The core PCE price index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. 
Gradually firming inflation was reinforced by a fourth report from the Labor Department showing its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after advancing 0.5% in the third quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation, as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Wages jumped 0.9% last quarter.
But with employment still 10 million jobs below the pre-pandemic peak, the rise is probably unsustainable. Still, inflation is seen accelerating in the months ahead as weak readings last March and April drop from the calculation.
Strengthening economic growth is also expected to boost price pressures. Bottlenecks in the supply chain are raising costs for manufacturers, and the increases are being passed on to consumers. Recent manufacturing surveys have shown a surge in price measures for both raw materials and finished products.

""Though inflation will accelerate this year, some of that will be transitory,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's economy last year suffered its biggest annual contraction since the 1930s, although it recovered better than expected from the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic during the final quarter, preliminary data showed on Friday.
Gross domestic product in Latin America's second-biggest economy tumbled by 8.5% last year in seasonally adjusted terms, according to the preliminary estimate issued by national statistics agency INEGI. The fall was slightly shallower than the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll for an 8.8% decline.
Still, the contraction was the sharpest since 1932 during the Great Depression, data published by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) show. And the economy has recently faced fresh headwinds due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.
During the second half of 2020, the economy made up much of the ground lost to the pandemic, and an unexpectedly robust performance in the October-December period helped lift the peso against the dollar early on Friday.
But the economy remains a major challenge for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose efforts to strengthen the state's hand in the energy market have led to disputes with businesses and upset Mexico's allies, chilling investment.
The second quarter bore the brunt of economic disruptions caused by the pandemic, before a sharp increase in infections towards the end of 2020 led to renewed commercial restrictions in the Mexico City metropolitan area before Christmas.
That is expected to dent the recovery in early 2021, which has seen deaths from coronavirus hitting record levels. Lopez Obrador himself contracted COVID-19 this month.
During the final three months of 2020, GDP advanced by 3.1% from the previous quarter in adjusted terms, beating the prediction for 2.8% growth seen in a Reuters poll.
Nikhil Sanghani, an economist at Capital Economics, said the figures for the fourth quarter meant that Mexico had recouped more than 70% of its losses from the first half of 2020.
""However, the recent surge in new COVID-19 cases will cause the recovery to grind to a halt in Q1,"" he said.
A breakdown of the unadjusted 2020 GDP figures showed manufacturing took the biggest hit last year. Secondary activities, which encompass factory output, fell by 10%, while tertiary activities, which include services, declined by 7.7%.
By contrast, primary activities such as farming, fishing and forestry, rose by 2.0% from 2019, the data showed.
The latest data also showed that 2020 was the second year running in which the economy went backwards. In 2019, the economy shrank by 0.1% in unadjusted terms, INEGI said.
Manufacturing activity has bounced back quickly from the depths of the slump, but companies are still wary about investing in new factories, buildings and machinery.
In the ten months through October, which is the latest data available, gross fixed investment was down by 19.5% compared with the same period in 2019, INEGI data show.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Alberto Ramos said in a client note that the outlook remained challenging for Mexico, though the rollout of a vaccination program would help the recovery.
""Firmer U.S. growth, stronger terms of trade, and additional moderate monetary policy easing should leverage the recovery,"" Ramos said. ""With the better than expected fourth quarter 2020 print we now expect real GDP growth to firm to 4.0% in 2021.""

The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7% last quarter after advancing 0.5% in the third quarter. That lifted the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.5% from 2.4% in the third quarter.
The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the ECI climbing 0.5% in the fourth quarter.
Wages and salaries increased 0.9% after gaining 0.4% in the third quarter. They were up 2.6% year-on-year. The private sector accounted for the surge in wages and salaries. Benefits rose 0.6%, matching the third quarter's increase.
Inflation is expected to pick up this year and breach the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average, as weak readings last March and April drop from the calculation. Price pressures are also seen boosted by a strengthening in economic growth, driven by fiscal stimulus and the inoculation of more Americans against COVID-19.

Bottlenecks in the supply chain are expected to contribute to higher inflation. Recent manufacturing surveys have shown a surge in price measures for both raw materials and finished products.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's pandemic-hit economy recorded its steepest contraction on record in 2020, and increasingly tough COVID-19 restrictions imposed since the turn of the year suggest that expectations of a strong rebound in 2021 may have to be scaled back.
Gross domestic product fell 11% last year, data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed on Friday, as revenues in the crucial tourism sector plummeted. 
That was more than the economy shrank over the five years during and after the global financial crisis that began in 2008, and historians said it marked the steepest drop since Spain's 1936-39 civil war. 
There was a modest recovery in the final three months, when higher spending boosted GDP 0.4% from the previous quarter, outstripping the 1.5% drop expected by analysts polled by Reuters.
But since then a third wave of contagion has been spreading across Europe and, like many of its neighbours, Spain has tightened curbs on movement, imposing regional curfews and restricting business hours.
The government's projects a 7.2% GDP rebound this year, above forecasts from markets analysts who last week cut their consensus to 6.3% from 6.5%.
The International Monetary Fund has trimmed its prediction to 5.9%, and warned that the euro zone's recovery is slipping behind those of other advanced economies including the United States and Japan.
Over 2020, a year in which global travel was dramatically curtailed, tourism accounted for just 4%-5% of Spain's GDP, according to estimates from Funcas analyst Maria Jesus Fernandez. That compares with a 12% share in 2019.
Agriculture was the only economic sector to expand, growing by 4.7%. Public spending grew 4.5%, its highest rate since 2008, while private consumption fell 12.4%, according to calculations by an INE official.
Between March and June 2020, Spain imposed one of Europe's toughest lockdowns, confining the population to their homes for all but essential activities and shutting down many industries.

That drove a 17.9% second-quarter slump in economic activity and, while the current lockdown allows people to circulate, many business activities have again been curtailed.

Goods exports and construction supported the economy while a renewed lockdown at the end of last year hit private consumption, the Office said on Friday. A Reuters poll had pointed to 0.0% fourth-quarter growth.
In the third quarter, the economy grew 8.5%.
""In Q4, this recovery was slowed by the second coronavirus wave and the renewed lockdown at the end of the year,"" the Statistics Office said.
""This particularly affected private consumption, while goods exports and construction investments supported the economy.""
The German government on Wednesday slashed its growth forecast for Europe's largest economy to 3% this year, a sharp revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4%, caused by a second coronavirus lockdown.
Presenting the revised forecast, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said he expected the upswing to continue in 2022 and for the economy to regain its pre-crisis level in the second half of next year.
Germany suffered its second-biggest economic plunge in post-war history last year.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed last week to extend the latest lockdown until mid-February as Germany, once a role model for fighting the pandemic, struggles with a second wave and record daily numbers of COVID-19 deaths.
The economy shrank by a smaller-than-expected 5% last year. That was surpassed in the post-war era only by the record -5.7% in 2009, during the financial crisis.

A survey published on Monday showed German business morale slumped to a six-month low in January as the second wave of COVID-19 halted an economic recovery.

The labour office said the number of people out of work in Europe's largest economy fell by 41,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.729 million. A Reuters poll had forecast a rise of 6,000.
""The labour market remains in a robust condition in January,"" Federal Labour Agency head Detlef Scheele said in a statement. ""But the measures in place to tame the coronavirus pandemic are leaving a mark.""
Germany has been in lockdown since mid-December as it battles a second wave of the virus.
The unemployment rate remained unchanged compared with the previous month at 6.0%.

The labour agency said some 2.26 million people were on shortened working hours in November under the government's Kurzarbeit scheme designed to avoid mass layoffs during a downturns by offering companies subsidies to keep workers on the payroll.

898,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 03:50AM ET</span>",France economy slumps less than expected in fourth quarter despite lockdown,"By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - The French economy contracted much less than expected at the end of last year, official data released on Friday showed, as the growing prospect of a new lockdown wipes out hopes for a recovery early this year.
The euro zone's second-biggest economy shrank 1.3% in the final three months of last year after France entered a second coronavirus lockdown in October to contain a second wave of infections, the INSEE statistics agency said.
The slump, which followed an 18.5% rebound in the third quarter after a first lockdown, exceeded expectations for a 4% contraction on average in a Reuters poll of 28 economists, surpassing even the highest estimate of -1.4%.
It also meant that for the whole of 2020, the economy contracted 8.3%, which though France's worst post-war recession was better than the -11% the government had forecast in its budget plans.
It also eases some of the strain on the public finances as the budget deficit is, therefore, likely to come in at less than the 11.3% of gross domestic product the government had expected.
France is on tenterhooks to find out in the coming days whether the government will put the country under a new lockdown and in particular whether schools will be closed.
""If the restrictions are made harder, it will be very difficult to get any growth"" in the first quarter, Euler Hermes France economist Selin Ozyurt.
INSEE said consumer spending surged 23% in December from the previous month as coronavirus restrictions were eased heading into the holiday period, which helped to limit the overall fourth-quarter drop in household spending - the traditional motor of the French economy.
Meanwhile, exports surpassed imports so that foreign trade contributed 0.9 percentage points to fourth quarter GDP while inventory building added 0.4 percentage points.

INSEE said that exports of transport goods and pharmaceuticals had held up well in the period while lower economic activity had limited imports of oil.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output extended declines in December as factories struggled with a hit to demand from expanded COVID-19 lockdown measures globally, suggesting the economic recovery was slowing.
The output slowdown may fan worries that the world's third-largest economy has failed to secure a firm footing after last year's sharp recession as businesses are pressured by a wider, local state of emergency covering parts of the country, including Tokyo.
Separate data showed the average number of available jobs per applicant for 2020 saw its biggest decline in 45 years, while the average jobless rate last year rose for the first time in 11 years.
Official data released on Friday showed factory output declined 1.6% in December, as falling production of general machinery and cars offset strength in inorganic and organic chemicals manufacturing.
The decline was larger than the previous month's 0.5% fall, but broadly in line with a 1.5% decline in a Reuters poll of economists.
""Output will likely be positive in the first quarter, but we expect (economic) growth to be negative. The biggest reason is the contraction in private spending due to the state of emergency,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank.
While the economy was likely to contract by around 5% on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter, it was still expected to avoid a technical recession--two straight quarters of decline--thanks to a second-quarter rebound in exports and output, he said.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to rebound 8.9% in January and decline 0.3% in February.
Although production was still likely to grow at a sharp pace in January, manufacturers' forecasts didn't fully reflect the impact of Japan's new state of emergency, a trade ministry official said.
Factory output weakened in November as a rebound in car production ended on sagging global demand. Analysts worry that is delaying Japan's recovery with the economy at risk from starting the year with a contraction.
COVID-19 HURTS JOBS
Official data on Friday also showed the average jobs-to-applicants ratio for 2020 was 1.18, down 0.42 point from 2019, its biggest annual fall since 1975. The ratio was unchanged at 1.06 in December from the previous month.
Other data showed the average jobless rate stood at 2.8% in 2020, up for the first time since 2009 when the Lehman Brothers collapse hit the employment sector.
An average of 2.56 million people per month were furloughed last year, the highest since comparable data became available in 1968.
The country's seasonally adjusted jobless rate held steady at 2.9% in December, beating the median estimate of 3.0%.
Meanwhile, the core consumer price index for Tokyo, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, fell 0.4% in January from a year earlier, down for a sixth straight month, government data showed on Friday.

In the consumer sector, sentiment worsened in January, an official gauge showed on Friday, prompting the government to cut its view on the closely watched index, saying it was on a weak tone.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) is expected to dip slightly to 51.6 in January from 51.9 in December, according to the median forecast of 20 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion inactivity on a monthly basis.
""High-frequency indicators suggest a slowdown in production as temperature cools and Lunar New Year holiday approaches,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an analyst at the Bank of Communications, in a note to clients. 
China's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 6.5% in the fourth quarter last year, thanks to the surprisingly resilient export sector, as factories raced to fill overseas orders amid a surging pandemic.
Profits at China's industrial firms surged 20.1% year-on-year in December, helped by improving factory-gate prices, which fell at their slowest pace since February last month.
But recovery hopes are being dampened by a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases as authorities in Northern China raced to impose lockdown measures to curb the spread of the virus, affecting steel mills and consumer confidence.
Many exporters have told Reuters that they're facing a squeeze in their profit margins amid a shortage of containers, an appreciating Chinese currency and rising raw material prices.
""The surging shipping costs and a tumbling U.S. dollar have forced our factories to give up on some overseas orders,"" said a business owner that runs several textile factories in the southeastern city of Jiaxing.
""So we've decided to let workers go home earlier than usual,"" the owner said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Sunday.

The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Monday. Analysts expect that headline reading will dip to 52.7from 53 in December.

New home sales increased 1.6% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 842,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. November's sales pace was revised down to 829,000 units from the previously reported 841,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales would rebound 1.9% to a rate of 865,000 units in December. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile on a month-to-month basis. New home sales jumped 15.2% on a year-on-year basis. Sales totaled 811,000 in 2020, up 18.8% from 2019.
The government reported last week that housing starts soared in December to their highest level since September 2006. Permits for future homebuilding were also the highest since August 2006. But surging lumber prices and labor and land shortages could slow the housing market momentum. 
The housing market is being supported by cheaper mortgages and an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as companies allow employees to work from home and schools shift to online classes because of the coronavirus pandemic. About 23.7% of the labor force is working from home. Lower-wage earners in the services sector have borne the brunt of the COVID-19 crisis.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around 2.77%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). 
In December, new home sales rose in the Midwest and West, but fell in the Northeast and South.

The median new house price surged 8% to $355,900 in December from a year ago. There were 302,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 290,000 in November. At December's sales pace it would take 4.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 4.2 months in November.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>",German inflation roars back and hits 11-month high in Jan,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German annual consumer prices turned positive and rose by far more than expected in January, the Federal Statistics Office said on Thursday, attributing a rise in sales tax and the minimum wage as factors behind the increase.
Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, rose by 1.6% year-on-year after declining by 0.7% in December.
January's reading was the highest since 1.7% last February, the Statistics Office told Reuters. It compared with a Reuters forecast for a rise of 0.5%.
""In addition to the changes in VAT rates, the development of consumer prices may also be influenced by other factors such as the CO2 price and the increase in the statutory minimum wage from January 2021,"" the Statistics Office said in a statement.
The European Central Bank targets an inflation rate of below but close to 2% across the euro zone. Annual inflation for the euro area stood at -0.3% last month.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the surge was mainly the result of the reversal of last year’s VAT reduction, higher energy prices and a new carbon tax.
But, in a note headlined ""Germany: inflation shock"", he added: ""Today’s inflation number is just the beginning of a period of significantly higher headline inflation in Germany ... With price mark ups in some sectors once the economy starts to reopen again, headline inflation in Germany could be pushed above 2% after the summer.""
Klaas Knot, a member of the ECB's Governing Council, said on Wednesday he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about Europe's economy recovering during 2021, as the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines should give more room for growth in the second half of the year.

Interest rates in the euro zone will remain low in the foreseeable future, he added, as relatively low production will limit inflation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted at its sharpest pace since World War Two in 2020 as COVID-19 ravaged services businesses like restaurants and airlines, throwing millions of Americans out of work and into poverty.
The Commerce Department's snapshot of fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday also showed the recovery from the pandemic losing steam as the year wound down amid a resurgence in coronavirus infections and exhaustion of nearly $3 trillion in relief money from the government.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and pledged to continue injecting money into the economy through bond purchases, noting that ""the pace of the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months."" 
President Joe Biden has unveiled a recovery plan worth $1.9 trillion, and could use the GDP report to lean on some lawmakers who have balked at the price tag soon after the government provided nearly $900 billion in additional stimulus at the end of December. 
The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance since 1946. That followed 2.2% growth in 2019 and was the first annual decline in GDP since the 2007-09 Great Recession. The economy plunged into recession last February
In the fourth quarter, GDP increased at a 4.0% annualized rate as the virus and lack of another spending package curtailed consumer spending, and partially overshadowed robust manufacturing and the housing market. GDP growth for the last quarter was in line with forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. 
The big step-back after a historic 33.4% growth pace in the July-September period left GDP well below its level at the end of 2019. With the virus not yet under control, economists are expecting growth to further slow down in the first quarter of 2021, before regaining speed by summer as the additional stimulus kicks in and more Americans get vaccinated. 
The services sector has borne the brunt of the coronavirus recession, disproportionately impacting lower-wage earners, who tend to be women and minorities. That has led to a so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out. 
The stars of the recovery have been the housing market and manufacturing as those who are still employed seek larger homes away from city centers, and buy electronics for home offices and schooling. Manufacturing's share of GDP has increased to 11.9% from 11.6% at the end of 2019.
A survey last week by professors at the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame showed poverty increased by 2.4 percentage points to 11.8% in the second half of 2020, boosting the ranks of the poor by 8.1 million people.

Rising poverty was underscored by persistent labor market weakness. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said 847,000 more people filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week. The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. Only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered.

904,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 08:38AM ET</span>","U.S. Economy Slowed Sharply in Q4; Jobless Claims Decline to 847,000","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The U.S. economy slowed sharply in the final quarter of 2020 as a third wave of coronavirus infections caused states across the country to put tight restrictions on social gatherings and economic activity.
Gross domestic product expanded at an annualized rate of 4.0% in the three months through December, according to the Census Bureau’s first reading. The reading is likely to be revised over the coming weeks.
That contrasts with an annualized growth rate of 33% in the three months through September, when the economy broadly reopened after the first wave of infections and lockdowns.
The number was exactly in line with expectations ahead of time. It means that over 2020 as a whole, the economy contracted by 3.6%, its worst contraction since 1946.
The figures suggest that, in the second half of the year, the economy recovered around three-quarters of what it lost in output in the first half, Jason Furman, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute, said via Twitter.
Most analysts expect the economy to bounce back strongly this year, with many noting that output and consumption have remained relatively resilient under the latest wave of lockdowns as businesses and consumers have adapted to the new circumstances. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday raised its estimate for U.S. GDP growth in 2021 to 5.1%, having expected only a 3.1% rebound as recently as October.
At the same time, the Department of Labor reported a bigger-than-expected drop in the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits last week, although the number remained stubbornly high at 847,000. Analysts had expected claims a number of 875,000.
The improvement was not as large as seemed at first glance, however: the previous week’s figure was revised upward by 14,000 to 914,000.
The number of those making continuing claims for benefits, which comes with a one-week lag to the initial claims estimate, fell to its lowest since April at 4.77 million. Including those claiming under pandemic-specific programs, the total number of those claiming unemployment-related benefits as of January 9 rose by nearly 3 million to 18.28 million. That was due largely to a jump in claimants for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance."

LONDON (Reuters) - Early signs of disruption caused by Britain's shift to its new, less open trading relationship with the European Union are emerging in economic data.
Although the biggest problem for many companies remains the COVID-19 pandemic, details of recent surveys show that Brexit is adding to the strain on the economy.
Manufacturers and services firms have been hit hard by supply chain and export disruption, according to data company IHS Markit.
British factories reported the steepest increase in supplier delivery times among the six ""flash"" preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) surveys published by IHS Markit last week for France, Germany, Japan, Australia and the United States as well as the United Kingdom.
""This was almost exclusively linked to both Brexit disruption and a severe lack of international shipping availability,"" IHS Markit said.
For a graphic on: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/gjnvwrkzxpw/gCNti-uk-factories-see-biggest-rise-in-supplier-delivery-times%20(1).png
Under a deal struck last month, trade between Britain and the European Union remains free of tariffs and quotas but a new full customs border means goods must be checked and paperwork filled in.
Using a phrase that has angered many business owners, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the disruption as ""teething problems"" which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Trade experts think some of the extra cost and bureaucracy will be permanent. Proponents of Brexit say Britain will benefit in the long run by striking its own trade deals and forming its own regulations outside the EU.
Brexit disruption in the first quarter of 2021 was likely to reduce British economic output by around 1%, International Monetary Fund Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said on Wednesday.
Services companies - which account for the bulk of the British economy and generate a surplus in trade with the bloc - were hit this month, the IHS Markit survey showed.
Services exports deteriorated faster in Britain than in any other of the six flash PMIs published this month, bucking a trend of improvement seen in most other countries.
For a graphic on: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/azgpolyenvd/2idcN-uk-services-export-orders-show-fastest-drop-pmi.png
""The service economy was hard-hit by restrictions on trade and reduced consumer spending at the start of the year,"" IHS Markit said.
Following the initial disruption, a truer picture of the costs and benefits of Brexit is likely to emerge over time, although many businesses are not hopeful.
A Confederation of British Industry survey published last week showed British manufacturers' confidence in their ability to compete in the EU market has fallen to its lowest level since records began 20 years ago.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 12:35AM ET</span>",South Korea's January exports likely to grow for third month underpinning recovery momentum: Reuters poll,"By Joori Roh and Jihoon Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely expanded for a third straight month in January on continued strong chip sales and overseas demand, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday, underpinning export-led recovery hopes in the economy.
Overseas sales in the first month of 2021 were seen increasing 9.8% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of 12 economists.
That would be slower than a 12.6% rise in December, when it marked the sharpest growth in over 2 years, but remaining on a recovery track that began in November.
""Interim exports data showed that the two key semiconductor and auto sectors were pretty strong with double-digit growth. We also noticed the sustained strength of exports to the U.S. and EU despite the worsening of the pandemic in these two major economies,"" said Oh Suktae, economist at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
Preliminary data showed shipments of chips and cars jumped 11.6% and 15.7%, respectively, during Jan. 1-20.
Imports were expected to have risen 1.9% in January, after growing 2.2% last month, on higher oil and commodity prices.
Economists see vaccine distribution and easing of coronavirus-related regulations in major economies to further tow the export recovery track.
""Vaccination is already underway in some of South Korea's major trading partners, which will likely lead to a more sustained relaxation of social distancing measures. This should support a rebound in global trade this year, providing a tailwind for South Korean exports,"" said Lloyd Chan, an economist at Oxford Economics.
Trade data for January will be out on Feb. 1 at 9 a.m. local time (0000 GMT).
Meanwhile, 15 economists predicted industrial output in December would expand by a seasonally adjusted 1.2% month-on-month, after rising 0.3% a month earlier.

Nine economists also estimated consumer prices in January would rise a median 0.3% year-on-year, slowing from December's 0.5% rise.

However, as the world's second-largest economy bounces back from COVID-triggered paralysis, growth in fiscal revenue accelerated to 5.5% in the fourth quarter, from 4.7% the previous quarter, the ministry said in a statement on its website. 
China's economy picked up speed in the fourth quarter, with growth beating expectations as it ended a rough coronavirus-striken 2020 in remarkably good shape and remained poised to expand further this year even as the global pandemic rages unabated.
The finance ministry expects tax and fee cut efforts last year helped reduce burdens on corporates by more than 2.5 trillion yuan, and pledged to continue implement reforms in value-added tax and personal income tax to maintain the necessary support to the economic recovery. 
""Some industries are still digesting the negative impact brought by the pandemic and the foundations of a steady economic rebound are yet to be consolidated,"" said the ministry. 
It added the ratio of 2020 government debt to GDP stood at 45.8%, which was lower than the international redline of 60%. 
Going forward, authorities would maintain a stable macro leverage ratio, balancing the needs of economic growth and risk control, said the finance ministry, adding that it would reasonably determine the size of government bonds to maintain an appropriate magnitude of spending. 

It would firmly curb the increase in hidden local government debts and properly resolve the outstanding hidden debt issues, it said.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 03:50PM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders rise strongly in boost to business investment,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased for an eighth straight month in December, pointing to solid growth in business spending on equipment in the fourth quarter and likely helping to underpin the economic recovery.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday was published ahead of the government's snapshot of fourth-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, expected to show a sharp slowdown in growth after a historic pace of expansion in the third quarter.
The anticipated loss of momentum will likely reflect a resurgence in COVID-19 cases and exhaustion of relief money from the government. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and made no change to its monthly bond purchases, noting ""the recovery in economic activity and employment has moderated in recent months.""
""Business demand for new equipment is booming but Fed officials know that until companies start to rehire workers, the economic recovery will be incomplete,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders advanced 1.0% in November. Last month's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
Core capital goods orders surged 1.8% year-on-year in December. Demand has shifted away from services like travel and hospitality towards goods like motor vehicles, electronics and medical equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. That has contributed to boosting production at factories, though output remains about 2.6% below its pre-pandemic level.
(Graphic: Core capital goods: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jbyprnbaxpe/capgds.png)
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the economy, is also being supported by businesses rebuilding depleted inventories. In December, core capital goods orders were lifted by demand for machinery and primary and fabricated metal products. But orders for computers and electronic products fell while bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components barely rose.
U.S. stocks trimmed losses after the Fed's interest rate decision. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
SHIPMENTS RISE
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.5% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement. They gained 0.5% in November. Unfilled orders of core capital goods increased 0.7%, matching November's gain.
Strong business spending on equipment likely helped to partially offset an anticipated slowdown in consumer spending last quarter. According to a Reuters survey of economists, GDP likely increased at a 4.0% annualized rate last quarter after surging at a record 33.4% pace in the July-September period.
""Factory activity saw a quicker-than-expected recovery and should remain well supported in the near-term as businesses restock inventories and consumers continue to spend on consumer goods,"" said Lydia Boussour, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
It will likely remain supported by nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus provided by the government at the end of December, which is seen jolting consumer spending in January after it slowed in the last two months. President Joe Biden has unveiled a recovery plan worth $1.9 trillion, though there is resistance from some lawmakers. 
The economy contracted at a 31.4% rate in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Business investment on equipment rebounded strongly in the third quarter after five straight quarterly declines. Regional manufacturing surveys have suggested that the strength in business investment could be sustained in the near term. 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, gained 0.2% in December after rising 1.2% in November. Durable goods orders were restrained by a 1.0% decline in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.9% increase in November. 
(Graphic: Durable goods: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/rlgpdgqbqvo/durgds.png)
Orders for civilian aircraft plunged 51.8%. This was despite Boeing (NYSE:BA) reporting on its website that it had received 90 aircraft orders in December, up from 27 in November. 
The government recently lifted a 20-month grounding of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets that came after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Boeing on Wednesday reported a record annual loss because of the pandemic and 737 MAX safety crisis. 

Orders for motor vehicles and parts rose 1.4% in December after accelerating 2.8% in November.

Profits surged 20.1% year-on-year in December to 707.11 billion yuan ($109.40 billion), after rising 15.5% in November, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Wednesday.
China is the only major economy in the world to avoid a contraction in 2020, with gross domestic product up 2.3% for the full year, while many countries remain crippled by the pandemic. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect China's GDP to rise 8.4% in 2021, the fastest pace in a decade. However, some analysts cautioned that a slower recovery in consumption and a potential rapid slowdown in credit growth could be risks for the Asian powerhouse.
China's factory gate prices fell last month at their slowest pace since February, pointing to improving corporate profitability.
For the full year of 2020, annual profits for China's industrial firms grew 4.1% year-on-year to 6.45 trillion yuan, recovering from a 3.3% on-year decline seen in 2019. It was also quicker than a 2.4% gain seen in January-November.
The profit gains last year were notably driven by the manufacturing sector, which saw margins increase by 7.6%, said Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the statistics bureau, in a statement published alongside the data.
China's exports were surprisingly strong last year as factories raced to fill overseas orders amid a raging pandemic. 
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.1% year-on-year at end-December, versus 6.8% growth as of end-November and a 5.4% uptick as of end-2019.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 2.9% for 2020 year-on-year, compared with a 4.9% decline in January-November and 12.0% slump in 2019, the statistics bureau data showed. 
Private sector profits grew 3.1% in 2020, improving from January-November's 1.8% growth and stronger than 2019's 2.2% rise.

The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

910,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 09:09PM ET</span>",Australia’s Inflation Exceeds Estimates as Recovery Builds,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s consumer prices rose faster than forecast in the final three months of last year as the government amended funding to various stimulus programs amid an economy regaining momentum.
The consumer price index advanced 0.9% from the third quarter, underpinned by increases in tobacco excise, compared with economists’ estimates of a 0.7% gain, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. Annual CPI also beat forecasts, similarly rising by 0.9% versus an estimated 0.7%.
“Since the June quarter fall of 0.3%, the increase in annual inflation largely reflects the unwinding of free child care and higher petrol prices,” said Michelle Marquardt, head of Prices Statistics at the ABS. “The rise in demand for new dwellings is reflected in higher building approvals for houses and a record value for housing loan commitments.”
Australian prices have been hit by cross-currents caused by fallout from Covid-19 and governments ending some support programs in favor of stimulus for areas like housing. The Reserve Bank of Australia has adjusted its inflation framework to allow the economy to run a little hotter. It doesn’t intend to tighten borrowing costs until inflation is sustainably within the 2-3% target.
Achieving that will require strong wage growth stemming from a tighter labor market, outcomes unlikely to be in the offing any time soon with the jobless rate at 6.6%.
Today’s report showed the quarterly trimmed-mean gauge of inflation matched estimates, rising 0.4%, and slightly exceeded them on an annual basis, advancing 1.2% versus a forecast 1.1%
The weighted-median gauge, another core measure, advanced 0.5% from the third quarter for an annual increase of 1.4%, compared with forecast increases of 0.4% and 1.2%, respectively.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“There is little sign of emerging inflation pressure, with such tension only witnessed in higher purchase costs for new dwellings and motor vehicles, and a stabilization in rents..”
-- James McIntyre, economist

Separate data released at the same time as inflation, showed business conditions -- measuring hiring, sales and profits -- surged in December to the highest level since 2018. The employment index surged, reflecting Australia’s strengthening labor market that has seen unemployment fall to 6.6% in December from a high of 7.5% in July. The economy entered the pandemic with a jobless rate of 5.1% in February 2020.
“The rise in the employment index is very encouraging,” said Alan Oster, chief economist at National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. that runs the monthly business sentiment survey. “The gains have been seen across all states and notably, Victoria appears to have caught up with New South Wales and Queensland -- great news for the state that has suffered an extended lockdown.”
Yet, business confidence slid in the period amid a flareup in Covid outbreaks in Sydney and elsewhere.
More Detail
Today’s inflation report showed tradables prices, which are typically impacted by the currency and global factors, fell 0.4% in the fourth quarter from the previous three months. Non-tradables, which are largely affected by domestic variables like utilities and rents, advanced 1.5% due to the scheduled hike in the tobacco excise.
Other details in the report include:
The Reserve Bank of Australia meets for the first time this year on Tuesday and is expected to keep its cash rate and yield target to 0.10%. It is also set to maintain its A$100 billion ($77.4 billion) quantitative easing program.

The British Retail Consortium, a trade body, said on Wednesday that its members saw average prices fall by 2.2% in January compared with a year earlier, the largest such fall since the depths of Britain's first lockdown in May.
Food prices rose by 0.2%, the smallest increase since January 2017, and non-food prices dropped by 3.6%.
""Post-Christmas sales and the national lockdown drove non-food prices down – especially for clothing and DIY goods,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
Britain's official measure of consumer price inflation, which covers a wider range of goods and services, showed annual prices rises of 0.6% in December.
Dickinson said that as well as facing softer consumer demand, retailers were under pressure from higher costs which they may prove unable to absorb.
""Brexit-related red tape, rising global shipping costs and food commodity prices, as well as the weight of forced closures and restrictions for many retail businesses, means that pricing pressures are stacking up,"" she said.
New lockdown measures to combat a surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths have added to a normal post-Christmas belt-tightening by British consumers.

Experimental data last week from the Office for National Statistics, which is not seasonally adjusted, showed a 35% fall in consumer spending in early January, and on Tuesday the Confederation of British Industry reported its weakest retail number since May.

912,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 01:50PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence edges higher; house prices accelerate,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rose moderately in January while lingering concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic led to a further deterioration in households' perceptions of the labor market, raising the risk of a second straight month of job losses.
But the survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed consumers more than willing to buy homes and automobiles in the next six months, indicating that the housing market and manufacturing industry will continue to underpin the economy. 
""The slow rollout of the vaccines and the still-raging pandemic continue to depress consumer confidence despite the prospect of further fiscal aid and a brighter health situation,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index increased to a reading of 89.3 this month from 87.1 in December. The slight gain likely reflected nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government at the end of December, which lifted consumers' near-term expectations.
The was no indication that the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters had impacted on confidence. The cut-off date for the survey was Jan. 14. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index little changed at 89 in January.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, fell to a reading of 84.4 from 87.2 in December. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions increased to 92.5 from a reading of 87.0 in December, suggesting households foresee conditions improving in the near term.
President Joe Biden has unveiled a $1.9 trillion recovery plan from the pandemic. The new Biden administration has pledged to speed up and simplify the distribution of vaccines. 
More than 25 million people have been infected by the virus, with the death toll over 420,000 since the pandemic started in the United States in early 2020. About 6% of the U.S. population has so far been vaccinated. Economists said though Biden's rescue plan was facing resistance from some lawmakers, that was unlikely to derail the recovery from the pandemic. 
""It is not likely we will see any household and business subsidy plan passed before March or April,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland Pennsylvania. ""That should be early enough to get us through the year, even if there are significant cuts to the subsidies.""
U.S. stocks were little changed. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower. 
(Graphic: Consumer confidence: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkvlkarxpb/consconf.png)
LABOR MARKET STILL SHAKY
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, deteriorated to a reading of -3.2 this month from -1.9 in December. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report.
The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. 
""Jobs are harder to get or not as plentiful for a second month in a row and we will see if this means a second month of negative payroll jobs is in store for the markets in the report for January due out next Friday,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income decreased to 14.4% from 15.7% last month. The proportion anticipating a drop declined to 14.2% from 14.6% in December.
More consumers expected to purchase homes and motor vehicles in the next six months. Though buying plans for major household appliances were little changed, more expected to purchase refrigerators and washing machines. 
The pandemic has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners mostly in the services industry. It has fueled a migration from city centers to suburbs and other lower-density areas as Americans seek more space for home offices and schooling. Record-low mortgage rates are also boosting the housing market.
But supply is failing to keep up, leading to a surge in house prices, which economists and realtors warn could put homeownership out of the reach of many first-time buyers. A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index jumped 9.1% from a year ago in November after rising 8.0% in October.
(Graphic: Case Shiller: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/bdwpkylxopm/caseshiller.png)
Robust house price inflation was corroborated by a third report showing the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index surged a seasonally adjusted 11.0% year-on-year in November after increasing 10.3% in October.
The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).

""Demand for homes remains strong and with inventories at historic lows, home prices will likely continue to accelerate over coming months, until supply can catch up,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's unemployment rate hit its highest in nearly five years in the three months to November, when coronavirus cases began to rise for a second time and most of the country returned to a partial lockdown.
Redundancies touched a record high, taking the unemployment rate to 5.0%, its highest since mid-2016, according to official data, although the increase was slightly weaker than economists' forecasts.
There were some signs of a limited recovery in December, when lockdown measures eased, although a deterioration is likely in early 2021 as a tougher lockdown shut schools and closed most non-essential businesses to the public.
Tax data for December showed a 52,000 increase in the number of staff on company payrolls from November, but there were 828,000 fewer workers on payrolls than in February.
Economists said the data showed the jobs market was holding up better than many forecasters had feared.
Unemployment has been kept down by the government's Job Retention Scheme, which supported 2.4 million jobs as of Oct. 31, down from a peak of 8.9 million in May.
The programme is Britain's most expensive COVID-19 economic support measure, costing 46.4 billion pounds ($63 billion) up to mid-December, and is due to end on April 30.
""This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped – and every job lost as a result is a tragedy,"" finance minister Sunak said after Tuesday's data. ""We're throwing everything we've got at supporting businesses, individuals and families.""
Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, urged Sunak to extend support for jobs in his March 3 budget. 
""The latest lockdown will have only added further pressure on firms with troubled balance sheets, which means more jobs are likely to be lost in the coming months,"" Parikh said.
The number of people in employment dropped 88,000 in the three months to the end of November, the smallest fall since the start of the pandemic and less than the 100,000 drop forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said this month that he believed the underlying jobless rate was higher, as the official definition excludes people without work who have temporarily postponed their job search due to the pandemic.
The data showed growth in wages rose by an annual 3.6%, the biggest increase in more than a year. 

But the ONS said the increase largely reflected how the brunt of job cuts and lost pay had fallen on workers in lower-paid sectors and on part-time workers. Underlying pay growth was less than 2%, it said.

Higher construction costs due to preparations for the Olympics and popularity of high-rise condominiums in formerly industrial waterfront areas helped drive the average apartment price up to 60.84 million yen ($586,410), the highest since 1990 when it reached a record 61.23 million yen.
The most expensive unit was a 690 million yen ($6.65 million) condominium in Daikanyama, the real estate data and consultancy firm said.
The number of sales fell 12.8% from a year earlier to 27,228 units, however, down around 70% from 1990 levels. 
Real estate website Suumo said in a report last week that low interest rates and tax breaks helped sustain property demand amid the coronavirus outbreak.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter as it ended the coronavirus-stricken year solidly poised for a recovery in 2021 thanks to surging exports. 
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew a seasonally adjusted 1.1% in the December quarter from the third quarter, the Bank of Korea said on Tuesday, faster than the median estimate of 0.7% in a Reuters poll and following a 2.1% expansion in the September quarter.
That limited the contraction over the whole year to 1.0%, which is likely to be the smallest GDP slump among the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development in the year of the pandemic that has killed more than 2 million worldwide. 
""Recovery momentum should gather pace from the second quarter onwards, led by strong export prospects as global growth and 5G deployment pick up speed,"" said Lloyd Chan, an economist at Oxford Economics.
""A vaccine rollout around February should also stimulate domestic demand, as it would reduce the need for stringent containment measures,"" he said.
South Korea's economy has had a sharp albeit uneven bounce since the second quarter when it suffered its steepest downturn in over a decade.
A recent Reuters poll of 27 economists forecast the economy to grow 3.0% this year, in line with the BOK's projections.
December exports rose 12.6% from a year earlier, the biggest expansion in 26 months.
Underlining the optimism, shares of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) has surged about 50% in the fourth quarter alone as it reported a 26% jump in its fourth quarter profit.
But the number of jobs plunged at the sharpest rate in over two decades in December, while private consumption over the fourth quarter declined 1.7% in a sign the recovery is still fragile amid a third wave of the coronavirus now sweeping the country.
Construction investment rose 6.5% from a quarter earlier, marking the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2019. 
On a year-on-year basis, the economy shrank 1.4% in the fourth quarter, versus the 1.7% decline forecast in the poll. 
Last year, the government pledged fiscal stimulus of about 310 trillion won ($281.4 billion), while the BOK cut interest rates by 75 basis points to 0.5%.
Most analysts expect the BOK to retain its accommodative policy stance in 2021.

""BOK will keep emphasizing financial stability, but that does not mean any unwinding of easier monetary policy adopted after COVID-19,"" Lee Seung-hoon, an economist at Meritz Securities said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Some 8.8% of global working hours were lost last year due to the pandemic, roughly four times the number lost in the 2009 financial crisis, but there are ""tentative signs"" of recovery, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said on Monday.
The losses compared with the previous year were equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs and included an ""unprecedented"" 114 million workers joining the ranks of the unemployed and others whose working hours were reduced due to restrictions, it said.
""These massive losses resulted in an 8.3 per cent decline in global labour income (before support measures are included), equivalent to $3.7 trillion or 4.4 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP),"" the ILO, a U.N. agency, said in its seventh report on the crisis since March.
Guy Ryder, ILO director-general, told a news briefing: ""This has been the most severe crisis for the world of work since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Its impact is far greater than that of the global financial crisis of 2009.""
""I am pleased to say that there is some relatively good news in all of this, that we do see tentative signs of recovery - these signs are fragile, they are uncertain and the prospects are notably uneven,"" he said.
But it was ""particularly concerning"" that 71% of the job losses, or 81 million people, came in the form of inactivity, Ryder said. ""These people have simply dropped out of the labour market. Either they are unable to work, perhaps because of pandemic restrictions, or social obligations or they have given up looking for work,"" he added.
And more hours will be lost this year and possibly next.
""All scenarios project that working hour losses will continue, in other words the financial and social distress for millions of people will continue through 2021 and beyond that,"" Ryder said.
ILO data show that women and younger workers were most affected, while the hardest-hit sectors were accommodation, food services, retail and manufacturing, it said.
""There are some sectors - there are the financial sectors, the information technology sectors - which have actually continued to grow in the course of 2020,"" Ryder said.
Employment loss among 15-24 years old stood at 8.7% compared with 3.7% for adults and ""highlights the all too real risk of a lost generation"", it said. 

""While there is still a high degree of uncertainty, the latest projections for 2021 show that most countries will experience a relatively strong recovery in the second half of the year, as vaccination programmes take effect,"" the ILO said.

Companies signed up for $12.1 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $12.9 billion a year earlier. Borrowings in December, however, rose 66% from the previous month.
ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said most equipment finance sector observers would consider a single-digit decline in year-over-year new business volume tolerable, given the optimism around new U.S. stimulus measures and COVID-19 vaccine distribution.
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals rose to 75.2% in December from 70.4% in November.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) Inc and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc, Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY).
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, reported monthly confidence index of 59.6% in January, unchanged from December.
A reading of above 50 indicates a positive business outlook.

The report showed that consumers are slowly spending more as the economy reopens and more people gradually return to work, and offered a sign consumers are hopeful their financial situations will improve further as the coronavirus is contained. 
The share of households that made at least one large purchase in the last four months rose to 54.6% in December. That is up from a series low of 50.7% in April of 2020, but was still well below pre-pandemic level of 62.5% in December of 2019.
Consumers from all education and income groups were much more optimistic about how much they would be able to spend in a year, with the median household expecting spending to grow by 3% over the next year, up from 2.2% in August. 
Households reported in December that they expect spending on daily living expenses and other necessary bills to rise by a median of 4.1% over the next year, up from 3.5% in August and reaching a series high for the survey.
Consumers also said they expected spending on nonessential items such as hobbies, entertainment and travel, to rise by a median 1.6% over the next year, up from 1.0% in August and also reaching a high for the survey. 
If surprised with a 10% increase in income, consumers said they would allocated an average 36.3% to paying down debt, 44.5% would be saved or invested and 19.3% would be spent or donated. 

The household spending survey is conducted every four months as part of the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale slumped to a six-month low in January as a second wave of COVID-19 halted a recovery in Europe's largest economy, which will stagnate in the first quarter, the Ifo economic institute said on Monday.
Ifo said its business climate index fell to 90.1 from an upwardly revised reading of 92.2 in December. A Reuters poll had forecast a January reading of 91.8.
""The second Corona wave has temporarily ended the recovery of the German economy,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed last week to extend a lockdown until mid-February as Germany, once seen as a role model for fighting the pandemic, struggles with a second wave of infections.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters the economy would stagnate in the first quarter of the year, adding: ""The German economy is starting the year with little confidence.""
The economy is likely to reach its pre-pandemic levels in mid-2022, according to a draft document prepared by the economy ministry and seen by Reuters on Monday.
In a telling sign of corporate nervousness, Ifo's expectations index fell to its lowest level since June, confounding expectations for a rise.
Unprecedented government rescue and stimulus measures helped lessen the shock of the pandemic in Germany last year, when the economy shrank by 5.0%, less than expected and a smaller contraction than during the global financial crisis.
But the renewed lockdown measures are suppressing economic activity and confidence. Ifo's index on current conditions fell to its lowest since September.
""Fear is back,"" wrote ING economist Carsten Brzeski. ""It will take more momentum in the vaccination schemes and a further reduction in the number of infections before the economy can take off again. It currently looks as if it will take at least until spring time before this will be the case.""
Highlighting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on German industry, carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Friday profit almost halved last year because of the pandemic, but a rebound in premium car sales in China and stronger deliveries in the fourth quarter helped keep it in the black.
The Federal Statistics Office will publish gross domestic product figures on Friday for the fourth quarter, when some lockdown measures had already been implemented. The statistics office said earlier this month growth probably stagnated in the fourth quarter.

The government expects the economy to grow by 3% this year, a government official told Reuters on Friday, a sharp downward revision from last autumn's estimate of 4.4% caused by November's imposition of a second coronavirus lockdown.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity near 14-year high; home sales rise in December,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity surged to its highest level in nearly 14 years in early January, but bottlenecks in the supply chain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are driving up prices and signaling a rise in inflation in the months ahead.
Other data on Friday showed an unexpected increase in sales of previously owned homes in December. Manufacturing and the housing market are helping to anchor the economy, which is being battered by a wave of coronavirus infections. But the pandemic is causing labor shortages at construction sites and factories, which could erode some of the strength in the manufacturing and housing sectors.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI accelerated to a reading of 59.1 in the first half of this month, the highest since May 2007, from 57.1 in December.
Economists had forecast the index would slip to 56.5 in early January. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing is being supported by businesses rebuilding inventories and a shift in demand towards goods from services because of the pandemic.
The IHS Markit survey's measure of new orders received by factories raced to its highest level since September 2014. The surge in demand reflected both existing and new customers, ""with some clients reportedly committing to orders previously placed on hold."" That led to manufacturers hiring more workers early this month. The survey's factory employment index increased to 54.8 from 52.2 in December.
But the pandemic is gumming up the supply chain, resulting in manufacturers paying more for materials, and they are passing on the higher production costs to consumers. The survey's gauge of prices received by factories vaulted to its highest level since July 2008.
This mirrored other manufacturing surveys, suggesting inflation could pick up and remain elevated beyond the anticipated boost from the drop of weak readings in March and April from the calculation.
The strength in manufacturing helped to lift business activity. The survey's flash composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 58.0 early this month from 55.3 in December. While its flash services sector PMI increased to 57.5 from 54.8 in December, the pace of new business growth softened at the start of 2021.
The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, has borne the brunt of the pandemic, with severe disruptions to restaurants, bars and other businesses that attract crowds. COVID-19 has infected more than 24 million people in the United States, with the death toll exceeding 400,000.
The survey's measure of services industry employment fell to a six-month low in early January.
U.S. stocks were trading lower while the dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RECORD LOW INVENTORY
In a separate report on Friday, the National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 0.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.76 million units last month. Economists had forecast sales would decrease 2.0% to a rate of 6.55 million units in December.
Home resales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 22.2% on a year-on-year basis. They totaled 5.64 million in 2020, the most since 2006. Sales in December increased in the Northeast and South. They were unchanged in the Midwest and declined in the West.
Cheaper mortgages and an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as companies allow employees to work from home and schools shift to online classes because of COVID-19 are underpinning demand for housing. About 23.7% of the labor force is working from home. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted lower-wage earners.
But housing supply remains a challenge. While the government reported on Thursday that homebuilding and building permits surged in December to levels last seen in 2006, builders are complaining about higher lumber prices and persistent shortages of labor and land, and they said ""delayed delivery times had put upward pressure on home prices.""
In December, there were a record low 1.07 million previously owned homes on the market, down 16.4% from November and 23% from a year ago, leading to an acceleration in house price inflation. The median existing house price jumped 12.9% from a year ago to $309,800 in December. House prices increased 9% in 2020.
At December's sales pace, it would take a record low 1.9 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.3 months in November and 3.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The IHS Markit flash January composite index of purchasing managers at manufacturers and service providers increased to 58, the second-highest since March 2015, from 55.3 a month earlier, the group reported Friday. Readings above 50 indicate growth.
The improvement stands in stark contrast to the euro area, where the composite gauge contracted for a third-straight month and pointed to a double-dip recession. In Japan, business activity shrank for a 12th month and at the fastest pace since September.
In the U.S., the group’s measure of manufacturing advanced 2 points to 59.1, the highest reading in data back to May 2007. Gauges of production, orders, export demand and employment all strengthened in January.
At the same time, pandemic-related challenges in the supply chain and shortages of some materials continue to drive up input prices. Producers are having some success passing those along to customers.
“Not only have the last two months seen supply shortages develop at a pace not previously seen in the survey’s history, but prices have also risen due to the imbalance of supply and demand,’’ Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. “Input cost inflation consequently also hit a survey high and exerted further upward pressure on average selling prices for goods and services.’’
The IHS Markit’s flash services PMI also improved in January, though new business softened as some states tightened commercial restrictions to combat a resurgent coronavirus. Employment growth was the slowest in six months.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers struggled to recover in December from a partial coronavirus lockdown the previous month, marking a weak end to their worst year on record, while public debt has climbed to its highest since 1962, official data showed on Friday.
The figures suggest Britain's economy had little momentum going into 2021. The government tightened COVID-19 lockdown rules on Jan. 5 to tackle a surge in cases that has kept Britain's death toll the highest in Europe.
A closely watched business survey released on Monday showed the measures contributed to the sharpest fall in economic activity since May, in addition to headwinds from new paperwork for exports to the European Union.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak faces pressure from some in his Conservative Party to show spending is under control when he presents a new budget on March 3, after what is on track to be the heaviest annual borrowing since World War Two.
Sunak has again promised to put the public finances on ""a more sustainable footing"" once the economy begins to recover, after Friday's data showed public borrowing since the start of the financial year in April reached a record 271 billion pounds ($370 billion).
Britain's Office for National Statistics said retail sales volumes rose 0.3% in December, far less than economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 1.2% increase, leaving them just 2.9% higher than a year earlier.
For 2020 as a whole, retail sales were down 1.9%, the biggest calendar-year fall since these records began in 1996. Clothing sales slumped by more than a quarter and spending on fuel dropped by more than a fifth.
Sterling fell slightly against the dollar and the euro following the weaker-than-expected retail numbers.
""With no end in sight for retailers closed in lockdown, many will struggle to survive,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium trade body, calling for more government help for the sector.
Department store Debenhams is among well known names to have collapsed. Administrators said last week its flagship Oxford Street store in central London would close permanently due to the latest COVID restrictions.
RECORD BORROWING
Public sector borrowing for the month of December came in at 34.1 billion pounds, just above Reuters poll forecasts. Total public sector debt had reached 2.132 trillion pounds, equivalent to 99.4% of GDP, the most since 1962.
Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane said on Tuesday government borrowing on this scale was essential to stabilise the economy. He said he did not see a looming debt crisis, predicting interest rates would remain very low for a long time.
""This level of spending may be eye-wateringly large, but it is absolutely necessary,"" said Charlie McCurdy, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation think tank.
December offered a partial respite for Britain's economy, which has seen sharper falls in its official measure of output than any other advanced country, as well as Europe's highest official death toll from COVID-19.
In November, the economy shrank 2.6%, due to a four-week lockdown in England and similar measures in other parts of Britain, although some restrictions had remained in place for retailers in December.
This month the government went further and shut schools as well as all non-essential retailers, which most economists think will lead to the economy contracting in the first quarter.
Flash purchasing managers index (PMI) data on Monday showed manufacturing growth slowed in early January, and services firms suffered a sharp fall in activity and reduced their workforce.
""The steepest loss of jobs was recorded in the hotels, restaurants, travel and leisure sectors, reflecting the new lockdown measures,"" survey publishers IHS Markit said.
Experimental data from the ONS on Thursday showed consumer spending in early January was 35% lower than before the pandemic began in February, although the figures were not seasonally adjusted to reflect the typical post-Christmas lull.
Retail sales have performed better than other areas of consumer spending, with shoppers switching to online stores, where spending surged by 46.1% in 2020.

Excluding the slump in fuel sales, retail sales grew in 2020, albeit by the lowest level since 2011, reflecting extra spending on groceries and household goods by people stuck at home.

LONDON (Reuters) - Economic activity in the euro zone shrank markedly in January as stringent lockdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic hit the bloc's dominant service industry hard.
With hospitality and entertainment venues forced to remain closed across much of the continent, surveys on Friday highlighted sharp contractions in the services industry but also showed manufacturing remained strong as factories largely kept working.
IHS Markit's flash composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to economic health, fell further below the 50 mark separating growth from contraction to 47.5 in January from December's 49.1. A Reuters poll had predicted a fall to 47.6.
""High infection rates are again forcing governments to extend and tighten containment measures,"" said Tomas Dvorak at Oxford Economics.
""The flash PMIs point to a looming contraction in euro zone GDP in Q1. We don't expect any meaningful economic recovery before the pandemic is brought under control.""

Activity in Germany's services sector shrank for a fourth month in a row as a hard lockdown shuttered most non-essential businesses in Europe's biggest economy. Despite slowing to a four-month low, manufacturing remained in expansion territory as exports kept German factories humming.
With hotels and restaurants closed, France's service sector bore the brunt of national coronavirus restrictions and overall activity there shrank more than expected.
In Britain, outside the European Union, a third national lockdown sparked the sharpest drop in business activity since May. A post Brexit shift to a more bureaucratic trading arrangement with the EU also contributed to the decline.

HEADCOUNT, PRICES FALL
A PMI covering the euro zone's dominant service industry dropped to 45.0 from 46.4, exceeding expectations in a Reuters poll that had predicted a steeper fall to 44.5 and still a long way from historic lows at the start of the pandemic.
With activity still in decline and restrictions likely to be in place for some time yet, services firms were forced to chop their charges, with the output price index falling to its lowest reading since June.
That will be disappointing for policymakers at the European Central Bank - who on Thursday left policy unchanged - as uncomfortably low inflation has been a thorn in the ECB's side for years.
Factory activity remained strong and the manufacturing PMI held well above the breakeven level.
But despite strong demand factories again cut headcount, as they have every month since May 2019.
As immunisation programmes are being ramped up after a slow start in Europe survey respondents remained optimistic about the coming year.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's relapse into a third national COVID-19 lockdown has sparked the sharpest drop in business activity since May, with services companies hit hardest, a survey showed on Friday.
A preliminary ""flash"" IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 40.6 in January, down from 50.4 in December.
The drop below the 50 threshold for growth was bigger than any economist forecast in a Reuters poll, which had pointed to a reading of 45.5.
In addition to the latest lockdown, data company IHS Markit said Britain's post-Brexit shift to a more bureaucratic trading arrangement with the European Union had contributed to the decline.
“Services have once again been especially hard hit, but manufacturing has seen growth almost stall, blamed on a cocktail of COVID-19 and Brexit, which has led to increasingly widespread supply delays, rising costs and falling exports,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

Britain is rolling out vaccines faster than many of its peers, which should bode for a swift economic rebound later this year.
Thursday's survey showed companies were upbeat about their business prospects for the year ahead, with optimism hitting a 6-1/2-year high.
The PMI for the services industry, which accounts for the vast bulk of Britain's private sector economy, fell to 38.8 in January from 49.4 in December, its lowest level since May and marking a third month of contraction.
Factories fared much better, despite fading growth in output and a renewed decline in order books. The manufacturing PMI fell to 52.9 in January from 57.5 in December, remaining above the 50 dividing line for growth.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 09:05PM ET</span>","Japan's consumer prices fall at decade-fast pace, add to deflation fears","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices slumped in December at the fastest annual pace in a decade, a sign of intensifying deflationary pressures that sharpen the case for the central bank to come up with better ways to combat the deepening impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Friday's weak data underscores the challenges policymakers face in preventing the spread of the virus without adding to the strain on an economy already suffering from a renewed state of emergency rolled out this month.
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil but excludes fresh food costs, fell 1.0% in December from a year earlier, government data showed, slightly less than a median market forecast for a 1.1% drop.
It was the biggest annual fall since September 2010, when Japan was grappling with grinding deflation and a spike in the yen that dealt a severe blow to the export-reliant economy.
""Consumption is slowing quite sharply so retailers can't raise prices. Japan is certainly facing deflationary pressures,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Analysts, however, are split on whether Japan was heading back towards the two-decade long deflation it endured until 2013, when many companies competed for demand with big discounts.
""I don't think Japan is reverting to deflation as a trend, as price falls aren't necessarily broad-based,"" Tsunoda added.
Still, new state of emergency measures could cripple services spending and prod more firms to cut prices. That, in turn, could stoke public perceptions prices will keep falling - a risk the BOJ flagged on Thursday.
""I don't think the risk of Japan sliding back into deflation is high,"" BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters on Thursday. ""But potential growth may be falling so we need to look at the impact (on prices) carefully.""
The weak price data could affect the BOJ's debate when it examines its framework in March as it aims to make its policy tools more ""sustainable and effective"", some analysts say.
Mounting deflationary pressures would heighten the need for the BOJ to come up with ways to ensure its massive stimulus programme can endure the battle towards achieving its 2% inflation target, prolonged by COVID-19.
Some analysts expect consumer prices to recover over the short-term.
Slumping fuel costs and a government campaign offering discounts for domestic travel were mainly behind the drop in CPI, the data showed. Of the total 523 components of the core index, 242 saw prices rise while those for 220 items fell.
When stripping away the effect of fresh food, energy and the impact of the government's travel discount campaign, consumer prices rose 0.1% in December, government estimates showed.
""While headline inflation dropped to an 11-year low in November, that was due to weaker energy and fresh food inflation. We expect inflation to recover over the coming months,"" said Tom Learmouth, an economist at Capital Economics.

930,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 02:10PM ET</span>","U.S. labor market recovery fading; housing, factories underpin economy","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits decreased modestly last week as the COVID-19 pandemic tears through the nation, raising the risk that the economy shed jobs for a second straight month in January.
Despite the labor market woes, the economy remains anchored by strong manufacturing and housing sectors. Other data on Thursday showed homebuilding and permits for future residential construction surged in December to levels last seen in 2006. Factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated this month, with manufacturers reporting a boom in new orders.
The services sector has borne the brunt of the coronavirus crisis, disproportionately impacting lower-wage earners, who tend to be women and minorities. Addressing the so-called K-shaped recovery, where better-paid workers are doing well while lower-paid workers are losing out, is one of the key challenges confronting President Joe Biden and his new administration.
White House economic advisor Brian Deese said the fragile labor market underscored the urgency for U.S. Congress to act quickly on Biden's $1.9 trillion relief plan to ""get this virus under control, stabilize the economy, and reduce the long-term scarring that will only worsen if bold action isn't taken.""Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 900,000 for the week ended Jan. 16, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 910,000 applications in the latest week. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs 1.4 million people filed claims last week.
Out-of-control coronavirus infections are disrupting operations at businesses like restaurants, gyms and other establishments where crowds tend to gather, reducing hours for many workers and pushing others out of employment. 
Consumers are also hunkering down at home, hurting demand. COVID-19 has infected more than 24 million people, with the death toll exceeding 400,000 since the pandemic started in the United States.
U.S. stocks hovered near record highs. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower. 
Some of the elevation in claims reflects people re-applying for benefits following the government's recent renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14 as part of the nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus. Programs for the self-employed, gig workers as well as those who have exhausted their benefits were also extended.

JOB LOSSES IN JANUARY?
The claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report. Claims were slightly higher between the December and January survey period.
""Another negative print for payrolls in January remains within the realm of possibility,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The economy shed 140,000 jobs in December, the first job losses since April when authorities throughout the country enforced stay-at-home measures to slow the spread of the virus. Retail sales fell for a third straight month in December.
Though jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 127,000 to 5.054 million during the week ending Jan. 9. 
About 16 million people were on unemployment benefits under all programs at the start of the year. The decrease from 18.4 million at the end of 2020 reflected the temporary expiration of government-funded benefits. The economy has recovered 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. 
But housing and manufacturing are bucking the labor market distress. In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said housing starts jumped 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.669 million units in December, the highest level since September 2006. 
Building permits for future homebuilding, which typically lead starts by one to two months, accelerated 4.5% to a rate of 1.709 million units in December, the highest since August 2006. Surging lumber prices and labor and land shortages could, however, slow the housing market momentum.
""Rising material prices, including lumber, are beginning to weigh on builder confidence and reduce housing affordability,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
(GRAPHIC: Housing starts - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbpgyjzmpq/hsbp.png) 
A third report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its business conditions index soared to a reading of 26.5 this month from 9.1 in December. A measure of new orders at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, vaulted to a reading of 30.0 from 1.9 in December. Manufacturing is being boosted by businesses rebuilding inventories.
(GRAPHIC: Philly Fed - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jbyprnmeepe/phillyfed.png) 
Factory employment measures also improved. While manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, they were also able to increase prices for their goods. This mirrored other manufacturing surveys, suggesting inflation could pick up and remain elevated for a while this year. Manufacturers were upbeat about capital investment plans in the six months ahead.

""Inflation is likely moving up and should continue to do so, albeit slowly,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>","U.S. housing starts, building permits accelerate","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding and permits surged in December as historically low mortgage rates supported the housing market, but momentum could slow amid surging lumber prices and a shortage of labor.
Housing starts jumped 5.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.669 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.560 million units in December. Homebuilding increased 5.2% on a year-on-year basis. Starts totaled 1.380 million in 2020, up 7.0% from 2019.
Permits for future homebuilding accelerated 4.5% to a rate of 1.709 million units in December. Permits, which typically lead starts by one to two months, totaled 1.452 million last year, a 4.8% increase from 2019.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, soared 12.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.338 million units. Single-family starts have increased for eight straight months.
Though the housing market and manufacturing remain the economy's stars performers, the relentless COVID-19 pandemic is hurting the availability of labor at construction sites as sick workers stay at home.
A survey on Wednesday showed a dip in confidence among single-family homebuilders in January. Builders complained about ""supply-side constraints related to lumber and other material costs, a lack of affordable lots and labor shortages that delay delivery times and put upward pressure on home prices.""
Softwood lumber prices surged 52.2% on a year-on-year basis in December, according to data from the Labor Department.
The housing market is being underpinned by cheaper mortgages and an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as companies allow employees to work from home and schools shift to online classes because of the pandemic. About 23.7% of the labor force is working from home. Lower-wage earners in the services sector have borne the brunt of the coronavirus crisis.
Single-family building permits raced 7.8% to a rate of 1.226 million units in December. Homebuilding is being supported by lean inventories, especially for previously owned homes.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.79%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Starts for the volatile multi-family segment tumbled 13.6% to a pace of 331,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects fell 3.0% to a pace of 483,000 units.
Rising rental vacancy rates are a challenge for the multi-family housing market. The pandemic has also seen renters moving away from city centers to suburban apartments in search of a more outdoor lifestyle.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers' concerns about shortages of low-wage workers and supplies have risen the most in almost 50 years, a survey showed on Thursday, as they wrestle with COVID-19 disruptions and new customs rules after leaving the European Union.
A measure of how manufacturers feel about their competitiveness relative to EU rivals deteriorated at the fastest pace on record, meanwhile, and companies expected output and orders to decline, the Confederation of British Industry said of its survey results.
""Manufacturers across the board are continuing to battle major headwinds,"" CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said.
A monthly index of new orders for January dropped to -38 from -25 in December, and a quarterly measure of optimism sank to -22 from zero in October.
However, export orders bucked the broader trend, with this balance rising to its least negative since March, though it was still below its long-run average.
""(This) suggests that EU firms are not hesitating to source goods from the UK, despite the extra red tape and rise in haulage costs,"" Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The survey adds to signs that Britain's economy will contract in early 2021, hit by a surge in coronavirus cases and restrictions, and new bureaucracy for trade with the EU. 
Manufacturing accounts for about 10% of Britain's economy.
The much bigger services sector has been hit far harder by social-distancing measures and is also facing new barriers to trade with the EU.
Separately, a new experimental measure of consumer spending indicated that credit and debit card spending in early January slumped to 35% below its level last February, before the pandemic.
The figures - published by the Office for National Statistics using Bank of England data - are not seasonally adjusted, so part of the fall probably reflects a normal drop in spending after Christmas, on top of the impact of new COVID restrictions which closed non-essential retailers this month.
The CBI figures showed many manufacturers reported a rush to build up stocks and complete EU orders in December, before the new customs rules took effect on Jan. 1.
British goods are not subject to tariffs or quotas as they enter the EU, but do face significant new paperwork, adding to costs and delays.
Concern about shortages of materials and components rose by the most since January 1975, which the CBI linked to COVID disruption to international trade and Brexit-linked customs delays.

Concerns about a lack of unskilled workers rose by the most since April 1974. New immigration rules since Jan. 1 limit employers' ability to hire low-paid workers from the EU, at a time when COVID has led to increased staff absence.

Investing.com --The number of people claiming jobless benefits in the U.S. fell last week but remained at historically high levels as the Covid-19 pandemic continued to take its toll.
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims fell to 900,000 from 926,000 the week before – a figure that itself was revised downward from an initial estimate of 965,000.
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-month lag, also fell to 5.054 million, from a downwardly-revised 5.181 million. That confounded expectations for an increase to around 5.4 million."
934,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 09:35PM ET</span>",Japan's exports post first annual gain in two years in December,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose for the first time in two years in December, driven by shipments to China, government data showed, offering a glimmer of hope for policymakers counting on an export-led recovery amid a resurgence of the coronavirus.
A recovery in exports may ease the risk of a double-dip recession, while the Bank of Japan is seen upgrading its growth forecast for next fiscal year at its rate review ending Thursday. The central bank is expected to stand pat on policy.
Still, the pace of recovery in Japan's shipments paled in comparison with neighbouring export hubs such as China, Taiwan and South Korea, all of which saw a double-digit growth led by global demand for chip and tech products.
The Ministry of Finance data out on Thursday showed Japan's exports rose 2.0% in December from a year earlier, slightly below a 2.4% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll but up from a 4.2% decline in the previous month.
It marked the first annual increase since November 2018.
In a worrying sign, however, car exports fell 4.2% in the year to December, with shipments to the European Union plunging 32.2%. The fall comes as carmakers like  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd are set to cut vehicle production this month due to a shortage of semiconductors as demand rebounds from the coronavirus crisis.
For the full year 2020, Japan's car exports fell 20% -- the biggest decline since shipments more than halved during the 2009 global financial crisis -- making it the main culprit behind overall yearly export decline of 11.1%, the data showed.
""Exports are stalling due to restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus infections in Europe and America,"" said Yutaro Suzuki, economist at Daiwa Institute of Research. ""A supply crunch among automakers caused by a shortage of chips could weigh on exports.""
By region, exports to China -- Japan's largest trading partner -- grew 10.2% in the year to December, led by shipments of plastic, nonferrous metals and other raw materials.
Shipments to the United States -- a key market for Japanese goods such as cars and electronics -- dropped 0.7% year-on-year in December, dragged down by airplanes and chip-making equipment.
Exports to Asia, which accounts for more than half of Japanese shipments, advanced 6.1%, while shipments to the European Union decline 1.6%. 
Imports fell 11.6% in the year to December, roughly in line with the median estimate, bringing a trade surplus of 751 billion yen ($7.25 billion).

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's annual inflation rate slowed to 0.7% in December from 1.0% the previous month amid a new round of COVID-19 lockdowns and declining costs of airplane tickets, clothing and footwear, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.
Headline inflation was below analyst expectations for inflation to remain at November's 1.0% rate. Consumer prices fell 0.2% on the month, as did the cost of food.
""It's an unexpected slowdown in inflation,"" said Royce Mendes, a senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. ""Looking at the details, I don't think it much changes the thinking at the Bank of Canada.""
The Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.25% on Wednesday and reiterated it did not expect inflation to return sustainably to its 2% target until 2023.
However, the central bank said COVID-19 vaccines had helped brighten the outlook.
""The arrival of effective vaccines combined with further fiscal and monetary policy support have boosted the medium-term outlook for growth,"" the bank said.
The Canadian dollar was trading 0.8% higher at 1.2635 to the greenback, or 79.15 U.S. cents, after the rate announcement.
Two of the three core measures of inflation fell in December. The common measure, which the Bank says is the best gauge of the economy's underperformance, was unchanged at 1.8%.
Both Ontario and Quebec, Canada's most populous provinces, imposed tighter health restrictions in December as the novel coronavirus spread.
Canada reported 4,679 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, and has seen more than 18,000 total deaths since the start of the pandemic.
""It should be expected there would be slack in the economy given the persistent shutdowns related to COVID,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities. ""It's nonetheless... a touch more concerning to see the move in the core measures than it is in the headline measures.""

The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index slipped to a reading of 83 this month from 86. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the index would be unchanged at 86. A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable than poor. The index hit an all-time high of 90 in November.
""Despite robust housing demand and low mortgage rates, buyers are facing a dearth of new homes on the market, which is exacerbating affordability problems,"" said NAHB chairman Chuck Fowke. ""Builders are grappling with supply-side constraints related to lumber and other material costs, a lack of affordable lots and labor shortages that delay delivery times and put upward pressure on home prices.""
Demand for housing is being driven by cheaper mortgages and an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low density areas as companies allow employees to work from home and schools shift to online classes because of the coronavirus pandemic. About 23.7% of the labor force is working from home.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases is also disrupting labor at construction sites. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.79%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).

937,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 04:00AM ET</span>",UK inflation starts climb as effects of COVID and Brexit combine,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation gathered speed in December, starting what is expected to be a climb this year as pandemic-fighting measures, Brexit and a recovery in the economy combine to push up costs for consumers and businesses.
Consumer prices rose 0.6% in annual terms after a 0.3% increase in November, the Office for National Statistics said.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a rate of 0.5%.
A temporary easing of COVID-19 travel restrictions helped to push up air and sea fares while a rise in global oil prices made fuel more expensive and the price of clothes also rose.
Inflation has been below the Bank of England's 2% target since mid-2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic pushed it close to zero as the economy tanked.
But it is likely to rise as the impact of value-added tax cuts and other emergency pandemic measures fade from the statistical comparisons, and because of Britain's new, less open trading relationship with the European Union.
""We are going to be talking a lot more about inflation in 2021 than we did 2020,"" said Jeremy Thomson-Cook, an economist at foreign exchange company Equals Group. ""Both Brexit and COVID-19 are factors that have caused substantial pain for businesses and their supply chains.""
A Reuters poll of economists published last week showed inflation is likely to rise to close to the BoE's 2% target by the end of this year, and some like Capital Economics think it will peak at 2.5%. [ECILT/GB]
But economists see little pressure on the BoE to start raising interest rates from their all-time low any time soon with Britain's economy still about 10% smaller than before the pandemic.
Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said a rise in unemployment after the end of the government's job protection scheme - scheduled for April - was likely to keep a lid on domestic inflation pressures.
""The (BoE) will not need to even talk about the prospect of interest rates rising in future within the next two years,"" Tombs said.
The ONS said air and sea fare prices rose last month, making transport services the biggest contributor to the increase in inflation during December. 
Prices at petrol pumps rose by 1.5 pence per litre.
Clothing and footwear prices - which rose last month, unlike in December 2019 - also contributed to higher inflation.

The ONS said factory gate prices fell last month by the least in annual terms since March, down 0.4%, and the measure for core output prices rose by the most since September 2019, up 1.2%.

LONDON (Reuters) - Business volumes in UK financial services grew for the first time in two years during the final quarter of 2020 when firms shed staff and remote working in the pandemic spurred reviews of office space, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The latest Financial Services Survey published by employers' body CBI and compiled by consultants PwC, was completed before a third lockdown was introduced in England from January.
""Unfortunately, the health and economic picture has sadly deteriorated since with restrictions tightening again,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI.
A trade deal with the European Union came into effect on Jan. 1 but does not cover financial services, which is being handled separately by Brussels under its ""equivalence"" system.
The EU was the City of London's biggest customer.
""Meanwhile, work must continue on using existing pathways with the UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement to reach better outcomes for the financial services, particularly on equivalence,"" Newton-Smith said.
Firms expect business volumes to grow at a slightly quicker rate in the first three months of 2021, the survey said.
They also expect to cut headcount further this year, with remote working prompting them to consider redefining, reconfiguring or cutting existing office space.
Many financial firms in London have opened hubs in the EU as they don't expect the bloc to grant much direct access under equivalence.

The figure compared with 6.3% in the September-November period and was the highest since the last quarter of 2004 when unemployment hit 6.6%.
The underemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.4% in the two three-month rolling periods. The number of unemployed rose by about 1,500 people to 245,800 in the three months ended in December.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy picked up speed in the fourth quarter, with growth beating expectations as it ended a rough coronavirus-striken 2020 in remarkably good shape and remained poised to expand further this year even as the global pandemic rages unabated.
Gross domestic product grew 2.3% in 2020, official data showed on Monday, making China the only major economy in the world to avoid a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. And China is expected to continue to power ahead of its peers this year, with GDP set to expand at the fastest pace in a decade at 8.4%, according to a Reuters poll.
The world's second-largest economy has surprised many with the speed of its recovery from the coronavirus jolt, especially as policymakers have also had to navigate tense U.S.-China relations on trade and other fronts.
Beijing's strict virus curbs enabled it to largely contain the COVID-19 outbreak much quicker than most countries, while government-led policy stimulus and local manufacturers stepping up production to supply goods to many countries crippled by the pandemic have also helped fire up momentum.
GDP expanded 6.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, quicker than the 6.1% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed the third quarter's solid 4.9% growth.
""The higher-than-expected GDP number indicates that growth has stepped into the expansionary zone, although some sectors remain in recovery,"" said Xing Zhaopeng, economist at ANZ in Shanghai.
""Policy exiting will pose counter-cyclical pressures on 2021 growth.""
Backed by the strict virus containment measures and policy stimulus, the economy has recovered steadily from a steep 6.8% slump in the first three months of 2020, when an outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan turned into a full-blown epidemic.
EXPORTS ENGINE REVS UP
Asia's economic powerhouse has been fuelled by a surprisingly resilient export sector, but China's consumption - a key driver of growth - has lagged expectations amid fears of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.
Data last week showed Chinese exports grew by more than expected in December, as coronavirus disruptions around the world fuelled demand for Chinese goods even as a stronger yuan made exports more expensive for overseas buyers.
Yet, underscoring the massive COVID-19 impact worldwide, China's 2020 GDP growth marked its weakest pace since 1976, the final year of the decade-long Cultural Revolution that wrecked the economy.
Overall, the slew of brightening economic data has reduced the need for more monetary easing this year, leading the central bank to scale back some policy support, sources told Reuters, but there would be no abrupt shift in policy direction, according to top policymakers.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 2.6% in October-December, the bureau said, compared with expectations for a 3.2% rise and an upwardly revised 3.0 gain in the previous quarter.
Highlighting the weakness in consumption, retail sales fell 3.9% last year, marking the first contraction since 1968, records from NBS showed. Growth in retail sales in December missed analyst forecasts and eased to 4.6% from November's 5.0%, as sales of garments, cosmetics, telecoms and autos slowed.
However, China's vast manufacturing sector continued to gain momentum, with industrial output rising at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.3% last month from a year ago, hitting the highest since March 2019.
LINGERING RISKS IN 2021
Ning Jizhe, head of China's statistics bureau, told a briefing that there would be many favourable conditions to sustain China's economic recovery in 2021, citing the country's large market and resilient supply chains.
This year marks the start of China's 14th five-year plan, which policymakers see as vital for steering the economy past the so-called ""middle income trap"".
China still faces many challenges, not least the tensions between Beijing and Washington and how they would play out under the new U.S. administration led by President-elect Joe Biden. As well, rising labour costs, the aging population, and a recent spike in credit defaults add to risks for an economy that is still trying to reduce a mountain of debt.
""We should be alert to the following problems in 2021: first the imbalance of economic recovery. Compared with investment and export, consumption is weak as a whole and has yet to return to normal levels,"" said Wang Jun, Beijing-based chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
The second problem, Wang said, is a possible rapid slowdown in credit growth.
The central bank is poised to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged in coming months while steering a steady slowdown in credit expansion in 2021, policy sources have said.
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank, sees the macro leverage ratio jumping by about 30 percentage points in 2020 to over 270%.
While this year's predicted growth rate of over 8% would be the strongest in a decade, led by an expected double-digit expansion in the first quarter, it is rendered less impressive coming off the low base set in pandemic-stricken 2020.
Some analysts also cautioned that a recent rebound in COVID-19 cases in the northeast of the country could impact activity and consumption in the run-up to next month's long Lunar New Year holidays.
""Control of people-flows has started, so the risk of a widespread outbreak of Covid should be small,"" said Iris Pang, ING's chief China economist.

""But the risk of a technology war between China and some economies remains if the U.S. does not remove some measures.""

Investing.com – The Chinese economy reported growth in 2020, as it controlled the COVID-19 outbreak in the country and positioned itself as the only major country to report economic growth.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics released earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 7.3% year-on-year in December, above the 6.9% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, and the 7% growth seen in November, according to data released earlier in the day.
The data also showed that GDP rose 6.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, above the forecast 6.1% growth and the 4.9% growth in the third quarter. However, the GDP grew 2.6% quarter-on-quarter, below the forecast 3.2% and the 2.7% growth seen during the previous quarter.
Fiscal and monetary stimulus from the government that boosted investment in infrastructure and real estate powered early recovery. Chinese exports such as medical equipment and work-from-home devices also saw strong overseas demand as the COVID-19 outbreak was brought under control and factories resumed production. This demand is expected to remain strong, with lockdowns and restrictive measures still in place in many countries.
Some investors struck an optimistic note.
“The quarter really seems to have shown the economy ended the year on a strong note, manufacturing is doing well,” CCB International Holdings Ltd. head of macro research Cui Li told Bloomberg.
Economists widely expect China’s GDP to expand 8.2% in 2021, continuing to outpace global peers, even as other large economies begin their recoveries as COVID-19 vaccinations are rolled out.
However, China has recently seen cooler-than-expected weather and a resurgent outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the northeastern part of the country. The National Health Commission reported 109 new COVID-19 cases for Jan. 17.
“The Chinese economy accelerated to a strong finish to 2020, though challenges at the start of 2021 could put a damper on growth,” Bloomberg chief Asia economist Chang Shu said."

That expansion was boosted by 6.5% growth in the final quarter of 2020 from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said Monday, marking a return to pre-pandemic growth rates. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted 6.2% growth for the quarter and 2.1% for the full year.
The recovery was aided early on by fiscal and monetary stimulus that boosted investment in infrastructure and real estate. Once China had virus cases under control and factories were able to resume production, growth was fueled by strong overseas consumer demand for Chinese exports, especially medical equipment and work-from-home devices.
Emerging from the pandemic larger than when it started is a capstone to a dramatic year for the world’s second-largest economy, which began 2020 with a historic first-quarter slump when the coronavirus lockdowns brought most activity to a halt.
With global output likely contracting 4.2% last year, China’s gains mean it increased its share of the world economy to 14.5%, according to World Bank estimates, compared with 22% for the U.S. Based on projections from the International Monetary Fund, China will now overtake the U.S. by 2028, two years earlier than previously predicted, according to  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.
Economists expect China’s GDP will expand 8.2% this year, continuing to outpace global peers, even as other large economies begin to recover with vaccines being rolled out.
The ongoing recovery in 2021 will depend on whether China can prevent a large-scale spread of virus infections, and on whether it can pass the baton of spending from local governments and large state companies to smaller businesses and consumers. Household spending and investment by manufacturing companies has lagged overall growth in 2020.
An increasingly tense trade relationship with the U.S. could also weigh on the outlook. In his final weeks in office, President Donald Trump has tightened restrictions on Chinese businesses to curb the nation’s dominance in high-tech industries, roiling financial markets. It’s still unclear how the incoming administration under Joe Biden will navigate those issues.
Global demand for Chinese-made goods is expected to remain strong as the pandemic continues to keep large parts of the world’s population locked down. Already the top exporter, the value of China’s goods shipments increased 3.6% in 2020, according to official data. Imports declined 1.1%, resulting in a $535 billion annual trade surplus, the highest since 2015.
The fiscal and monetary stimulus to support the economy through the pandemic has been accompanied by a surge in debt, a development that authorities are now seeking to address as the recovery takes hold. At a December meeting to lay out economic goals for 2021, the ruling Communist Party signaled that stimulus would be gradually withdrawn, although it would avoid any “sharp turns” in policy.

943,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2021 08:20PM ET</span>","Japan manufacturers' sentiment stabilises in Jan, services weaken: Reuters Tankan","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Sentiment among Japanese manufacturers stabilised in January to the least pessimistic in more than a year from the impact of COVID-19, but service firms grew gloomier just as new lockdowns hit most of the population, the Reuters Tankan poll found. 
Manufacturers in the world's third-biggest economy were the least pessimistic since July 2019, though the outlook, especially for services, is clouded by a pandemic state of emergency covering Tokyo and other population centres through Feb. 7.
Driving the improvement for manufacturers were upbeat views in the chemical, metal products and electric machinery sub-sectors, according to the monthly Reuters poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
""The car market is rapidly recovering, especially in China, and demand for electronic parts is growing,"" a manager at a electric machinery maker wrote in the survey of 482 large and midsize nonfinancial firms, in which 253 responded anonymously.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers rose to minus 1 from minus 9 in the previous month, while the service-sector index fell to minus 11 from minus 4 in December, according to the Dec. 24-Jan. 13 survey.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means pessimists outnumber optimists.
A manager at a chemical producer said business has been recovering since September in line with a recovery in broader market conditions.
Japan's economy surged an annualised 22.9% in the third quarter, rebounding from its deepest postwar slump in the July-September period when the pandemic crushed economic activity.
The government had already committed to spending $3 trillion to bolster the economy before Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga this month announced a second state of emergency, which now covers Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and other areas accounting for 55% of Japan's population.
The Tankan survey showed overall sentiment for the manufacturing sector was poised to fall again, with business confidence expected to edge down to minus 2 in April, despite an expected increase in the mood among chemical firms.
Sentiment in the service industry was forecast to improve slightly to minus 9, with companies highlighting the COVID-19 resurgence as a major headwind.
""Customer numbers have declined significantly in line with the spread of coronavirus infections,"" said a manager at a retailer.

Some 80,700 jobs that allowed remote working were advertised in November, up from 26,600 in November 2019, recruiters New Street Consulting Group said, based on industry data provided by analysts Emsi.
Official data showed 547,000 job vacancies in Britain in the three months to November, down almost a third on a year earlier.
For now, it is unclear how many remote roles will return to being office-based once the pandemic is over.
""There has been a trend in recent years to invest more in the workplace, to make it somewhere where staff would want to spend time. It will be quite a revolution if that trend doesn't eventually reassert itself,"" said Natalie Douglass, a director at New Street Consulting Group.

""However, we are certainly going to see a more hybrid workforce with working from home an option for at least some of their staff,"" she added.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment dipped in early January as Americans reacted to the assault on the U.S. Capitol and a relentless surge in COVID-19 infections and deaths, the University of Michigan said on Friday in a report that also showed a deep partisan divide in views on the economy and outlook.
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dropped to 79.2 early this month from a final reading of 80.7 in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would be little changed at 80.
""Consumer sentiment posted trivial declines in early January despite the horrendous rise in COVID-19 deaths, the insurrection, and the impeachment of Trump,"" University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers Chief Economist Richard Curtin said in a statement.
(GRAPHIC: Shifting tides of consumer sentiment by party - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/SENTIMENT/bdwpkydorpm/chart.png)
The survey period covered the earliest days in January, including Jan. 6, when thousands of angry supporters of Donald Trump stormed the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying Democrat Joe Biden's victory over the Republican president in the Nov. 3, 2020, election. Trump, who leaves office on Jan. 20, has subsequently been impeached for inciting the crowd to violence.
The report revealed a chasm in economic sentiment between Republicans and Democrats.
Even as the survey's overall reading of sentiment dipped modestly, it plummeted to a six-and-a-half-year low among Republicans while surging to a four-year high among Democrats.
(GRAPHIC: Expectations have swung after both recent elections - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/SENTIMENT/dgkplkxmxvb/chart.png)
In both cases, the swings were driven by each group's perceptions of the economic outlook, darkening among Republicans to pre-Trump administration levels and brightening among Democrats to levels registered in the final months of Barack Obama's presidency.
The magnitude of the swing in expectations by party affiliation in the last six months of 2016 and 2020 were nearly identical at around 74 points, Curtin noted.
""The Trump and Biden partisan gaps in expectations are too extreme to be justified by economic fundamentals,"" Curtin said. ""Rather, the partisan gaps are rooted in sharply different policy preferences, with one side favoring economic growth and efficiency, and the other side giving top priority to greater equity and fairness in the distribution of income and wealth.""
On COVID-19, the survey found some optimism around the nascent rollout of vaccines as helping limit the decline in overall sentiment. ""Importantly, COVID's threats to physical and mental health were seen in January as more important than its financial repercussions.""

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the trade surplus of the 19 countries sharing the euro with the rest of the world was 25.8 billion euros in November, up from 20.2 billion a year earlier.
Though both exports and imports fell year-on-year, imports declined 4.2% while exports only 1.0%, Eurostat said.
The biggest changes in the trade balance in the January-November period were with energy exporter Russia, where the European Union's trade deficit narrowed to 13.8 billion euros from 52.1 billion in the same period of 2019.

With Turkey, the EU swung to a 6.2 billion euro trade surplus in the first 11 months of 2020 from a 2.4 billion euro deficit the year before. The EU also improved its trade balances with South Korea, Japan, Norway, and India.

947,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>",COVID-19 pressures U.S. retail sales; manufacturing shines,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales fell for a third straight month in December as renewed measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 triggered job losses, further evidence that the wounded economy lost considerable speed at the end of 2020.
The downturn in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Friday is, however, unlikely to push the economy back into recession, with other data showing production at factories accelerating last month. There is also cautious optimism that nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief provided by the government at the end of December will offer a backstop.
The ebbing economic momentum, which appears to have spilled over into the new year, could persuade the U.S. Congress to agree to President-elect Joe Biden's ambitious $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, which includes bolstering the response to the virus and direct relief to households and small businesses.
""That should make Congress more willing to deal on Biden's wish list,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""Critical to Biden's story is that the virus itself is creating the downturn, not any fundamental problems with the economy, and this is what needs to be done to address it.""
Retail sales dropped 0.7% last month. Data for November was revised down to show sales tumbling 1.4% instead of 1.1% as previously reported. Sales rose 2.9% on a year-on-year basis.
The monthly decline in sales was led by a 4.5% plunge at restaurants and bars after many authorities banned indoor dining over the holiday season. Online sales tumbled 5.8%. Receipts at electronics and appliance stores dropped 4.9%.
Consumers also cut back spending at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores as well as beverage stores. That offset a 1.9% rebound in sales at auto dealerships and a 2.4% increase in receipts at clothing stores. There were also gains in sales at building material stores as well as health and personal care outlets.
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales tumbled 1.9% last month after a downwardly revised 1.1% decline in November. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have decreased 0.5% in November.
""There were plenty of culprits ruining the holiday spirit, including a frightening health situation, rising layoffs, and a looming lapse in jobless benefits,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Biden's ambitious fiscal agenda could juice up household spending during the delicate vaccine rollout phase.""
Optimism over the distribution of vaccines limited a decline in consumer sentiment in early January after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop lawmakers from certifying Biden's victory in the Nov. 3 election. In a second report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index slipped to 79.2 from a final reading of 80.7 in December.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
JOB LOSSES
The steep declines in core retail sales prompted economists to cut their consumer spending and GDP growth estimates for the fourth quarter. The government reported last week that the economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. Further job losses are likely in January as new claims for unemployment benefits surged in the first week of the month.
Rampant coronavirus infections and delays by the government to approve more money to help businesses and the unemployed are behind the loss of economic momentum. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 5% annualized rate, largely reflecting an inventory build, which is boosting manufacturing.
The economy grew at a 33.4% rate in the third quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the April-June quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.
In a third report on Friday, the Federal Reserve said manufacturing production rose 0.9% last month after advancing 0.8% in November. That was the eighth straight monthly gain in factory production. Manufacturing is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services.
Production at factories increased at a 11.2% rate in the fourth quarter.
""Manufacturing is clearly weathering this wave of confirmed COVID-19 cases better than occurred earlier this year,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Manufacturers are busy, as there is a need to rebuild inventories and demand for consumer goods remains strong, for now.""
A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed business inventories increased 0.5% in November.
Though economic growth is slowing, inflation is stirring, with a fifth report from the Labor Department showing the producer price index for final demand increased 0.3% in December after nudging up 0.1% in November.

""Additional government spending as well as a fuller reopening of the economy that will bring back demand are all factors that will boost inflation over coming months,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
 "
948,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 10:30AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories rise in November,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories increased in November, supporting expectations that inventory investment was likely the main driver of economic growth in the fourth quarter.
Business inventories rose 0.5% in November after increasing 0.8% in October, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. November's increase was in line with economists' expectations. Inventories fell 3.2% on a year-on-year basis in November.
Retail inventories rose 0.7% in November as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.9% increase in October. Motor vehicle inventories jumped 1.9% instead of 1.5% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, gained 0.2% instead of 0.3% as estimated last month.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic. That has helped to underpin manufacturing. Inventory accumulation is expected to blunt some of the drag on GDP from a widening trade deficit, which hit a more than 14-year high in November.
The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Inventories added to GDP growth in the third quarter after being a drag for five straight quarters.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate because of the outbreak in coronavirus infections and the largely expired fiscal stimulus.
Wholesale inventories were unchanged in November. Stocks at manufacturers rose 0.7%.

Business sales slipped 0.1% in November after accelerating 0.9% in October. At November's sales pace, it would take 1.32 months for businesses to clear shelves, unchanged from October.

The industry group said actual sales, not seasonally adjusted, rose 47.2% from a year earlier, while the group's Home Price Index was up 13.0% on a year-over-year basis and up 1.5% from November.
The record-breaking December capped off a record year for Canadian real estate, with more than 550,000 homes trading hands despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which some economists and real estate experts had feared would lead to a housing crash.
""Despite all the challenges, 2020 was a record year for Canadian resale housing activity,"" Costa Poulopoulos, chair of CREA, said in a statement, adding that the momentum was continuing into 2021.
The industry group noted that the number of homes listed for sale in Canada on Jan. 1 was the lowest on record, which coupled with new restrictions amid a surge in COVID-19 cases and lockdowns, pointed to further supply tightness in 2021.
""So we have record-high demand and record-low supply to start the year. How that plays out in the sales and price data will depend on how many homes become available to buy in the months ahead,"" said Shaun Cathcart, senior economist with CREA.
Regionally, the markets with the largest year-over-year price gains - up more than 30% - were in smaller Ontario towns and cottage communities outside of Toronto. Followed by satellite cities around Toronto.

Homes in British Columbia and the prairie provinces were up by 5% to 10% on the year, with Alberta home prices gaining less than 3%.

Manufacturing production rose 0.9% last month after advancing 0.8% in November, the Federal Reserve said on Friday. That was the eighth straight monthly gain in factory production. Manufacturing is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output rising 0.5% in December. A survey last this month showed suppliers struggling to deliver materials to manufacturers, labor and transportation constraints because of the coronavirus.
Motor vehicles and parts output declined 1.6% in December. Excluding autos, manufacturing output increased 1.1%. 
Production at factories increased at a 11.2% annualized rate in the fourth quarter.
The strength in manufacturing output combined with a 6.2% surge utilities and 1.6% jump in mining to boost industrial production by 1.6% in December. That followed a 0.5% gain in November. Industrial production increased at a 8.4% rate in the fourth quarter.
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.7 percentage points to 73.4% in December. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector increased 1.1 percentage points to 74.5%. It is 5.3 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average.

Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy — how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.

The producer price index for final demand increased 0.3% last month after nudging up 0.1% in November, the Labor Department said on Friday. In the 12 months through December, the PPI rose 0.8%, matching November's gain.
A 1.1% increase in the cost of goods accounted for last month's rise in the PPI. Prices for services dipped 0.1%.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI rising 0.4% in December and gaining 0.8% on a year-on-year basis.
The government this week reported solid increases in both consumer and import prices in December. Economists expect inflation to accelerate in the months ahead as the government provides more money to stimulate the economy, and weak prices early in the coronavirus crisis fall out of the calculations.
But any inflation spark will probably be temporary against the backdrop of ample slack in the labor market, with at least 18.4 million Americans on unemployment benefits.
The Federal Reserve has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot the U.S. central bank's 2% target.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices increased 0.4%. The so-called core PPI inched up 0.1% in November. In the 12 months through November, the core PPI gained 1.1% after rising 0.9% in November.
Energy prices jumped 5.5% last month after advancing 1.2% in November. Wholesale food prices slipped 0.1%. Core goods prices increased 0.5%. Margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, dropped 0.8%. Healthcare costs edged up 0.1%, while portfolio fees jumped 1.7%.

952,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 03:25AM ET</span>",UK economy pushed into reverse by November lockdown,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy shrank in November for the first time since the initial COVID-19 lockdown last spring, hit by a tightening of social-distancing rules. 
The 2.6% monthly decline was much smaller than most analysts expected - a Reuters poll had pointed to a 5.7% contraction - but several economists said Britain was still likely to suffer a double-dip recession.
Britain's economy, which shrank more sharply than any other major advanced economy in the first half of 2020, is now 8.5% smaller than it was before the start of the coronavirus pandemic in February.
""It's clear things will get harder before they get better and today's figures highlight the scale of the challenge we face,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
But the roll-out of vaccines in Britain - which has been faster than elsewhere in Europe - was a reason to be hopeful, Sunak said.
Several economists warned that Britain was still on course for renewed recession, with the economy likely to shrink in both the final quarter of 2020 and the first three months of 2021.
""A third lockdown means that a double-dip recession in the first quarter of this  year may be inevitable, particularly if the current post-Brexit disruption persists through the quarter,"" said Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce.
The scale of the hit to the economy in November was much smaller than in the first lockdown last year, something the Office for National Statistics attributed to businesses adjusting to social-distancing rules and schools remaining open.
But with a third, tougher lockdown now in place, and the impact of the country's new, less open trading relationship with the European Union also a drag on business, the country is facing major challenges in early 2021.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said this week that it was too soon to say if further stimulus would be needed after the central bank ramped up its bond-buying programme to almost 900 billion pounds ($1.23 trillion) in November. 
Friday's data showed Britain's economy in November was 8.9% smaller than a year earlier, a smaller drop than the 12.1% fall forecast in a Reuters poll. In October the economy had been 6.8% smaller than a year before.
At its lowest point in April, when many businesses closed temporarily, output was a record 25% below its year-ago level.
November's downturn was led by the services sector, where output fell 3.4% from October as pubs, restaurants, non-essential shops and many other consumer services businesses had to shut as part of a four-week lockdown in England and similar measures in other parts of the United Kingdom. 
Part of the scale of the hit to Britain's economy in 2020 reflects a decision by the ONS to take account of disruption to routine medical care and schooling due to COVID-19, an approach which not all countries' statistics agencies have taken.
BoE Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent has estimated this factor accounted for a quarter of the almost 9% annual drop in output recorded for the third quarter of 2020.

Next week's key data includes core consumer inflation, which is expected to show the fastest pace of decline in over a decade, further adding to deflation fears as a renewed state of emergency in Tokyo and some other areas due to the pandemic are likely to dent consumer spending. 
Exports likely rose 2.4% in December from a year earlier, which would be the first increase since November 2018, the poll of 17 economists showed.
Imports were forecast to have fallen 14.0% in December from a year earlier, which would result in a trade surplus of 942.8 billion yen ($9.09 billion).
""Exports are recovering thanks to a pick up in overseas economies,"" said Kenta Maruyama, an economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Research and Consulting.
""But the pace of recovery will likely slow down as they have come to the level before the pandemic and the virus cases are surging in Europe and other parts of the world.""
The finance ministry announces trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Thursday (2350 GMT Wednesday).
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is expected to have fallen 1.1% in December from a year earlier due to energy price falls and weak consumer spending, the poll showed.
That would the fastest pace of year-on-year drop since September 2010, when the index also fell 1.1%.
The government releases core CPI at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.
The poll also showed the Bank of Japan is expected to keep its policy interest rate at minus 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% at its policy meeting on Jan. 20-21.

954,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 03:05PM ET</span>","U.S. weekly jobless claims jump on COVID-19, renewed supplementary payments","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits surged last week, confirming a weakening in labor market conditions as a worsening COVID-19 pandemic disrupts operations at restaurants and other businesses.
The larger-than-expected increase in weekly unemployment claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was seen by some economists as driven by the recent renewal of supplemental jobless benefits, but nonetheless raised the risk of further job losses in January after nonfarm payrolls slumped in December for the first time in eight months.
A stalling labor market recovery could put pressure on the incoming Biden administration for a bigger relief package. Joe Biden will take over from President Donald Trump next Wednesday. He is expected to propose stimulus of as much as $2 trillion on Thursday. The government approved nearly $900 billion in additional relief at the end of December.
""The economy clearly needs additional support from Washington because right now rising jobless claims tells us the labor market recovery has stalled and the direction is full-tilt down,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 181,000 to a seasonally adjusted 965,000 for the week ended Jan. 9, the highest since late August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 795,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims shot up 231,335 to 1.151 million last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs 1.4 million people filed claims last week.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Thursday the economy was far from the U.S. central bank's inflation and employment goals. Powell said in a web symposium with Princeton University that it was too soon for the Fed to talk about changing its monthly bond purchases, part of an array of measures it has deployed to help the economy. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower. 
STRICTER MEASURES
The surge in claims last week also likely reflected people re-applying for benefits following the government's renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14 as part of the latest stimulus package. Government-funded programs for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their benefits were also extended.
""Not all individuals eligible for unemployment assistance actually claim benefits, and the supplementary payments add an incentive to file for benefits,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Authorities in many states have banned indoor dining to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The economy shed jobs in December for the first time in eight months. 
The Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide in early January showed on Wednesday that ""contacts in the leisure and hospitality sectors reported renewed employment cuts due to stricter containment measures.""
The central bank also noted that the resurgence in the coronavirus was causing staff shortages in the manufacturing, construction and transportations sectors. The virus has infected more than 22.5 million people in the United States and killed over 376,188, the most of any country.
Though jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Economists say it could take several years for the labor market to recover from the pandemic.
The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 199,000 to 5.271 million during the week ending Jan. 2. At least 18.4 million were on unemployment benefits on all programs in late December.
Labor market stress could curb inflation amid signs of rising price pressures. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said import prices jumped 0.9% in December after rising 0.2% in November. Import prices were boosted by higher prices for energy products and recent dollar weakness.
Economists had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, accelerating 0.7% in December. In the 12 months through December, import prices slipped 0.3% after dropping 1.0% in November.
""Prices are filtering upward, but with the labor market no longer improving, inflation is not likely to affect the economy,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday business applications dropped 28.5% to a seasonally adjusted 1.115 million last quarter. All four regions recorded a decrease, with steep declines in the Midwest, South and West. 
The coronavirus crisis has worsened, with restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses suffering the most. The economy has recovered 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April, when the crisis started in the United States.
At least 18.4 million Americans are on unemployment benefits. Economists expect employment will return to its pre-pandemic level in the 2023.

The Commerce Department's Census Bureau, which compiles the business formation data, said the report will no longer be released on a quarterly basis. Instead, reports will be published monthly starting with January data, which will be released on Feb. 10.

The Labor Department said on Thursday import prices jumped 0.9% last month after rising 0.2% in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, accelerating 0.7% in December. 
In the 12 months through December, import prices slipped 0.3% after dropping 1.0% in November.
Fuel prices shot up 7.8% after increasing 4.8% in November. Imported food prices slipped 0.2%. Excluding fuels and foods, import prices increased 0.4% after being unchanged in November.
The so-called core import prices are rising following the dollar's recent weakness against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners and could keep inflation supported this year. The government reported on Wednesday that consumer prices increased 0.4% in December.
Last month, the cost of goods imported from China rose 0.3% after gaining 0.2% in November. Prices for imported capital goods were unchanged for a third straight month. The cost of imported motor vehicles was also unchanged. But prices for consumer goods excluding autos gained 0.1%.

The report also showed export prices surged 1.1% in December rising 0.7% in November. Prices for agricultural exports increased 0.6% while nonagricultural exports jumped 1.3%. Export prices rose 0.2% on a year-on-year basis in December. That was the first annual increase since last January and followed a 1.1% decrease in November.

957,By Investing.com,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>",Initial Jobless Claims Hit 5-Month High as Pandemic Saps Labor Market Strength,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Initial claims for jobless benefits surged last week to their highest level in five months as the restrictive measures put in place around the country to stop the Covid-19 pandemic continued to take their toll on the U.S. labor market.
The Labor Department said 965,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, up from 784,000 and well above the 795,000 expected. 
The number of continuing claims under regular state programs also rose by some 200,000 to 5.27 million. A further 13 million are claiming unemployment benefits under other programs, chiefly the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation scheme. 
The figures from the last two weeks have been distorted by volatility in the reports filed by Illinois, which showed a sharp and uncharacteristic drop last week, only to post more claims than any other state this week. However, even allowing for that, the increase in claims is clearly bigger than expected, and suggests a further weakening in conditions since the cut-off date for December's employment report. 
The monthly jobs report showed the devastation being suffered by the hospitality industry due to restrictions on social gatherings that seem destined to last for weeks to come.
""January is shaping up to be another down month for employment,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist with Grant Thornton, via Twitter.
While U.S. authorities have been rolling out vaccines since their approval by the Food and Drug Administration, the overall level of protection among the population remains low. That argues against relaxing restrictions in the near term. Fatalities across the U.S. due to Covid-19 have topped 4,000 on both of the last two days, and the overall number of lives lost, at 385,000, is fast closing in on the 418,000 suffered during World War II.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has said that extending benefits for those made jobless by the pandemic will be a central part of a broad stimulus plan ""in the trillions of dollars"", which are due to be announced later Thursday.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy shrank by 5.0% in 2020, less than expected and a smaller contraction than during the global financial crisis, as unprecedented government rescue and stimulus measures helped lessen the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic.
With France and Italy, the euro zone's second and third biggest economies, each forecast to shrink by 9% in 2020, Thursday's preliminary data underlines how the crisis is increasing discrepancies within the 19-country currency bloc.
The contraction was smaller than a Reuters poll forecast of -5.1% and less severe than the record -5.7% suffered in 2009, during the financial crisis. Adjusted for calendar effects, gross domestic product declined by 5.3%, the statistics office said.
""It was actually a year of disaster, but judging by what had been feared in the course of the year, one could say we got off lightly,"" LBBW analyst Uwe Burkert said.
The statistics office said growth probably stagnated in the fourth quarter but carried positive momentum into 2021, suggesting Germany has so far managed to cope relatively well with a second wave of COVID-19 infections.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has since March unleashed an array of measures to help companies and consumers in Europe's biggest economy through the pandemic.
The debt-financed programmes include liquidity aid for struggling firms, job protection schemes for employees, tax cuts and cash handouts to boost domestic demand and long-term investments in green technologies and public infrastructure.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Berlin will do everything it can to ensure 2021 becomes the year of recovery but cautioned that overall growth could be somewhat smaller than previously projected.
The government estimated 2021 GDP growth of 4.4% in an October forecast due to be updated later this month. The Ifo economic institute expects 4.2% growth this year.
BORROW AND SPEND
The fiscal splurge was possible because parliament suspended constitutional limits on budget deficits, sending government borrowing to record highs.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is running as the Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for chancellor at elections in September, is expected to rack up a total of more than 300 billion euros in new debt in 2020 and 2021.
The public sector, including federal states, municipalities and social security systems, ran a budget deficit of 158.2 billion euros ($192.31 billion) or 4.8% of GDP, the office said.
That marked a severe deterioration of public finances following a surplus of 52.5 billion euros or 1.5% in 2019.
Private consumption tumbled 6% in 2020 on the year although disposable income edged up on average thanks to state aid and the Kurzarbeit short-time work scheme, the office said.
Lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus meant many consumers were not able to spend their money, so the net savings rate ballooned to a record high of 16.3%.
This pent-up spending power could boost household spending from the second quarter of 2021 if lockdown measures are gradually lifted in spring, the statistics office said.
Exports plunged nearly 10% while imports dropped 8.6%, suggesting that Germany's traditionally large trade surplus narrowed in the course of the pandemic.
The only bright spots came from government spending, which pushed up state consumption by 3.4%, and construction, where investment in building rose 1.5%, the preliminary data showed.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese exports grew more than expected in December, customs data showed on Thursday, as coronavirus disruptions around the world fuelled demand for Chinese goods even as a stronger yuan made shipments more expensive for overseas buyers.
A robust domestic recovery also spurred Chinese appetite for foreign products in December, with import growth quickening from the month prior and beating expectations in a Reuters poll.
While Chinese exports are likely to benefit from solid global demand at the start of this year, some analysts say a stronger yuan and rising raw materials costs could temper the momentum over coming months.
Exports rose 18.1% in December from a year earlier, slowing from a 21.1% jump in November but beating expectations for a 15% rise. Imports increased 6.5% year-on-year last month, topping a 5% forecast and picking up pace from November's 4.5% growth.
""China's exports grew in 2020, taking market share from other export-oriented economies. Although other export economies are likely to see a stronger 2021, the global recovery should still support China's export growth,"" said Iris Pang, ING's chief economist for China.
Customs spokesman Li Kuiwen concurred, telling a briefing that domestic demand will also support foreign trade, but cautioned that the pandemic would also bring some challenges in 2021.
Buoyant exports helped drive an impressive rebound in China's key manufacturing sector last year, with the world's second-biggest economy picking up the slack as the pandemic crunched production in many countries. China is expected to be the only major economy to have grown in 2020. Exports rose 3.6% over the full year and imports fell 1.1%.
Analysts say sustained demand for medical supplies and work-from-home products from coronavirus-hit trading partners should underpin the outlook for Chinese exports. 
But some worry a rise in raw material prices and in the yuan could squeeze exporters' profits. The onshore yuan jumped 6.7% in 2020 -- its first annual rise in three years.
""We think trade will remain resilient in the near-term but will soften later this year,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a research note.
U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS
China posted a trade surplus of $78.17 billion in December -- the highest reading on Refinitiv records going back to 2007. Analysts in the poll had expected the trade surplus to narrow to $72.35 billion from $75.40 billion in November. 
But its trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $29.92 billion in December from $37.42 billion in November, as Chinese imports grew faster than its exports to the United States.
The data points to ""Beijing’s continued effort to fulfill its commitments on the Phase One trade deal with the U.S.,"" said Nomura in a research note.
The world's two largest economies, which have imposed tit-for-tat tariffs in a bitter trade war, agreed on a Phase 1 trade agreement in January 2020, but significant tensions remain. 
While analysts think relations with China could be less fractious under the presidency of Joe Biden, due to take office on Jan. 20, Biden has said in a newspaper interview he will not immediately cancel the Phase 1 agreement nor take steps to remove tariffs on Chinese exports. 
""The main risk to China's trade outlook is on technology exports,"" ING's Pang said.
""It is unclear if the new U.S. government will put more pressure on China's technology exports, or if allies of the U.S. will join forces with them on this.""

Investing.com – Chinese exports exceeded growth expectations in December, according to customs data released earlier in the day, with continuous COVID-19 outbreaks fueling demand for Chinese goods although overseas buyers paid more for them thanks to a stronger yuan.
The data showed that all metrics outperformed. Exports grew 18.1% year-on-year against the 15% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com, but was lower than the 21.1% growth seen in November. Imports grew 6.5% year-on-year, beating the forecast 5% growth and November’s 4.5% growth.
The impressive rebound in China’s manufacturing sector in 2020 was largely driven by buoyant exports as the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic. The country is expected to be the only major economy to see positive growth in 2020, with exports growing 3.6% over the full year and imports falling 1.1%.
While COVID-19 will bring challenges, a reviving global economy and a steady recovery in China’s domestic economy provide a foundation for China to maintain trade growth in 2021, customs spokesman Liu Kuiwen said at a briefing.
Chinese exports are expected to see continuous support from the sustained demand for medical supplies and work-from-home products as trading partners continue to deal with COVID-19 outbreaks.
However, worries are mounting that the stronger yuan and rising raw material price could squeeze exporters’ profits. The yuan strengthened 6.7% in 2020 onshore trade, the first annual rise in three years.
“Exports continued to do well last month, as renewed lockdowns abroad ensured the shift in consumption from services to goods persisted in many of China’s trading partners,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note.
But Evans-Pritchard expects exports and imports to fall in late 2021 as the stimulus rolled out in 2020 runs out and overseas consumption returns to pre-COVID-19 patterns as vaccines boost a recovery.
“We think trade will remain resilient in the near-term but will soften later this year,” the note added.
Meanwhile, China’s trade balance was $78.17 billion in December, the highest reading on Refinitiv records going back to 2007. It was also higher than the forecast of $72.35 billion and November’s $75.40 billion figure.
The country’s trade surplus with the U.S., the country with which a bitter trade war has been waged in the last few years, narrowed to $29.92 billion in December from November’s $37.42 billion.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has indicated that he will not immediately cancel the phase one trade agreement that incumbent President Donald Trump struck with China in February 2020. Biden also said that he would not take steps to remove the current tariffs on Chinese exports."

962,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 09:25PM ET</span>","Japan machinery orders rise, COVID emergency clouds outlook","By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders unexpectedly rose for a second straight month in November, data showed on Thursday, although a renewed coronavirus emergency in Tokyo and 10 other areas may cool business appetite for capital spending. 
The surprise gain in core orders, a key indicator of capital expenditure, could be a temporary relief to policymakers hoping for corporate investment to spur a private demand-led recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
The Cabinet Office data showed core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 1.5% in November from October, led by increased demand for chip-making equipment and computers, possibly backed by people working from home.
It was a second straight month of gains and compared with economists' median estimate of a 6.2% drop, following a 17.1% jump in the previous month.
However, Japanese firms could grow cautious about boosting capital expenditure due to dwindling corporate profits, while a state of emergency implemented in Tokyo and 10 other prefectures through Feb. 7 could exacerbate conerns.
""Core orders likely picked up in the fourth quarter due to pent-up demand for capital spending thanks to government stimulus and overseas economic recovery,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""That will be temporary. The coronavirus has been spreading in Japan and elsewhere, forcing lockdowns in major economies, which will affect Japanese exports and service-sector activity.""
By sector, orders from manufacturers fell 2.4% month-on-month, while those from non-manufacturers grew 5.6% from the previous month, the Cabinet Office data showed.
The government raised its assessment on machinery orders, saying they showed a pick-up move. Previously it said orders had stopped falling.
Japan's economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter from its deepest postwar slump, thanks to pick-ups in exports and private consumption, which makes up more than half the economy.

But some analysts flagged the risk of a double-dip recession ahead given the current third wave of coronavirus infections.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased solidly in December amid a surge in the cost of gasoline, though underlying inflation remained tame as the economy battled a raging COVID-19 pandemic that has weighed on the labor market and services industry.
Inflation could, however, temporarily accelerate this year as the government provides more money to stimulate the economy, and the consumer price declines early in the coronavirus crisis wash out of the calculations. 
But that is unlikely to have an impact on the Federal Reserve, which has signaled it would tolerate higher prices after inflation persistently undershot the U.S. central bank's 2% target. The Fed has slashed interest rates to near zero and is pumping money into the economy through asset purchases.
Economists expect the ultra-easy monetary policy stance to last at least until 2024.
""We are likely to see a near-term spike in inflation on base effects of a reopening economy in 2021 versus a calamitous period in 2020, but that will fade through the second half of 2021,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Longer-term inflation is going to be primarily driven by wage costs given this is a service sector economy."" 
The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month after gaining 0.2% in November, the Labor Department said on Wednesday. An 8.4% jump in gasoline prices accounted for more than 60% of the increase in the CPI. Food prices also rebounded. The rise in the CPI was in line with economists' expectations. 
In the 12 months through December, the CPI advanced 1.4% after increasing 1.2% in November. The annual inflation rate is below the 1.7% average over the last 10 years.
(GRAPHIC: Inflation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkvlkggnpb/inflation.png) 
Higher prices could linger beyond the first half of 2021. A survey this month showed a measure of prices paid by manufacturers surged to a 2-1/2-year high in December because of bottlenecks in the supply chain. Rising price pressures at the factory gate were underscored by the Fed's Beige Book report on Wednesday showing ""growth in input prices continuing to outpace that of finished goods and services"" in early January. 
The report also showed businesses in several districts were able to pass on the higher production costs to consumers, especially in the retail, wholesale trade and manufacturing sectors, ""and some cited plans to increase selling prices in coming months.""
""Inventories are unusually lean for this early stage of the cycle and if the vaccination programs are a success ... the resulting surge in pent-up demand could keep inflation at, or above 2%, in the second half of the year, even after the spring base effects have faded,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. 
But with at least 19 million Americans on unemployment benefits, inflation is unlikely to become troublesome.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1% in December after climbing 0.2% in November. The so-called core CPI was restrained by decreases in the prices of used cars and trucks, recreation, airfares and healthcare. 
That blunted gains in the prices of new motor vehicles, apparel prices, household furnishings, personal care products and motor vehicle insurance.
The core CPI gained 1.6% on a year-on-year basis, matching November's rise, and is below the 2.0% average over the past 10 years. The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its inflation target, a flexible average. The core PCE price index is at 1.4%.
The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, has been hardest hit by the virus. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
RENTS MUTED
The government approved nearly $900 billion in additional pandemic relief in late December. More fiscal stimulus is expected from President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration and a Congress that will soon be controlled by Democrats. 
Biden, who will be sworn in next Wednesday, is expected to unveil a plan this week that will include relief for cash-strapped state and local governments, new support for people who lost their jobs or cannot afford rent, and $2,000 in direct cash payments to many Americans. 
Economists have upgraded their growth estimates for this year and U.S. Treasury yields have risen in anticipation of stronger economic growth in the second half of the year. 
Last month's rebound in gasoline prices followed two straight monthly decreases. Food prices rose 0.4%, with the cost of food consumed at home increasing 0.4%. Prices for food consumed away from home also rose 0.4%. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, edged up 0.1% after being unchanged in November. Many tenants have entered into forbearance agreements with landlords. Healthcare prices declined for a third straight month. 

""For the Fed, the biggest inflation concern over the next few years will remain inflation that is too low, not too high,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a December budget deficit of $144 billion - a record for the month - due to far higher outlays with coronavirus relief spending and unemployment benefits, while revenues ticked slightly higher, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's currency in circulation and bank deposits rose at a record pace in December, data showed on Wednesday, as a resurgence in coronavirus infections prompted companies and households to continue hoarding cash rather than spending it.
The numbers highlight the challenge the government faces in trying to contain the virus without threatening Japan's already fragile economic recovery.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to announce an extension of state of emergency measures beyond Tokyo as early as Wednesday as COVID-19 infections keep rising.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings fell moderately in November, but mounting layoffs amid rampant COVID-19 infections supported views that the labor market recovery from the pandemic was stalling.
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report from the Labor Department on Tuesday followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy shed workers in December for the first time in eight months. The slowing labor market and a worsening public health crisis could pressure the incoming Biden administration to deliver a bigger relief package.
Joe Biden will take over from President Donald Trump next Wednesday. The government approved nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus in late December after months of haggling, causing a delay that has also been blamed for the labor market's struggles.
""The labor market started softening even before the latest virus shutdowns,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 105,000 to 6.527 million on the last day of November. Though vacancies have decreased from as high as 7.012 million in January, they remain more than double levels seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
There were 1.6 unemployed workers for every vacancy in November. Job openings declined in manufacturing, information and educational service sectors. But there were more unfilled jobs in the retail sector. The job openings rate fell to 4.4% from 4.5% in October.
Layoffs increased 295,000 to nearly 2.0 million in November and were mostly in the West. That lifted the layoffs rate to 1.4% from 1.2% in October. Job cuts were led by the accommodation and food services industry, which shed 263,000 workers. Out-of-control coronavirus infections have led to wide-spread curbs on businesses, with restaurants and bars bearing the brunt of the restrictions.
There were 42,000 job losses in the healthcare and social assistance sector. State and local governments, which are experiencing tight budgets because of the pandemic, laid off 21,000 workers.
""Stripping out the wild monthly swings of the coronavirus recession, the rise in layoff activity is historically large and surpasses the increases seen at the height of the Great Recession,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the JOLTS data.
SLOW RECOVERY
A separate report showed a sharp decline in confidence among small businesses in December. Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the plunge in sentiment reported by the National Federation of Independent Business, which they said largely reflected Republican Trump's electoral loss to Democrat Biden.
""Respondents to the NFIB survey tend to favor Republicans,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The NFIB survey overestimates growth under Republicans and underestimates it for Democrats.""
In November, hiring rose 67,000 to 5.979 million. Hiring increased in the professional and business services, and mining and logging industries. It fell in accommodation and food services, other services and information sectors. The hiring rate was steady at 4.2%.
The economy shed 140,000 jobs in December, the first decline in nonfarm payrolls since April, after adding 336,000 positions in November. The economy has recovered 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.
The JOLTS report showed the number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs was steady at 3.156 million, though 64,000 workers quit in the accommodation and food services industries. Many people in the prime-age group, mostly women, have quit jobs to look after children or because they are fearful of contracting COVID-19.
The quits rate was unchanged at 2.2% in November.

""With hiring and job openings at these levels, the economy is facing a long, slow recovery without additional action from Congress,"" said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.

“With economic activity set to remain strong and underlying inflation likely to continue rising, we think the PBOC will tighten policy this year,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard told Reuters.
The NBS data also showed that December’s consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.7% month-on-month and 0.2% year-on-year in December. The pair also beat expectations, with the index forecasted to rise 0.4% month-on-month and 0.1% year-on-year. The CPI returned to growth in December, after seeing declines of 0.6% month-on-month and 0.5% year-on-year during the previous month, as food prices rebounded.
Food prices rose as extreme cold weather drove the transportation costs of fresh vegetables and fruit higher while holiday demand drove up meat product prices, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan told Reuters.
Prices saw a 1.2% increase from a year ago, compared with a decline of 2.0% in November. However, some investors expect a drop in pork prices due to the replenishment of hog stocks, to weigh on consumer prices over the next couple of months.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2021 11:26PM ET</span>",China's factory prices fall at slowest pace in 10 months in December,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate prices fell last month at their slowest pace since February, official data showed on Monday, suggesting the country's manufacturing sector continues to see a rapid recovery from the COVID-19 shock.
The producer price index (PPI) eased 0.4% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement. The index was expected to decline by 0.8%, according to a median forecast in a Reuters poll, after a 1.5% drop in November. Monthly PPI rose at its fastest pace in four years.
Annual consumer prices meanwhile returned to growth last month, underpinned by a rebound in food prices, after falling in November for the first time in over a decade.
An impressive rebound in China's industrial sector has helped the world's second-largest economy post a robust recovery from the COVID-19 shock in early 2020. 
The pace of recovery has led analysts to believe the People's Bank of China (PBOC) could begin to unwind loose monetary policy, but governor Yi Gang said on Friday China will prioritise stability in monetary policy this year.
""With economic activity set to remain strong and underlying inflation likely to continue rising, we think the PBOC will tighten policy this year,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist, at Capital Economics.
The data comes as Chinese manufacturing activity expanded in December but at a slightly slower pace amid higher raw material costs.
Prices for raw materials fell 1.6% from a year ago, compared with a decline of 4.2% in the previous month, the data showed. PPI rose 1.1% last month, the fastest pace since December 2016.
""Judging from the current significant rebound in global commodity prices, (annual) PPI could soon enter positive growth territory,"" said Zhang Yongjun, analyst at China Centre for International Economic Exchanges. 
MUTED CONSUMER INFLATION
Consumer prices rose in December due to higher food prices.
The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.2% from a year earlier, against expectations in a Reuters poll for a 0.1% rise, and bringing full-year consumer price inflation to 2.5% in 2020. 
The index had eased 0.5% in November, the first fall since 2009.
Food prices rose as extreme cold weather drove the transportation costs of fresh vegetables and fruit higher while seasonal holiday demand drove up the prices of meat products, said Dong Lijuan, senior statistician with the NBS. 
Food prices rose 1.2% from a year ago, compared with a decline of 2.0% in the previous month. 

But some analysts say a slide in pork prices, driven by the replenishment of hog stocks, may weigh on consumer prices over the next couple of months.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada lost more jobs than expected in December, Statistics Canada data showed on Friday, with economists and industry groups warning protracted COVID-19 restrictions across much of the country are darkening the outlook into the first quarter.
Canada lost 62,600 jobs in December, more than double analysts' expectations of a decline of 27,500, while the unemployment rate edged up to 8.6%, in line with expectations. Employment remains 3.3% below pre-pandemic levels.
Canada's new COVID-19 cases, meanwhile, now average 7,688 per day, forcing a number of regions across the country to impose harsher restrictions that experts say will further hit employment. 
""As cases continue to reach record highs, the prospect of protracted lockdowns loom large over the first quarter,"" said Leah Nord, senior director of workforce strategies at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, in a statement.
""We believe that many of the rebound gains of the last seven months are at risk of being lost, signaling a potential return to darker times for Canada's labor market over the coming months,"" she added.
Populous Quebec imposed a curfew earlier this week and extended existing lockdowns through to February, while Ontario on Thursday said it would keep most schools closed for an additional two weeks amid a partial lockdown. 
The poor outlook for employment could put pressure on the Bank of Canada to further ease monetary policy, economists said. The central bank has said it could cut record low interest rates further if the economic situation worsens. 
The Canadian dollar gave back some of the week's gain, dipping 0.2% to 1.2713 per U.S. dollar, or 78.66 U.S. cents, while Canada's S&P/TSX composite index fell 14.84 points, or 0.08%, after notching a record high Thursday as investors bet on a global economic rebound.
The service sector, hit by fresh restrictions on retail, food services, fitness and travel, lost 74,000 jobs, while employment in the goods sector rose by 11,300.
""It's almost textbook, the decline was almost entirely in accommodation and food services, which lost almost 57,000 jobs,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Porter added the overall decline was only a fraction of that in March and April, when broad national shutdowns led to more than 3 million job losses.

Part-time employment fell by 99,000 positions, while full-time employment fared better, up by 36,500 jobs, Statscan said. Youth employment slipped in December, with employment of 15-24 year olds remaining 10.5% below pre-pandemic levels.

The Commerce Department estimated last month that wholesale inventories dipped 0.1% in November. Stocks at wholesalers surged 1.3% in October. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product fell 0.1% in November.
Inventories decreased 2.1% in November from a year earlier.
The economy is expected to have expanded at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, with the bulk of the rise in gross domestic product seen coming from inventory investment.
Businesses are replenishing inventories after they were drawn down early in the pandemic. That has helped to underpin manufacturing. Inventory accumulation is expected to blunt some of the drag on GDP from a widening trade deficit, which hit a more than 14-year high in November.
The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Inventories added to GDP growth in the third quarter after being a drag for five straight quarters.
Wholesale stocks of motor vehicles and parts rebounded 0.8% in November after slipping 0.2% in October.
Sales at wholesalers rose 0.2% in November after accelerating 1.7% in October. At November's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.31 months to clear shelves, unchanged from October.

Investing.com --- The U.S. labor market suffered its first net loss of jobs in eight months in December, as the surge in Covid-19 cases hit service sectors of the economy hard in the runup to the Christmas holiday. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm employment fell by 140,000 through the middle of the month, compared with expectations for an increase of 71,000. However, the waters were muddied by a big upward revision to hiring in November, where payrolls grew by 336,000, rather than the 245,000 initially reported last month. 
The unemployment rate, meanwhile, stayed at 6.7% of the workforce, defying expectations of an increase to 6.8%.
The carnage of lockdown measures was most evident in the hospitality sector, where 372,000 jobs were lost in bars and restaurants nationwide. Another 92,000 were lost in entertainment parks and casinos.  That was partly offset by a boom in delivery services as the pandemic forced Christmas shoppers online. Around 37,000 jobs were created for messengers and couriers, while another 59,000 were created in warehouses and other wholesale centers.
The markets reacted by seeing the data as 'bad news but old news'. After an initial dip, Dow Jones Futures were back trading at their pre-release level within 20 minutes.  The yield on the 10-Year Treasury bond, which had broken out of a long-standing range to the upside this week on expectations of a big increase in government borrowing, was also little changed, rising two basis points to 1.09%.
The monthly labor report is no longer the key driver that it once was for markets that are focusing overwhelmingly on the spending plans of the new administration and the perceived willingness of the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels."

The quarterly poll of chief financial officers from accountants Deloitte showed the biggest improvement in optimism since the survey started in 2007.
Still, half of the respondents said it would take at least until the end of 2021 before revenues return to their pre-pandemic levels - chiming with a Bank of England survey published this week.
""Boosted by the prospect of mass vaccination and growth, business sentiment surged this quarter with CFOs taking the most positive view on profit margins for the last five years,"" said Ian Stewart, Deloitte's chief economist.
Expectations for hiring and investment recovered in the latest survey but still remained in negative territory.
On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said a surge in investment was critical this year to help heal the scars left by the pandemic.
Many economists believe Britain has slipped back into recession, with the BoE estimating the economy shrank by just over 1% in the fourth quarter and others predicting further contraction in early 2021.
Britain has recorded Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19 at more than 78,000 and also saw its economy shrink by a fifth during the second quarter of 2020, the sharpest decline among the world's seven largest advanced economies.

The Deloitte survey of 90 CFOs was conducted between Dec. 2 and Dec. 14, including respondents from 12 FTSE 100-listed companies and 44 from FTSE 250 firms.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly dipped last week while staying extremely high, with the labor market recovery appearing to stall as a raging COVID-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm the country.
Layoffs announced by U.S. companies surged 18.9% in December, other data on Thursday showed. Though services industry activity accelerated last month, employment fell. The reports followed on the heels of news on Wednesday that private companies shed workers in December, heightening the risk that the economy lost jobs last month for the first time since April. 
Still, the economy is unlikely to slide back into recession after the government approved additional pandemic relief in late December, with more fiscal stimulus likely. Democrats on Wednesday won two Senate seats in runoff elections in Georgia, giving the party control of the chamber and boosting the prospects for President-elect Joe Biden's legislative agenda. Congress on Thursday formally certified Biden's election victory hours after hundreds of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol.
""The labor market will struggle this winter because of surging COVID-19 cases,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The good news is additional support is likely coming in the first quarter.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 for the week ended Jan. 2, compared to 790,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 800,000 applications in the latest week.
Claims were likely held down by difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations around this time of the year. Unadjusted claims jumped 77,400 to 922,072 last week. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.08 million people filed claims last week. 
(GRAPHIC: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwknrjpw/joblessclaims.png) 
Elevated claims are in line with other data that have suggested the economy was taking a beating from business restrictions and retrenchment in consumer spending because of the pandemic. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Dec. 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers expected soaring coronavirus cases ""would be particularly challenging for the labor market in coming months."" 
COVID-19 cases in the United States have jumped to more than 21 million, with the death toll exceeding 356,000 since the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
In a second report on Thursday, global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said U.S. companies announced 77,030 job cuts in December, up from 64,797 in November. That brought total layoffs in 2020 to a record 2.305 million, a 289% surge compared to 2019. Nearly half of the job cuts were due to the pandemic.

Separately, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of services industry employment dropped to a reading of 48.2 last month from 51.5 in November. The ISM said comments from companies included ""less staff needed in restaurants due to restrictions"" and ""we had to reduce our workforce even further.""
U.S. stocks were trading higher as investors bet on more pandemic aid under a Democrat-controlled Congress. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
MILLIONS ON BENEFITS
The government is scheduled to publish its closely followed employment report for December on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 71,000 jobs after rising by 245,000 in November. 
That would be the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and mean the economy recouped about 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.
Jobless claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March. The government in late December approved nearly $900 billion in additional fiscal stimulus, including the renewal of a $300 unemployment supplement until March 14.
Government-funded programs for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the state unemployment programs as well as those who have exhausted their benefits were also extended in the package. 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 126,000 to 5.072 million in the week ending Dec. 26. But many have exhausted their eligibility, limited to six months in most states. About 4.517 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Dec. 19. Roughly 19.177 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in mid-December. 
The economy plunged into recession in February. Though it is expected to have expanded at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the bulk of the rise in gross domestic product will likely come from the rebuilding of inventories.
A fourth report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit widened 8.0% to $68.1 billion in November, the highest since August 2006. The deficit was boosted by a jump in imports.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 10:05AM ET</span>",U.S. service sector regains speed in December - ISM survey,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity accelerated in December, but sky-rocketing COVID-19 infections depressed employment, heightening the risk that the economy shed jobs for the first time since the labor market recovery from the pandemic started.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index increased to a reading of 57.2 last month from 55.9 in November.
That lifted the index to within striking distance of its 57.3 level in February, before the coronavirus pandemic reached the United States. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to 54.6 in December.
The surprise pick-up in services sector activity mirrors a similar rise in production at factories last month despite the country being engulfed by a fresh wave of coronavirus cases.
As with the manufacturing data, the improvement in the services industry index partly reflected a rise in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 62.8 last month from 57.0 in November. A lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution.
But in this instance that indicates supply shortages due to the pandemic.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry rebounded to a reading of 58.5 in December from 57.2 in November. That came as a measure of export orders jumped to 57.3 from a reading of 50.4 in November. But the global resurgence in the virus suggests the robust export growth is unsustainable.
Backlog orders contracted, indicating a slowdown in the services industry activity in the near term.
The survey's index of services industry employment fell to a reading of 48.2 last month from 51.5 in November. That increases the possibility that the economy lost jobs in December for the first time since April. A report on Wednesday showed a decline in employment at private companies last month.
But a survey from the ISM on Tuesday showed employment at factories rebounded in December.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 71,000 jobs after rising by 245,000 in November. That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and mean the economy recouped about 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade gap widened 8.0% to $68.1 billion in November, the highest level since August 2006. The deficit in October was unrevised at $63.1 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall increasing to $65.2 billion in November.
Imports jumped 2.9% to $252.3 billion. Goods imports accelerated 3.0% to $214.1 billion, the highest since May 2019. Exports rose 1.2% to $184.2 billion. Goods exports advanced 1.0% to $127.7 billion.
Rising imports and the resulting widening in the trade deficit are a drag on gross domestic product. But much of the imports likely ended up in warehouses, boosting inventories. The accumulation of inventories is likely to counter the hit to GDP from imports.
The economy is expected to have expanded at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, with the bulk of the rise in gross domestic product seen coming from inventory investment. The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

Investing.com -- The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits stayed roughly unchanged at the historically high level of 787,000 last week, according to figures released on Thursday by the Labor Department.
That's fractionally below the 800,000 expected by analysts ahead of time and down by 3,000 from the previous week's figure, which was revised up a shade.
The number of continuing claims fell by more than expected to 5.072 million from 5.198 million, the latter figure being revised down by 21,000 from its initial estimate. 
The numbers appear to indicate no meaningful improvement in the labor market since the cut-off date for December's nationwide payrolls surveys. ADP's monthly survey for December, which covered the period up to the middle of last month, showed that private payrolls fell by 123,000 in a month when the service sector in particular was hit by a fresh surge in Covid-19 cases nationwide.
""The underlying story here is clear,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""A combination of Covid fear and state-mandated restrictions on activity in the services sector is squeezing businesses, and no real relief is likely until a sustained decline in pressure on hospitals emerges; that’s probably a story for late February at the earliest.""
He noted that while the figures reflect real hardship, there was comfort in the fact that they had not developed more serious upward momentum.
The impact of the numbers on financial markets was minimal Thursday, overshadowed by the prospect of more aggressive stimulus from the incoming administration of Joe Biden, which will be able to count on majorities in both houses of Congress. By 9 AM, Dow Jones Futures were up 128 points, or 0.4%, while NASDAQ Futures were up 0.9%.
 Yields on 10-YearTreasury bonds, however, resumed their rise, hitting 1.07% after crashing through 1% for the first time in 10 months on the back of Georgia's Senate seat runoffs on Wednesday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Economic sentiment in the euro zone ticked up last month but inflation held in negative territory before what is likely to be a slow rise this year as some tax cuts are reversed, oil prices rise and the economy starts to recover.
Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was unchanged at minus 0.3% in December, Eurostat data showed on Thursday, underperforming analyst expectations for a minus 0.2% reading but broadly in line with the European Central Bank's own projections. 
With the economy likely shrinking again in the fourth quarter and inflation below zero since August, the ECB already approved a new package of stimulus measures in December, extending copious asset buys well into 2022 to insulate an economy likely to face permanent damage from the pandemic.
Its measures are expected to keep borrowing costs record low for years to come, providing crucial support just as the bloc faces even stricter lockdown measures with governments shutting down much of the services sector over fears that a fresh wave of coronavirus infections could overwhelm heath care system. 
Still, economic sentiment edged up to 90.4 points in December from 87.7 in November, against expectations of a rise to 90.0 points, a European Commission monthly survey showed.
The better reading was mainly thanks to an improvement in industry to -7.2 from -10.1 and among consumers to -13.9 from -17.6 points. 
Thursday's inflation reading could be the last negative figure in the current cycle as a temporary German value added tax cut expired at the end of 2020 and crude oil prices are up around 45% since the start of November. 
The ECB expects inflation to rise to 0.3% in the first quarter, then to 1.5% by the fourth quarter as activity restarts and weak year earlier figures get knocked out from base figures.
Still, inflation, which has undershot the ECB's nearly 2% target since 2013, is likely to dip again next year and will not approach the bank's objective for years to come as the recover from the pandemic will be protracted. 
Separately, Eurostat said euro zone retail sales plunged much more than expected in November as countries across Europe began to re-introduce pandemic restrictions. The sales falls were deepest in Belgium and France which imposed the toughest measures early.

Euro zone retail sales dropped 6.1% month-on-month for a 2.9% year-on-year fall. In Belgium the monthly drop was 15.9% and in France 18.0%. Economists polled by Reuters had expected euro zone retail sales to fall 3.4% on the month and rise 0.8% on the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - British companies saw a slightly worsening hit to sales and jobs from the COVID-19 pandemic last month when the virus spread increasingly through the population, a Bank of England survey showed on Thursday.
Companies said the pandemic cut 16.1% on average from sales during the fourth quarter, the BoE said, more than the 15.3% hit pencilled in from November's survey. They also saw a bigger hit to jobs.
The worsening conditions came last month despite positive news on COVID-19 vaccines and a relaxation of health restrictions in many parts of England.
On Wednesday the United Kingdom recorded more than 1,000 COVID-19 daily deaths for the first time since April as the government struggles to deal with a new, more infectious variant of the coronavirus.
Like previous editions, the latest BoE survey showed hospitality businesses have been hit especially hard by the pandemic.
Food and accommodation businesses thought the hit to jobs and sales from the pandemic would persist into at least 2022.

The BoE survey was conducted between Dec. 4 and Dec. 18 and was based on responses from 2,933 firms.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction sector extended its robust recovery from earlier COVID lockdown restrictions in December, a survey showed on Thursday, helping the broader private-sector economy eke out modest growth.
Housing was the biggest driver of construction growth, reflecting the boost to builders' confidence from a surge in prices and property purchases since the middle of the year, when lockdown curbs eased and property purchase taxes were cut.
The IHS Markit/CIPS construction Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 54.6 in December from 54.7 in November, but remained comfortably above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction, as it has been since June.
""A sustained improvement in construction order books resulted in a rise in employment numbers for the first time in nearly two years and the most optimistic growth expectations since April 2017,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
Britain's wider economy has been doing less well since COVID cases started to rise from late September onwards, leading to a four-week lockdown in England in November and open-ended curbs introduced this week due to a new more infectious variant.
The all-sector PMI, which is dominated by the services industry, barely returned to growth in December, rising to 50.8 from November's five-month low of 49.5.
Services PMI data on Wednesday painted a picture of firms continuing to struggle as restaurants, pubs and many other consumer-facing businesses remained shut or under heavy restrictions.
Many economists believe Britain has slipped back into recession, with the Bank of England estimating the economy shrank by just over 1% in the fourth quarter and others predicting further contraction in early 2021.

Britain has recorded Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19 at more than 76,000 and also saw its economy shrink by a fifth during the second quarter of 2020, the sharpest decline among the world's seven largest advanced economies.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private companies shed workers in December for the first time in eight months as out-of-control COVID-19 infections unleashed a fresh wave of business restrictions, setting the tone for what is likely to be a brutal winter for the economy.
The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed job losses across all industries last month as the coronavirus outbreak kept many consumers and workers at home. While the report underscored the magnitude of the crisis, the economy was unlikely to slide back into recession, thanks to additional fiscal stimulus approved in late December.
The ADP report added to slumping consumer spending and persistently high layoffs in suggesting that the economy lost significant momentum at the end of 2020. Minutes of the Federal Reserve's Dec. 15-16 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers expected skyrocketing cases ""would be particularly challenging for the labor market in coming months.""
""America's great jobs machine ran into a wall of rising coronavirus cases and state lockdowns which puts the entire economic recovery from recession at risk,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The heart of every recession is job losses and right now the decline in jobs at year end is hinting that the dark days of the labor market last spring have returned.""
Private payrolls decreased by 123,000 jobs last month, the first decline since April, after increasing 304,000 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would rise by 88,000 in December.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Though it has a spotty record predicting the government's private payrolls count because of methodology differences, it is still watched for clues on the labor market's health.

COVID-19 cases in the United States have jumped to more than 20 million, with the death toll exceeding 352,000 since the virus first emerged in China in late 2019, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In addition to the virus, the labor market has been constrained by government delays in providing another relief package for businesses and the unemployed. 
More than $3 trillion in fiscal stimulus helped companies to rehire workers and keep others on payrolls. It also assisted millions of unemployed and underemployed Americans to pay bills and maintain spending, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. Nearly $900 billion in additional government rescue money was approved in late December.
""While the economy is on the verge of double-dipping, I don't think it will,"" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told reporters. ""The additional $900 billion will help in ensuring that the economy does not backslide into recession.""

BROAD WEAKNESS
Manufacturing shed 21,000 jobs in December, while payrolls in the private services industry dropped by 105,000. There were 13,000 job losses among small companies. Large companies payrolls decreased by 147,000. Medium-sized companied hired 37,000 workers last month.
The ADP report was released ahead of the government's closely watched, and comprehensive, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, private nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 98,000 jobs in December after rising by 344,000 in November.
With government payrolls expected to have dropped again last month, overall nonfarm payrolls are forecast increasing by 71,000 jobs after rising by 245,000 in November. That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and mean the economy recouped about 12.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.
Economists are predicting it could take a while for all the lost jobs to be recovered, even with additional fiscal support and herd immunity to the virus from vaccines that are being rolled out. The decline in ADP private payrolls supports several economists' expectations that the economy shed jobs in December, though those dire predictions have been countered by a survey on Tuesday showing employment at factories rebounding in December.
Other economists said this argued for job growth last month, though at a significantly slower pace than in November.

Economic growth estimates for the fourth quarter are around a 5.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a historic 33.4% pace in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that factory orders rose 1.0% after increasing 1.3% in October.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 0.7% in November. Orders fell 7.3% year-on-year.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Institute for Supply Management reported on Tuesday that its index of national factory activity increased in December to the highest level since August 2018.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, advanced 0.5% in November instead of 0.4% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 0.5%. They were previously reported to have increased 0.4%.
Business spending on equipment rebounded in the third quarter, ending five straight quarters of decline. The economy grew at a 33.4% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy made only a subdued return to growth in December after shrinking during a four-week England-wide coronavirus lockdown in November, as the large services sector failed to fully recover, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.4 in December from 49.0 in November, a slightly smaller increase than in an earlier flash estimate.
The services PMI, which makes up the largest part of the composite index, remained below the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction at 49.4. This was up from November's five-month low of 47.6 but also below the flash reading.
""December data confirm that the UK service sector has swung back into decline after the partial rebound seen during the third quarter of 2020, largely reflecting tighter restrictions on consumer services amid the worsening trajectory of the pandemic,"" IHS Markit economics director Tim Moore said.
December had brought some optimism to British businesses with the beginning of the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
Businesses are more optimistic about the outlook, with the index for future output only a fraction lower than November's five-year high.
But vaccinations started too late to stop a surge in cases which on Monday prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to set out a new, tougher lockdown. This will last until at least mid-February and economists think it will tip Britain back into recession.
""Service providers will be braced for a sustained period of subdued UK economic conditions and deferred client spending in the first quarter of this year,"" Moore said.
The economic damage is not expected to be on the scale of the first lockdown, when economic output slumped as much as 25%.
But a survey from the British Chambers of Commerce, released late on Tuesday, showed many businesses not directly affected by lockdown restrictions reported a drop in sales during November's lockdown as their clients suffered cashflow difficulties.

With infection rates soaring across Europe, countries have clamped down on public life. Germany is set to extend its strict lockdown until the end of the month and Italy decided on Tuesday to keep some nationwide restrictions in place.
IHS Markit's final December Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), seen as a good gauge of economic health, did rise to 49.1 from November's 45.3 but was significantly below a flash reading of 49.8. Anything below 50 indicates contraction.
""Service sector activity in particular fell more sharply than estimated by the earlier flash PMI estimate, as more countries stepped up their fights against rising virus case numbers,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
The services PMI registered 46.4 in December, better than the previous month's 41.7 but far weaker than the 47.3 preliminary estimate.
With much of the service industry being forced to close demand also shrank a lot more than thought. The final services new business index was 46.6 compared to the flash estimate of 47.9, albeit better than November's 40.6.
""Worse may be yet to come before things get better, especially as the latest survey data were collected before the news of the new – more contagious – strain of the virus,"" Williamson said.
""Service sector activity in particular looks likely to remain constrained by severe social distancing in the early months of the new year.""
But with vaccines being rolled out across the continent overall optimism about the year ahead improved. The composite future output index rose to 64.5 from 60.4, its highest reading since April 2018.
The bloc's economy is expected to gain momentum this year on vaccine hopes, a Reuters poll found last month, and will return to pre-crisis levels within two years. [ECILT/EU]

Investing.com – China’s services sector activity expanded at a slower pace in December, according to a private sector survey, as sporadic COVID-19 outbreaks in the country tempered the recovery in consumer confidence and impacted new business growth.
The Caixin services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for December, released earlier in the day, read 56.3, a three-month low. The reading was lower than November’s 57.8 figure, but remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion.
The data follows Monday’s Caixin Manufacturing PMI, which read 53 for December. The National Bureau of Statistics also released the manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI during the previous week, which read 51.9 and 55.7 respectively.
Growth in new export business, which had only returned to expansion in November, eased as the surging number of COVID-19 cases globally dampened overseas demand. The survey also showed that a further sharp rise in input price led companies to increase their prices charged at the fastest pace since January 2008.
The services sector has been slower to recover than the industrial sector as it is more vulnerable to the impact of tightened social distancing measures. Measures have been tightened in northern China, including Beijing, Hebei and Liaoning provinces, as clusters of COVID-19 cases emerge in those areas. Chinese tourists shunned overseas travel in 2020 thanks to COVID-19, and are limiting travel to nearby cities as well as avoiding trips out of their provinces.
However, the survey showed that business expectations over the next 12 months were at their highest levels since April 2011, as vaccine rollouts globally increase hopes that the pandemic will come to an end.
“Looking ahead, we expect the post-epidemic economic recovery to continue for several months, and macroeconomic indicators will be stronger over the next six months due to the low bases in the first half of 2020,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said.
“Meanwhile, we need to pay attention to the mounting pressure on costs brought by the increase in raw material prices and its adverse impact on employment, which is particularly important to figuring out how to exit the stimulus policies implemented during the epidemic,” Wang added."
990,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2021 01:35PM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity approaches 2-1/2-year high; COVID-19 hitting supply chains,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. factory activity accelerated to its highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years in December as the coronavirus pandemic continues to pull demand away from services towards goods, though spiraling new infections are causing bottlenecks in supply chains.
The strength in manufacturing reported by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday likely helped to soften the blow on the economy in the fourth quarter from the relentless spread of COVID-19 and government delays in approving another rescue package to help businesses and the unemployed.
The ISM said the virus was ""limiting manufacturing growth potential"" because of absenteeism and short-term shutdowns to sanitize facilities at factories and their suppliers.
""U.S. manufacturing should fare reasonably well this winter as businesses need to restock inventories and the shift in consumer spending away from services to goods helps manufacturers,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
The ISM's index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 60.7 last month. That was the highest level since August 2018 and followed a reading of 57.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.9% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would slip to 56.6 in December. 
The ISM survey mirrored manufacturing gains in the euro zone and China. 
Some of the surprise rebound in the ISM index, however, was due to an increase in the survey's measure of supplier deliveries to a reading of 67.6 last month from 61.7 in November. A lengthening in suppliers' delivery times is normally associated with a strong economy and increased customer demand, which would be a positive contribution. 
But in this case slower supplier deliveries indicate supply shortages related to the pandemic.
Nevertheless, demand for manufactured goods has been strong as the resurgence in new COVID-19 cases has led to fresh business restrictions across the United States, largely impacting the vast services sector. 
A large section of the population continues to work and take classes at home, fueling a scramble for electronics, home improvement products and other goods like exercise equipment.
Sixteen out of 18 manufacturing industries reported growth in December. Computer and electronic products manufacturers said they continued to have ""tailwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic research support for vaccines and treatments.""
Makers of miscellaneous products reported that sales had exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels. Electrical equipment, appliances and components producers said business was stronger than expected, ""with higher demand for many products."" 
Despite strong demand, manufacturing output is still about 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level, according to the Federal Reserve. That could persist for a while as the new wave of infections causes disruptions to labor and the supply chain.
Food manufacturers complained the virus was ""affecting us more strongly now than back in March."" Similar sentiments were echoed by transportation equipment makers who said the outbreaks were constraining suppliers. Plastics and rubber products also reported that their suppliers were having difficulty finding and retaining labor.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors focused on two runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday that will determine whether Republicans maintain control of the U.S. Senate. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
STRONG ORDERS GROWTH 
The ISM report followed on the heels of data on Monday showing strong construction spending in November and October. Strength in these sectors supports economists' predictions that the economy grew at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter after a record 33.4% pace in the third quarter.
The manufacturing boost to gross domestic product would come through an accumulation of inventory by businesses.
The virus and depleted government pandemic money took a bite out of consumer spending in November. More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief fueled growth in the July-September quarter after the economy contracted at a historic 31.4% rate in the second quarter. Nearly $900 billion in fiscal stimulus was approved in late December.
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index rose to a reading of 67.9 last month from 65.1 in November. A measure of backlog orders hit a 2-1/2-year high.
Strong orders growth boosted manufacturing employment, which had contracted in November. The ISM's manufacturing employment gauge rebounded to 51.5 from a reading of 48.4 in November. 
That could temper some economists' expectations that the economy shed jobs in December. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 100,000 jobs last month after rising by 245,000 in November.
But the supply chain gridlock is driving up costs for manufacturers. The survey's prices paid index jumped to a reading of 77.6 last month, the highest since May 2018, from 65.4 in November. That raises the risk of higher inflation.

""If the cost pressures are sustained and passed on to consumers, it could lead to higher consumer inflation down the road,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

The labor market has lost steam in tandem with the economy since job growth peaked at a record 4.781 million in June.

According to an early Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 100,000 jobs last month after rising by 245,000 in November.

Retail sales rose 1.9% in November, when markets had anticipated a contraction, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday, adding that it expected sales to have grown around 4% during 2020 as a whole - exceeding 2019's 3.2% expansion.
The monthly increase - covering a period when Germany was in partial lockdown with shops still open - was driven by online transactions and spending on home improvements, the office said on Tuesday.
In separate data, the Federal Labour Agency said the number of jobless fell a seasonally-adjusted 37,000 year on year in December, when the lockdown was tightened, with most shops forced to close from mid-month. Analysts had expected an increase.
""The apparent resilience of the German economy in late 2020 bodes well for the new year,"" said Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding. ""Despite a likely setback early this year, we look for a strong rebound starting no later than April.""
The employment numbers - which ING analyst Carsten Brzeski cautioned should be taken with ""a big spoon of salt"" - were boosted by a state-backed part-time work scheme designed to protect jobs that some 666,000 people were placed on in December.
Germany is expected to further extend its tougher anti-COVID restrictions on Tuesday as infection rates have remained high.
The Statistics Office said its provisional full-year retail sales growth figure - contrasting with an expected drop of 5.5% in gross domestic product, according to the Bundesbank - included December's full lockdown.
The office also said the estimate was ""freighted with greater uncertainties"" than usual due to the pandemic. 
November's biggest winners were in online and delivery retail, where revenues rose 31.8% year on year, while spending on household decorations, appliances and building materials rose 15.4%.

Mixed retail, including department stores, fell 6.1%.

993,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 11:30AM ET</span>",U.S. construction spending races to record high in November,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending rose to a record high in November, boosted by a robust housing market amid historically low mortgage rates, which could help blunt some of the hit on the economy from raging COVID-19 infections.
The Commerce Department said on Monday that construction spending increased 0.9% to $1.459 trillion, the highest level since the government started tracking the series in 2002. Data for October was revised higher to show construction outlays accelerating 1.6% instead of 1.3% as previously reported.
Strong construction spending supports economists' predictions that the economy grew at around a 5% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The sharp step-down from a record 33.4% pace in the third quarter reflects a resurgence in coronavirus cases, which has slammed the services sector. 
Growth is also slowing following the exhaustion of more than $3 trillion dollars in government pandemic relief and delays in approving another rescue package. Nearly $900 billion in fiscal stimulus was approved in late December. 
Construction spending accounts for about 5% of gross domestic product. 
""The data imply modest upside risk for our GDP growth forecast of a 4.3% rate in the fourth quarter,"" said Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado. ""The housing boom is lifting construction activity overall ... despite some stalling in the transactions-related housing data in recent months.""
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 1.0% in November. Construction spending increased 3.8% on a year-on-year basis in November.
Spending on private construction projects increased 1.2%, fueled by investment in single-family homebuilding amid record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low-density areas. That followed a 1.6% advance in October.
Spending on residential projects increased 2.7% after surging 3.2% in October. 
But outlays on nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.8% in November. The pandemic has depressed prices, leading to a contraction in spending on nonresidential structures in the third quarter. The fourth straight quarterly drop in investment in nonresidential structures bucked a rebound in overall business investment.
Spending on public construction projects eased 0.2% in November after rising 1.6% in October. State and local government outlays edged up 0.1%, while federal government spending dropped 4.2%.

""Nonresidential and public construction remain subdued owing to weak demand related to disruptions from virus containment as well as budget constraints,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

Still, IHS Markit's final manufacturing purchasing managers' survey of a rocky 2020, released on Monday, showed the sector's rebound was uneven. Consumer goods makers saw weaker order flow as COVID-19 infections surged and limited consumer spending, while producers of machinery and equipment noted strong demand in a potential sign of improving business investment, said Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit.
IHS Markit said its manufacturing PMI climbed to 57.1 in December from 56.7 in November. The index also improved from its preliminary - or ""flash"" - reading in mid-December of 56.5, with a reading above 50 signaling expansion in activity.
The index finished 2020 at its highest level since September 2014, with December's gain marking the eighth straight month of improvement after plunging to its lowest in more than a decade in April when the first rounds of business shutdowns to contain COVID-19 were in full swing.
With output moderating to 58.3 last month from 59.2 in November, the headline index's improvement was driven largely by a strong pricing environment, IHS Markit said. Its output price index rose to its highest since May 2011.

""Amid a significant deterioration in vendor performance, cost burdens and selling prices soared, as firms sought to partially pass on higher input prices,"" IHS Markit said in a statement. ""Output expectations moderated slightly, however, as the post-election spike eased and virus cases surged once again.""

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 57.9 in December from 55.8 in November, the sixth straight month that the PMI was above the 50 threshold that marks expansion in the sector.
It was the highest level for the index since the survey began in October 2010.
The data ""indicated the Canadian manufacturing sector concluded 2020 with a record month-on-month improvement in business conditions,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement. ""New orders and output supported the latest rise with robust increases registered.""
Demand conditions continued to improve in both domestic and foreign markets, said IHS Markit, adding that the rise in new work from abroad was attributed by purchasing managers to rising demand from clients in the U.S. and Asia.
Increased manufacturing workloads contributed to the strongest job creation in over two years, IHS Markit said. Less encouraging was mounting capacity and supply chain pressures, with the latter often linked by manufacturers to coronavirus-related restrictions.
""Relatively high virus case numbers still pose a threat to the industry should restrictions tighten again,"" said Patel.
A number of Canadian provinces have announced tighter economic restrictions as a second wave of coronavirus sweeps across Canada.

Still, the data showed that Canadian manufacturers remain upbeat about their prospects for growth over the next 12 months. The measure of future output rose to a three-month high of 64.1 from 62.9 in November.

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Manufacturers across Europe ended 2020 on a high while Asian factory activity expanded moderately thanks to robust demand in regional giant China, surveys showed, but the prospect of tougher coronavirus curbs clouded the outlook for the recovery.
Despite hopes that vaccination programmes being rolled out will eventually quell the virus, a resurgence of infections is forcing many countries to reimpose strict controls on economic activity, possibly hurting large exporters such as China and Germany.
""Global manufacturing was still on a roll until the middle of December which is a very good basis for an economic rebound once the current wave of the pandemic subsides,"" said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg.
""We may have a modest setback in January as renewed lockdowns affect manufacturing but with China remaining fairly strong and the U.S. not showing significant signs of a consumer slowdown the outlook for manufacturing is still good.""
Activity in euro zone manufacturing increased at its fastest pace since mid-2018 last month, suggesting the bloc's economy was less hard hit by the pandemic than earlier in the year.
IHS Markit's final euro zone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.2 in December from November's 53.8, although that was below the initial 55.5 ""flash"" estimate. 
Anything above 50 indicates growth, and December was the highest reading since May 2018. An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 56.3 from 55.3.
Germany was again the bloc's driving force and in contrast to the dominant service industry - which has been particularly badly impacted by lockdown measures to tackle the coronavirus - factories in the region have mostly remained open.

Manufacturing activity expanded in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, according to PMI surveys, the latest indication manufacturers in Asia continue to bounce back from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
But a slowdown in China's factory activity growth underscored the challenges. China's Caixin/Markit PMI fell in December to 53.0 - its lowest level in three months - but stayed well above the 50 level.
""External demand was likely impacted by the continued global spread of COVID-19 and reimplementation of lockdowns,"" HSBC's China economist Erin Xin said in a research note.
The reading, lower than November's 54.9, fell roughly in line with the official gauge of factory activity that showed activity moderating at a high level.
Elsewhere, output stabilised in Japan for the first time in two years, while India's factory sector ended a rough 2020 on a stronger note as manufacturers boosted production to meet rising demand.

The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for December rose to 57.5 from November's 55.6, its highest since November 2017 and slightly above an initial flash estimate of 57.3.
The most recent official data, for October, showed factory output was 7.1% lower than a year earlier, largely due to reduced demand in consumer-facing industries as a result of COVID-19 shutdowns.
IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said he did not think December's surge in activity would last.
""Customers, especially those based in the EU, brought forward purchases, boosting sales temporarily. It seems likely that this boost will reverse in the opening months of 2021, making for a weak start to the year,"" he said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson reached an eleventh-hour deal with the European Union on Dec. 24, averting tariffs on goods trade with the EU. However, trade between the two economic areas will still face significant extra paperwork from Jan. 1.
The survey showed manufacturers stockpiled materials at the fastest rate since March 2019 - when there were also fears of disruption to trade with the EU - and that delivery times were the slowest since the initial lockdown in April and May.
Throughout December there were delays at British ports, culminating in a lengthy blockage at Dover (NYSE:DOV) just before Christmas after France shut the border following the identification in Britain of a new, more infectious, variant of the coronavirus.

The IHS Markit survey took place between Dec. 4 and Dec. 18, before the French action.

Germany was again the driving force and in contrast to the bloc's dominant service industry - which has been particularly badly impacted by lockdown measures to tackle the coronavirus - factories in the region have mostly remained open.
IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.2 in December from November's 53.8, although that was below the initial 55.5 ""flash"" estimate.
Anything above 50 indicates growth, and December was the highest reading since May 2018. An index measuring output, and which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good guide to economic health, rose to 56.3 from 55.3.
""The economy consequently looks set to be hit by the pandemic in the fourth quarter far less than the unprecedented decline in the second quarter thanks to the resilience of manufacturing,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Although the euro zone economy likely contracted again last quarter as renewed lockdown measures stifled activity, a December Reuters poll suggested the bloc's GDP will return to pre-crisis levels within two years. [ECILT/EU]
New orders increased amid strong demand for German goods and in part reflecting a temporary spike in British demand prior to the end of the Brexit transition period.
But despite strong demand and factories building up a backlog of orders at one of the sharpest paces in nearly three years, headcount was reduced again last month, albeit at a slower pace. The employment index nudged up to 49.2 from 48.7.
""Employment continued to be cut, but this follows a similar pattern to the recovery from the global financial crisis, with the job market improvement coming later than the rise in production,"" Williamson said.
""Assuming output growth can be sustained, jobs should soon follow.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian factory activity expanded moderately in December thanks to robust demand in regional giant China, business surveys showed on Monday, but the prospect of tougher coronavirus curbs clouded the outlook for the recovering sector.
Manufacturing activity expanded in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, according to PMI surveys, the latest indication that manufacturers in the region continue to bounce back from the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
But a slowdown in China's factory activity growth underscores the challenges the region faces as rising cases globally force many countries to reimpose curbs on economic activity, clouding the outlook for exports.

""Japanese manufacturers signalled a broad stabilisation in operating conditions at the end of a tumultuous year,"" said Usamah Bhatti, an economist at IHS Markit.
""HUGE DIVERGENCE""
The modest improvements in manufacturing activities were in contrast to sharp rises in stock prices, which some analysts say have benefited from ample global monetary stimulus but are not justified by the continued weakness in many economies.
Japan's Nikkei average ended 2020 up 66% from the year's low hit in March, even as the world's third-largest economy suffered a deep recession due to the hit from COVID-19.
A slowdown in U.S. business activity in mid-December did little to halt a surge in equities that drove up the S&P 500 index by over 16% last year.
""We're seeing a huge divergence between the dismal state of the economy and zooming stock markets, as investors price in a best-case scenario under which vaccines will help contain the pandemic this year,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research in Tokyo.
""Things might not turn out as rosy as investors believe, which means asset prices could already be experiencing a bubble. But for now, investors have little choice but to ride the tide.""
China's industrial sector has staged an impressive recovery from the coronavirus shock thanks to surprisingly strong exports, helping brighten prospects for Asia's recovery.
But a resurgence of infections is forcing some western countries to reimpose strict controls on economic activity, clouding the outlook for exports including those from China.

Japan may join other countries in applying tighter restrictions with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga signalling on Monday the chance of declaring a state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures.

Investing.com – China’s factory activity continued its recovery towards pre-COVID-19 levels, a business survey said. However, rising cost pressures are slowing the pace of expansion in the world’s second largest economy.
The Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) released earlier in the day, showed a reading of 53 for December. Although the figure stayed above the 50-level indicating expansion, it was lower than the 54.8 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 54.9 reading. Growth also eased to softest pace in three months.
Strong exports have buoyed the Chinese industrial sector towards a rapid recovery from the COVID-19 economic impact in 2020. The expected growth of around 2% in the economy for the whole of 2020 is the weakest pace of growth in over 30 years but stronger than other major economies that are seeing surges in the number of COVID-19 cases.
However, the prospect of tougher coronavirus control measures in many key trading partners in the west could dampen industrial demand and hamper the recovery. China is also dealing with its own cluster of COVID-19 cases.
The data follows National Bureau of Statistics’ release of the manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI during the previous week. The manufacturing PMI was at 51.9 in December, down from the reading of 52 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 52.1 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was at 55.7, also down from November’s reading of 56.4.
“The negative impact of the pandemic on the domestic economy further subsided and the manufacturing industry continued to recover. Both the supply and demand sides continued to improve. Overseas demand also steadily increased,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note accompanying the survey release.
The survey also showed that input prices rose at the fastest pace since 2017, with pricier raw materials, especially metals, blamed for the hike. In terms of employment, Chinese factories also laid off more workers than they hired for the first time in four months. However, the decline was modest.
“We need to pay attention to the mounting pressure on costs brought by the increase in raw material prices and its adverse impact on employment, which is particularly important for the design of the exit from stimulus policies implemented during the epidemic,” the note added.
Wang’s note remained cautiously optimistic, however. Gauges of both total new orders and factory output remained strong, although they were lower than November’s figures, and growth in new export orders also slowed.
“We expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to continue for several months, and macroeconomic indicators will be stronger in the next six months, taking into account the low bases in the first half of 2020,” the note said."

China's vast industrial sector has staged an impressive recovery from the coronavirus shock thanks to surprisingly strong exports. The economy is expected to expand around 2% for the whole of 2020 - the weakest pace in over three decades but much stronger than other major economies still struggling to contain infections.
However, tougher coronavirus control measures in many of its key trading partners in the west could dent industrial demand, weighing on the recovery.
The Caixin PMI reading comes after an official gauge of factory activity, focusing more on larger and state-owned firms, also moderated but remained strong.

The private-sector data contrasts somewhat with last week's government figures that showed industrial output growth stalled in November because of declines in car production on weakening U.S.- and Australia-bound shipments.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 50.0 in December from the previous month's 49.0 and a preliminary 49.7 reading.
The headline index hit the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for the first time since April 2019, largely because output and employment conditions stopped decreasing, ending the longest run of declines on record.
""Japanese manufacturers signalled a broad stabilisation in operating conditions at the end of a tumultuous year,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
The PMI survey also showed overall new orders declined at the softest pace since December 2018. Growth expectations for the year ahead rose on hopes that the COVID-19-induced downturn will fade and new product launches will stimulate demand.
""Businesses reported a sustained increase in optimism, with a third of respondents predicting a rise in output over the coming 12 months,"" Bhatti said.
The survey results were not completely rosy, with export orders falling at a faster rate for the second straight month thanks to restrictions recently imposed over the coronavirus in major export markets, particularly in Europe.
Purchases also fell at a quicker pace from the previous month, with lower production and order volumes leading to a reduction in raw material purchases.

New home prices in 100 cities rose 0.25% in December from a month earlier versus a 0.32% gain in November, moderating for the second straight month, according to data from China Index Academy (CIA), one of the country's largest independent real estate research firms.
More cities reported monthly gains, however, with the number climbing to 79 from 71 in November, and 19 cities saw lower home prices compared with 28 in the preceding month, the CIA data showed. 
Dongguan and Guangzhou, two cities in the southern Greater Bay Area, led the price rises. While central and northern cities like Luoyang and Zhangjiakou saw the biggest monthly price drops.
""With the government's market-cooling steps taking hold, the overall price gains remained on a mild level,"" said Cao Jingjing, Research Director with CIA.
""The cooling growth is also weighed by deepening price drops in some smaller cities which saw a withered local economy and continued population outflow.""
On an annual basis, new home prices rose 3.46% in December, versus November's 3.63% gain.
For the whole year of 2020, new home prices rose 3.46%, slightly more than 3.34% seen in 2019, the CIA data showed. 
China's property market has recovered quickly from the COVID-19 pandemic early last year, thanks to cheaper credit and looser purchase restrictions.
But with the economy nearly fully recovered to pre-coronavirus levels, policymakers have been turning their attention back to containing financial risks in the highly leveraged sector, ramping up scrutiny of financing activities of developers and buyers.
Land sales by volume rose 7% in 2020 from 2019, while the average transaction price per square metre rose 7% last year，buoyed by double-digit growth of land prices in tier-1 cities, separate CIA data showed.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports expanded at their fastest pace in 26 months in December, on robust chip demand and improved global demand, providing additional signals that the recovery is on track despite resurgences in the novel coronavirus.
Exports in the final month of 2020 grew 12.6% year-on-year, the sharpest growth since October 2018 when it grew 22.5%, government data showed on Friday.
The rate of growth was sharply higher than forecast as analysts had expected a 5.6% jump from a year earlier, and was much faster than a 4.1% growth in November.
""Semiconductor exports were exceptionally strong, with 11 of 15 major export items posting growth ... sales of IT products boosted the overall growth,"" a trade ministry official told Reuters.
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, is considered a bellwether for global trade.
Overseas sales of semiconductors surged 30% from a year earlier, marking the sharpest expansion since August 2018, towing the overall exports recovery.
Other major items such as mobile devices, displays and computers also soared 39.8%, 28.0% and 14.7% year-on-year.
By destination, exports to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, gained 3.3% from a year ago, and those to the United States and European Union jumped 11.6% and 26.4%.
Imports rose 1.8%, reversing a 1.9% decline in November and marking the best reading since April 2019. Reuters' poll had expected a 2.6% decline.
Meanwhile, for the whole of 2020, South Korea's exports slid 5.4% as the coronavirus pandemic swept world trade, but that was much better than a 10.4% fall in 2019, the worst in a decade and the third-worst in the country's modern history.

South Korea's financial markets are closed on Friday for the New Year's Day holiday and will resume trade on Monday.

(Reuters) - Fewer Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, but the modest drop did little to dispel concerns that the U.S. job market and wider economy face an arduous recovery from the devastation inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
The final major economic data point for a year that saw a recession of historic magnitude erupt out of nowhere stood as a fitting reminder for both how far the recovery has progressed and how much more it has to go.
While new claims for benefits reported by the U.S. Labor Department on Thursday dropped for the second week in a row to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 in the week ended Dec. 26 from 806,000 a week before, it left them at roughly the level they were three months ago and with little indication they would show material improvement any time soon.
The arrival of effective COVID-19 vaccines and additional federal pandemic aid have set the stage for a brighter 2021. But economists agree the still-raging epidemic and the fractured government response to it means more difficult months ahead before improvement takes hold. 
""While prospects for the economy later in 2021 are upbeat, the economy and labor market will have to navigate some difficult terrain between now and then and we expect claims to remain elevated,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note.
COVID-19's unexpected appearance late last year and rapid spread in early 2020 brought an abrupt end to a record-long U.S. economic expansion that had fostered the strongest job market in generations. It also brought down the global economy, dashing hopes for a second straight decade of uninterrupted growth and widening prosperity.
(Graphic: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/ygdvzjeekvw/joblessclaims.png)
JOBS DROP IN DECEMBER?
The report also showed that as of mid-December, more than 19.5 million people were receiving some form of jobless aid, including from emergency measures extended by the latest coronavirus aid bill that was passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump. Those emergency programs now account for roughly two-thirds of all ongoing jobless assistance. 
As of Dec. 19, the number of people continuing to draw benefits under regular state unemployment insurance programs declined to 5.219 million, the lowest since March, from 5.322 million the week before. Economists took little solace from that decline, however, seeing it more the result of people exhausting benefits rather than finding new work.
The elevated level of claims aligns with other recent weak economic reports, including a decline in consumer confidence to a four-month low in December and drops in both consumer spending and income last month. 
With persistently high COVID-19 infection levels forcing renewed restrictions on businesses and consumer activity around the country, some economists now see a chance that overall U.S. employment has fallen this month for the first time since April, when 20.8 million people lost jobs in a single month.
While payrolls have risen each month since then, the total level of employment remains roughly 10 million jobs below its pre-pandemic level.
Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), said this week the company's in-house economic activity index, which tracks the recovery through high-frequency measures, has fallen to a three-week low, led by weakness in measures of consumer spending and employment.
""Taken at face value, our data suggest further downside for retail sales and raise the prospect of an outright contraction in December employment,"" Markowska wrote. ""However, with more fiscal stimulus on the way, we expect the negative momentum to reverse in January.""
The Labor Department will issued December's employment data on Jan. 8.

PANDEMIC RELIEF TUSSLE 
The latest report's end date - Dec. 26 - was when as many as 14 million people were set to lose jobless benefits provided by a $3 trillion pandemic relief bill enacted in the spring. That was a cliff that lawmakers had raced to avoid by passing a nearly $900 billion supplemental package in the days before Christmas, including $600 payments to most individuals and extensions of unemployment benefits and eviction moratoriums. 
Trump, however, railed against the deal negotiated by his own Treasury secretary, demanding higher payments to individuals, and did not sign it into law until Sunday after extensive badgering by senior lawmakers in his Republican Party.
It was unclear whether that lapse had a material effect on last week's data or what impact it might have on the level of claims in the current week and into the new year.

""The new stimulus package is a life preserver, but containing the virus is the only way to completely end the economic chaos,"" AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said in a note. ""Even then, a full recovery will have to clear the hurdle of mounting long-term joblessness.""

1006,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 12:16AM ET</span>",Chinese Factory Activity Sees Slower Growth in December,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China’s factory activity continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace, in December. Export demand continued to fuel economic recovery, but growth was slowed by higher labor and transport costs.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day showed the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 51.9, down from the reading of 52 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and November’s 52.1 figure. The non-manufacturing PMI was at 55.7, also down from November’s reading of 56.4. Both PMIs remained above the 50-mark indicating expansion.
NBS economist Zhao Qinghe said despite the slight fall in the PMI “the overall manufacturing industry maintained a good momentum of steady recovery”
The world’s second-largest economy continued its recovery from tough COVID-19-induced lockdowns earlier in the year, with Christmas demand boosting overseas demand for manufactured goods and an uptick in domestic activity. With the pandemic largely under control in most of the country, China is still on track to be the only major economy that reported growth in 2020. Economists have forecast an expansion of around 2% for the full year, the weakest pace in over three decades but much stronger than other major economies.
Demand for medical equipment and work-from-home electric devices have continued to prop up exports, which surged in the run-up to the end of the year and the holiday season as the number of COVID-19 cases globally continue to rise incessantly.
There are over 82.6 million COVID-19 cases globally as of Dec. 31, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
However, severe cold weather and power shortages in parts of the country in December, on top of winter output restrictions in industries such as steel and coal, could weigh on production.
Tighter COVID-19 control measures in many of China’s key trading partners, including the U.S. could also put a dent in industrial demand and weigh in on the recovery.
An outbreak of COVID-19 cases has seen Beijing impose lockdowns on the impacted areas, the first since the outbreak in June and July, could also dampen demand as it comes ahead of the peak travel season.
However, some investors remained optimistic.
“It is still a level that is consistent with very solid growth,” Qian Wang, Asia-Pacific chief economist at Vanguard Group Inc., told Bloomberg.
“The Chinese economy seems to be holding up pretty well in spite of the second wave on the external side.”"

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded in December as hot export demand fueled a recovery in the world's second-largest economy from the coronavirus slump, although higher labour and transport costs slowed the pace of growth.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell to 51.9 in December from 52.1 in November, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday.
The index remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction but was a tad below the 52.0 in a Reuters' poll of analysts.
China's vast industrial sector has staged an impressive recovery from the coronavirus shock thanks to surprisingly strong exports. The economy is expected to expand around 2% for the full year - the weakest pace in over three decades but much stronger than other major economies still struggling to contain infections.
However, tougher coronavirus control measures in many of its key trading partners in the west and recent domestic infections could dent industrial demand, weighing on the recovery. 
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 51.3 in December, easing from 51.5 a month earlier. 
But an index for factory prices rose strongly, reflecting solid overseas demand as well as increased shipping costs, even though some export markets are under lockdown, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING.
Economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pickup in the industrial sector.
A sub-index for small business activity stood at 48.8 in December, sharply down from November's 50.1 and returning to contraction.
Zhao Qinghe, an official at the NBS, said in a statement accompanying the data release that small businesses were pressured by higher labour, raw material and distribution costs.
""Small manufacturers also suffer from the problem of hiring labour as the service sector in China is competing for workers,"" said Pang.
A sub-index for employment in the official PMI stood at 49.6 in December, slightly up from November's 49.5. 
China has also seen strong improvement in retail sales driven by firm demand for autos and communication equipment.
In the services sector, activity expanded for the 10th straight month, albeit at a somewhat slower clip. An indicator for construction activity rose at a faster pace.

Ahead of China's peak travel season, the capital Beijing imposed lockdowns on some COVID-infected areas, the first since the last coronavirus outbreak in the months of June and July.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 2.6% last month to 125.7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would be unchanged in November from the month before.
Compared with a year ago, pending home sales jumped 16.4% in November. Sales of existing homes have slackened recently, declining in November for the first time in six months.
The housing market is being driven by record low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home, has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out more spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus-triggered recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average 2.86%, according to the most recent data from the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Housing supply has failed to keep up with demand, boosting home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. 
Though homebuilder confidence is at historic highs, builders have complained about shortages of land and materials.

Pending home sales declined in all four regions. They fell 1.1% in the South, 4.7% in the West, 3.3% in the Northeast, and 3.1% in the Midwest.

House prices rose by 0.8% in December alone, barely slowing from the 0.9% recorded in November, and were 7.3% higher than a year earlier, well above forecasts in a Reuters poll for a 6.7% rise.
After a collapse in house purchases during the first months of lockdown, there has been a surge in demand to move house, driven in part by a temporary exemption of property purchase taxes which will expire at the end of March.
Nationwide said the strength of the housing market contrasted with weakness in some other parts of the economy - especially those exposed to renewed COVID-19 restrictions - and said the outlook for prices in 2021 was highly uncertain.
""Housing market activity is likely to slow in the coming quarters, perhaps sharply, if the labour market weakens as most analysts expect, especially once the stamp duty holiday expires at the end of March,"" Nationwide economist Robert Gardner said.
So far furlough payments and similar support for the self-employed had limited the impact of a historic 26% fall in economic output on the housing market, against most economists' earlier expectations, he added.

Demand for detached homes had risen most, with an average rise of just over 8% in the past 12 months, while prices for flats had risen by 4%.

The 3,065 foreign tourists in November is just a fraction of the 3.39 million arrivals in the same period last year. In October, there were 1,201 foreign visitors.
Though the country is gradually opening up to foreign visitors and offering incentives to boost domestic travel, efforts to revive its tourism-driven economy are being hampered by an outbreak found 10 days ago that has since infected more than 1,600 people in 43 provinces.
In the January-November period, the number of foreign visitors slumped by 81% from a year earlier to about 6.7 million of that 6.69 million were recorded in the first quarter. 
That compares with last year's nearly 40 million tourists who spent 1.91 trillion baht ($63 billion), or about 11.3% of gross domestic product.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output growth stalled in November after rising for five months, underscoring the fragile nature of the global economic recovery due to a recent resurgence in COVID-19 infections.
The world's third-largest economy recovered sharply in the third quarter from its worst postwar contraction, but lockdown measures in some major economies in response to a new wave of coronavirus infections threatens to hurt demand.
Official data released on Monday showed factory output was flat in November from the previous month, as declining output of cars and plastic products offset strength in production and general machinery output.
The flat reading was much slower than the prior month's final 4.0% gain, and below the median market forecast of a 1.2% rise in a Reuters poll of economists.
""The recovery pace is slowing a little more than expected,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
Tsunoda still expected the positive trend in output to continue largely because of underlying strength in Japan's exports, which are heavily focused on Asia.
""Demand for high-tech and IT-related products is currently expanding, so I think that will provide support,"" he said.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to decline 1.1% in December and see a sharp 7.1% rebound in January.
The government kept its assessment of industrial production unchanged, saying it was picking up.
Factory output has been recovering from a pandemic-induced downturn earlier this year, helped particularly by solid global demand for cars. Car output in November suffered from falling shipments to the United States and Australia, a government official said.
Some analysts worry that new virus infections around the world, especially in Europe and the United States, may prevent demand for Japan's manufactured goods to grow further as corporate and consumer activity take a hit.
Separate data released on Friday showed Tokyo consumer prices in December fell at their fastest pace since September 2010, while nationwide retail sales slowed in November.

Profits at Chinese industrial firms rose 15.5% from a year earlier to 729.32 billion yuan ($111.50 billion), easing from October's three-year high 28.2%, data from National Bureau of Statistics showed on Sunday. 
China's industrial sector has seen a strong rebound from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic, aided by a stunning export comeback as factories ramp up to meet demand overseas. Factory-gate prices, a gauge for profitability, fell less than expected last month. 
The pullback of growth in November was mainly due to a higher base a year earlier, said Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the statistics bureau.
""Profits at some traditional industries have showed improvement. With the approach of heating season, demand for thermal coal has risen and prices have increased, leading to an accelerated recovery in the coal sector,"" Zhu said in a statement. 
Coal industry profits rose 9.1% in November, the first increase this year. 
""Industrial profits are expected to maintain double-digit growth over the next few months, driven by low base effects, domestic economic recovery, improvements in overseas demand and the rebound in commodity prices benefiting the upstream sector,"" said analyst Zhou Maohua at China Everbright (OTC:CHFFF) Bank. 
For the January-November period, industrial firms' profits rose 2.4% from a year earlier, accelerating from the 0.7% gain recorded for the first 10 months.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 4.9% for January-November, narrowing from the 7.5% decline in the first 10 months.

U.S. ecommerce sales jumped 49% in this year's holiday shopping season, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report, underscoring the COVID-19 pandemic's role in transforming customers' shopping habits.
Holiday e-commerce sales made up 19.7% of total retail sales this year, the data showed, noting that options such as buy online and pick-up-in-store, contactless technologies were key for retailers.
The holiday shopping season can account for the majority of certain retailers' annual sales, but the health crisis meant several retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), faced with capacity constraints in certain stores, rolled out their holiday promotions early.
E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) also pushed back its annual summer promotional event to October, marking a longer-than-ever holiday season for retailers who missed out on sales for several weeks during the lockdowns earlier this year.
""This was a healthier holiday season than many had forecast,"" senior advisor for Mastercard Steve Sadove told Reuters in an interview. 
Sadove believes the digital trend will continue to grow in 2021, with smaller retailers also embracing new technology to offer customers new ways to shop. 
People spending longer at home due to extended work-from-home and remote learning policies have fueled demand for home decor and home-improvement products, with retail sales in the home furniture and furnishings category jumping 16.2% according to the report.
Electronics and appliances also rose 6% during the period, as a reduction in spending on dining out, travel and leisure encouraged shoppers to make other purchases.
Sales of apparel and jewelry slumped overall, but e-commerce sales rose 15.7% and 44.6%. 

The SpendingPulse report tracks spending by combining sales activity in Mastercard's payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms but excludes automobile sales.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Tokyo consumer prices fell the fastest in more than a decade, while Japan's jobs market and retail sales remained subdued, data showed on Friday, raising the risks of a return to deflation as the COVID-19 pandemic hammers demand.
The world's third-biggest economy recovered in the three months to September from its worst postwar contraction, but a third wave of the coronavirus infections threatens the economic revival. The Bank of Japan unveiled a plan last week to examine more effective ways to achieve its elusive 2% inflation target.
The core consumer price index (CPI) for Japan's capital, including oil products but excluding fresh food, fell 0.9% in December from a year earlier, the steepest drop since September 2010.
That was deeper than economists' median estimate for a 0.8% fall and deepened from a 0.7% decline in November. The December drop was the fastest downturn since September 2010, when core consumer prices slumped 1.0%.
Nationwide data last week for November also showed the steepest price slump since late 2010. 
""There is a chance that the nation will return to deflation due to the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""Private demand is weak as people, especially older people, stay home to keep from getting infected, making it difficult for prices to rise.""
Japan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 2.9%, better the median forecast of 3.1%, government data showed. In October, the jobless rate stood at 3.1%.
There were 1.06 jobs per applicant in November, up from the previous month's 1.04, labour ministry data showed, but still near September's seven-year low 1.03.
The pandemic remained a drag on consumer spending, with a renewed spike in infections raising fresh risks for a weakened economy. 

Japanese retail sales a moderate 0.7% in November from a year earlier, the second straight gain but slower than October's 6.4% jump and below the median market forecast for a 1.7% gain.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, though remaining elevated as more businesses face restrictions and consumers hunker down amid an explosion of new COVID-19 cases.
The raging pandemic and delays by Congress to approve another rescue package are sapping energy from the economy as the curtain closes down on a brutal year. Other data on Wednesday showed consumer spending dropping in November for the first time since the recovery from the coronavirus recession started in May. Spending was depressed by a plunge in income.
Even housing, the economy's star performer is getting tired, with sales of new single-family homes tumbling to a five-month low in November. The reports followed on the heels of data on Tuesday showing consumer confidence slumping to a four-month low in December. 
They bolstered analysts' predictions of a sharp slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter after fiscal stimulus led to a historic surge in gross domestic product in the third quarter. 
""The economy lost momentum in November,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 89,000 to a seasonally adjusted 803,000 for the week ended Dec. 19, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 885,000 applications in the latest week.
(Graphic: U.S. jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkplqqwrvb/joblessclaims.png)
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.3 million people filed claims. There were about 20.4 million people collecting unemployment benefits in early December.
Congress on Monday approved additional fiscal stimulus worth almost $900 billion, but economists said this was too little and too late. President Donald Trump has threatened not to sign the relief bill because he wants Congress to raise the amount in the stimulus checks to $2,000 for individuals, instead of the $600 that is in the legislation. 
Economists expect a chunk of the stimulus checks will be saved. Health experts also warn it could take a while for herd immunity to the virus, suggesting that more government aid would be needed to support the economy through at least summer. 
The United States is being battered by a new wave of coronavirus cases, with more than 18 million people infected and over 320,000 dead, according to a Reuters tally of official data. State and local governments have re-imposed restrictions on businesses, undercutting consumer spending and unleashing a fresh round of layoffs. 
More than $3 trillion in government aid led to a 33.4% annualized GDP growth rate in the third quarter following a 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June period.
Though jobless claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. Some economists attributed the surprise drop in claims last week to states cracking down on fraud. Claims are also volatile this time of the year.
""The labor market is still much worse than it was before the pandemic, and the pace of improvement has slowed since the summer,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
U.S. stocks were higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
INCOME FALLING
A second report from the Commerce Department showed consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 0.4% in November after gaining 0.3% in October. Consumers cut back on purchases of goods like new motor vehicles, clothing and footwear, offsetting increases in spending on food and beverages from supermarkets and liquor stores. They also slashed spending at restaurants and bars, as well as on accommodation and household electricity and gas.
Personal income decreased 1.1% in November, pulled down by the expiration of a government loan program for businesses hit by COVID-19. There were also declines in coronavirus-related government payments to farmers and ranchers, as well as unemployment subsidies. It was the fifth drop in income in seven months. As a result, Americans dipped into savings. The saving rate fell to a still-high 12.9% from 13.6% in October. 
With consumer spending weak, inflation remained muted. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components increased 1.4% year-on-year in November, matching October's gain. The so-called core PCE index is the preferred inflation measure for the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average.

A third report from the Commerce Department showed business spending rising in November, though the pace has slowed. Still, business investment could blunt some of the impact of slowing consumer spending and keep the economy on a moderate growth path this quarter.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.4% last month after jumping 1.6% in October.
The department also reported that new home sales plunged 11.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 841,000 units last month, the lowest level since June.
(Graphic: U.S. new home sales - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qzjpqddjzvx/nhs.png)
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate. Economists expect modest growth or even a contraction in the first quarter of 2021. 

""Risks are skewed to the downside for growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.

New home sales tumbled 11.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 841,000 units last month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. October's sales pace was revised down to 945,000 units from the previously reported 999,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 11.2% of housing market sales, slipping 0.3% to a rate of 995,000 units in November. New home sales are drawn from a sample of houses selected from building permits and tend to be volatile month-to-month.
New home sales jumped 20.8% on a year-on-year basis. The government reported last week that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, rose in November to the highest level since April 2007.
But persistent shortages of land, materials and skilled labor are raising construction costs for builders. A report on Tuesday showed sales of previously owned homes fell in November after five straight monthly increases.
The housing market, the economy's star performer, is being supported by pent-up demand and historically low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has left 21.8% of the labor force working from home. That has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schooling.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.67 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). That is the lowest rate since the agency started tracking the data in 1971.
In November, new home sales fell in all four regions.

The median new house price rose 2.2% to $335,300 in November from a year ago. There were 286,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 281,000 from October. At November's sales pace it would take 4.1 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 3.6 months in October.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.7% in November. Core capital goods orders increased 0.8% year-on-year in November.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted demand away from services like travel and hospitality towards goods. Orders last month were boosted by demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components, computers and electronic products, primary metals and machinery.
Shipments of core capital goods increased 0.4% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They surged 2.6% in October.
Business investment on equipment rebounded strongly in the third quarter after five straight quarterly declines. Spending on equipment could help to blunt the impact of slower consumer spending on GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Consumer spending is being hampered by a resurgence in new coronavirus infections and a delay by Congress to approve another rescue package.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% annualized rate. The economy rebounded at a record 33.4% rate in the third quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rose 0.9% in November after advancing 1.8% in October.
Durable goods orders were lifted by 1.9% jump in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 1.5% advance in October. Orders for civilian aircraft fell 2.8%. A rebound in likely after the government ended a 20-month grounding of Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s best-selling 737 MAX jets after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.

Orders for motor vehicles and parts increased 2.4% in November.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell unexpectedly last week, but remained above 800,000 for the third week in a row.
The Labor Department said there were 803,000 initial claims last week, down from 892,000 the week before. The previous week’s numbers were revised up by 7,000 and were the highest since early September.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones, fell to 5.337 million, from 5.507 million. Economists had expected an increase of some 50,000 ahead of time. Even so, with another 14 million Americans enrolled in two other pandemic-related unemployment benefit programs, the total number of those receiving benefits remained at over 20 million as of December 5th. 
The figures reflect sustained pressure on the economy from the most recent wave of the pandemic, which has seen states and cities shut a large part of their economies to stop the spread of Covid-19. Infection curves are now starting to flatten, but the number of people admitted to hospital with the disease remains at a record high of over 117,000.
Other data released Wednesday reflected similar trends: personal income fell by 1.1% in November, more than expected and the biggest drop in four months, as many Americans' eligibility for enhanced unemployment benefits expired.  At the same time, durable goods orders rose by the least in seven months, at only 0.4%. Spending on durable goods, especially electronics and furnishings, has held up relatively well this year as households have diverted spending away from services in response to being locked down or forced to work from home.
The figures are the first to be released Congress approved a $900 billion relief package that aims to provide a safety net for those who have lost their work due to the pandemic and the public health measures imposed in order to contain it. The new bill includes another 11-week extension for enhanced unemployment benefits, as well as direct payments of $600 for those on low and medium incomes, with additional payments for dependents. 
The bill, which also includes an extension of the ban on evictions, should help cushion the recent slowdown in the economy, 
President Donald Trump late Tuesday demanded changes to the package before he would sign it, arguing for bigger direct checks to households. The bill passed both chambers of Congress with veto-proof majorities.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian firms turned most optimistic in the fourth quarter this year, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed, as business activity picked up in the region and COVID-19 vaccines started rolling out in Western countries ahead of their Asian launch.
The outlook for Asian companies in the next six months tracked by the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index jumped to 62 this quarter from 53 in the third quarter.
The latest number according to the survey of 101 firms across 11 Asia-Pacific countries was the highest since the fourth quarter of 2019. A reading above 50 indicates a positive outlook.
""There's a sense of optimism going forward,"" said Antonio Fatas, Singapore-based economics professor at global business school INSEAD.
""Things are getting better but they are getting better with still a dose of uncertainty. The effect of the crisis is very different across sectors,"" he added, noting the weakness in the transport sector due to curbs on global travel.
Still, more than half the respondents polled flagged persistent cases of the novel coronavirus as well as the possible scarcity of vaccines in parts of the world - at least initially - as their biggest risk.
While the United States and Britain have already started vaccinating their populations, few Asian countries expect to get significant amounts of coronavirus vaccines in coming weeks.
Some Asian countries are still running their own late-stage trials of vaccines, while others are allowing time to check for any side effects in people inoculated elsewhere.
A quarter of the companies in the survey, which was conducted between Dec. 4-18, were most concerned about businesses cutting jobs, which would hurt consumption.
Yet others flagged as their top risks a withdrawal of stimulus by central banks, and newly elected United States President Joe Biden keeping a tough line on China.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought on the worst global economic slowdown since the Great Depression, with millions of jobs lost and industries brought to their knees.
Still, Asia, which has had greater success in controlling the virus than Europe and the United States, is leading hopes of an economic recovery.

A recovery to pre-pandemic levels in China, the world's second-largest economy, has fuelled revival hopes. Equity markets in China, South Korea and Taiwan are up at least 20% this year, leading the region's gains.
According to the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) INSEAD survey, some 44% of the companies polled in the fourth quarter were positive about their outlook for the next six months, up sharply from 28% in the third quarter and nearly 8% in the second.
About 58% of the firms said they did not hire or lay off people this quarter, and a fifth said staffing levels were lower. This was similar to numbers in the third quarter. In the second quarter, 62% of the companies said they had cut jobs.
""While I still see some uncertainty, the numbers are good,"" said Fatas. ""It looks like a recovery that is taking speed and where more businesses feel confident.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence dropped for a second straight month in December as a deterioration in the labor market amid renewed business restrictions to slow the raging pandemic offset the rolling out of a vaccine for COVID-19.
The decline in confidence to a four-month low reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday was the latest indication that the economic recovery from the pandemic was losing steam, also because of delays by Congress to approve another rescue package.
The government confirmed on Tuesday that the economy grew at a historic pace in the third quarter, juiced up by more than $3 trillion in pandemic relief. Congress on Monday approved additional fiscal stimulus worth almost $900 billion, but economists said this was insufficient and too late to counter a bleak winter of rising coronavirus infections and layoffs.
""The storm clouds are growing darker and the worst may be yet to come,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The new coronavirus outbreak means the economy will be flirting with disaster in the first quarter of 2021 where a downturn is possible despite Congress throwing more money our way."" 
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 88.6 this month, the lowest since August, from 92.9 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index ticking up to 97.0 in December. The index was at 132.6 in February. The cut-off date for the survey was Dec. 14. 
Two vaccines have since been approved for use to combat the respiratory illness, which economists believe will limit further downside in consumer confidence. 
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, tumbled to a reading of 90.3 this month from 105.9 in November. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions increased to 87.5 from a reading of 84.3 in November.
The United States is struggling with a resurgence in new coronavirus cases, with more than 17.78 million people infected and over 317,800 dead, according to a Reuters tally of official data. State and local governments have re-imposed restrictions on businesses, undercutting consumer spending and unleashing a fresh wave of layoffs. 
The decline in consumer confidence followed data this month showing the economy in November added the fewest jobs since the jobs recovery started in May. Retail sales decreased in November for a second straight month and the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits is at three-month high. 
The worsening employment outlook was underscored by the Conference Board survey, which showed its so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, tumbled to a reading of -0.2 this month from 6.9 in November. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It was as high as 38.3 in August last year.

December's contraction strengthens economists' expectations for a decline in nonfarm payrolls this month. The government will publish December's employment report in January.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
LITTLE SPEED
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income rose to 16.8% from 16.0% in November. The proportion anticipating a drop slipped to 14.3% from 14.5% last month. 
Fewer consumers expected to purchase homes and motor vehicles over the next six months, relative to November's survey. But more consumers planned purchases of appliances like refrigerators and television sets.
That suggests some cooling ahead for housing, the star of the recovery. A separate report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday show existing home sales fell 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million units in November. That followed five straight monthly increases.

The housing market is being driven by record low interest rates, but surging home prices amid a dearth of properties is sidelining many first-time buyers.
Robust housing and consumer spending helped to power the economy last quarter. Gross domestic product rebounded at a 33.4% annualized rate in the July-Sept quarter, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of GDP on Tuesday. That was revised up from the 33.1% pace reported last month and recouped two thirds of output lost during the pandemic.

The economy plunged into recession in February and output remains 3.4% below its level at the end of 2019. The economy contracted at a 31.4% rate in the April-June quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Twenty-one industries led by the automobile sector contributed to GDP growth last quarter. Mining was the only drag as cheaper oil weighed on businesses' spending on residential structures like gas and oil well drilling. 
Corporate profits also rebounded strongly last quarter. But performance has been overtaken by the relentless pandemic, leaving GDP growth estimates for the fourth quarter around a 5% rate. Most economists expect modest growth or even a contraction in the first three months of 2021.

""On the eve of 2021, the economy carries very little momentum,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The Conference Board said on Tuesday its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 88.6 this month from 92.9 in November. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index ticking up to 97.0 in December. The index was at 132.6 in February.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell more than expected in November after five straight month of gains amid a shortage of properties and more expensive houses, but the housing market remains underpinned by record low mortgage rates.
The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday that existing home sales fell 2.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.69 million units last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales declining 1.0% to a rate of 6.70 million units in November.
Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, surged 25.8% on a year-on-year basis in November. 
Sales fell in the South, Midwest and Northeast. They were flat in the West. 
The housing market has been the economy's star performer, thanks to pent-up demand and historically low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic has left 21.8% of the labor force working from home. That has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.67 percent, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). That is the lowest rate since the agency started tracking the data in 1971.
Housing supply has failed to keep up with demand, pushing home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. The government reported last week that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, increased in November to the highest level since April 2007.
In November, there were 1.28 million previously owned homes on the market, a record low and down 22% from a year ago. The median existing house price jumped 14.6% from a year ago to $310,800 in November. Sales were concentrated in upper price segment of the market.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week though the U.S. central bank was monitoring house prices and those of other assets, ""from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not of a level of concern right now."" Powell said the higher prices were ""just reflective of a lot of demand.""

At November's sales pace, it would take a record low 2.3 months to exhaust the current inventory. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery from its coronavirus crash was quicker than previously thought in the third quarter, according to official data, but new lockdowns are threatening to cause a another recession.
Tuesday's data also showed government borrowing sped up last month to pay for the mounting cost of the coronavirus crisis.
Gross domestic product grew by a record 16.0% from July to September, revised up from a previous estimate of 15.5%.
But that still did not make up for its 18.8% slump in the second quarter, when much of the economy was shut down.
Britain's economy was hit harder by the pandemic than most others as it went into a longer lockdown. Only Italy has recorded more deaths in Europe.
Now London and nearby areas are back under tough restrictions as the government tries to slow the spread of a new variant of the virus that spreads more easily.
Capital Economics, a consultancy, said a double-dip recession was a clear possibility if the latest COVID-19 restrictions continue into 2021.
The economy almost ground to a halt in October and is expected to shrink again in the fourth quarter as worries about the Dec. 31 deadline for a Brexit trade deal with the European Union compound the damage from COVID-19.
But Capital Economics said a high savings rate among households ""provides optimism that as long as vaccines are effective and widespread, GDP will stage a strong rebound in the second half of next year.""
Tuesday's data showed the economy was 8.6% below where it was at the end of 2019.
It also showed household incomes grew in the third quarter as workers returned from temporary layoffs. Consumer spending rose by almost 20%.
The Office for National Statistics also said Britain borrowed a record 241 billion pounds ($323 billion) in the first eight months of the financial year, nearly 190 billion pounds more than in the same period a year earlier.
Borrowing in November alone reached 31.6 billion pounds, up more than 40% from October as the government extended its job- retention scheme to cover workers hit by the latest lockdowns.
The deficit is on course to widen to about 400 billion pounds in the 2020/21 year, close to 20% of GDP, double the hit from the global financial crisis.
Public debt stood at almost 2.1 trillion pounds or 99.5% of GDP, the highest ratio since 1962.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak reiterated his pledge to tackle the huge shortfall, but not immediately.
""When our economy recovers, it's right that we take the necessary steps to put the public finances on a more sustainable footing,"" he said.
The International Monetary Fund has said Britain will probably need to raise taxes after the pandemic to fill the gap.
Britain's current account deficit - one of the economy's weak spots - widened to 15.7 billion pounds, or 2.9% of GDP.

The GfK research institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -7.3 points from a revised -6.8 in the previous month.
This marked the lowest reading since July and came in slightly better than a Reuters forecast of -8.8.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders imposed a ""lockdown lite"" from Nov. 2, under which restaurants, bars and entertainment venues were closed while shops remained open.
As the measures failed to push down infection numbers, the government put in place stricter curbs from Dec. 16 which have shuttered most stores as well hair salons and other services.
""At present, the savings indicator is the main factor driving the third decline in a row in the consumer climate,"" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said.
The survey chimes with data that showed a temporary reduction in sales tax, put in place by the government to stimulate domestic demand, has failed to turn anxious savers into big spenders.
As long as new COVID-19 cases remain high there is no improvement in sight which means any recovery can only be expected when infections drop so far that curbs can be loosened again, Buerkl said.
Senior government officials have said they expect the stricter lockdown measures, so far announced until at least Jan. 10, to be extended well into the new year.

The Confederation of British said its monthly retail sales balance rose to -3 in December from -25 in November, its highest level in three months.
But the outlook for January was much more negative with a reading of -33.
""It says something about the challenges the retail sector has faced during 2020 that stable sales volumes in the run-up to Christmas were seen as a good result for the time of year,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said. 
""The new year looks set for an unpromising start, with retailers anticipating a sharp fall in sales in January.""
The survey was conducted between Nov. 23 and Dec. 14, covering the end of a second English coronavirus lockdown, when non-essential shops were closed - and the return to tiered restrictions.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday a new tougher lockdown for London and nearby parts of England.
Grocers, furniture vendors and retailers of other ""normal goods,"" such as cards, flowers and jewellery, saw strong growth, according to the CBI survey.
But clothing, footwear and department stores again reported that volumes were lower than a year earlier.
The CBI said stock levels were viewed as broadly adequate for expected sales, but the balance of responses was the lowest in more than a decade.

1032,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 20, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>",China's stunning export comeback has factories scrambling for workers,"By Gabriel Crossley and Stella Qiu
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's manufacturing recovery, fuelled in part by demand from COVID-constrained consumers abroad, has soared past expectations this year, so much so that factories are now struggling to fill a shortage of blue-collar workers to clear mounting orders.
The country's output of industrial robots, computer equipment, and integrated circuits has roared back from its coronavirus paralysis - production for the year to November is up 22.2%, 10.1% and 15.9%, respectively.
Much of the manufacturing boom has come from foreign demand, with export growth topping expectations for eight of the last nine months.
The remarkable turnaround comes as China has mostly eradicated the virus and contrasts with the sluggish comebacks seen in major industrialised peers, where factories are still struggling with pandemic disruptions and the hit to demand.
China's global export share increased to over 13% in the second and third quarters from 11% last year, according to Nomura, the highest for any quarter since at least 2006 when the investment bank started compiling the data.
While emergency stimulus in the United States and Europe pumped money into consumers' wallets, the fight to contain the virus in those markets fired up demand both for China-made PPE goods and gadgets for westerners stuck at home.
Government data shows that in November there were more people employed in the industrial sector in Jinhua city, which includes the eastern export hub of Yiwu, than there had been at any time since end-2017. 
""We laid off about 50 workers in the first half, and now with orders soaring, we're short of staff and not able to further ramp up production,"" said Deng Jinling, who owns a thermal flask factory in Yiwu, selling to the Middle East, United States and Europe.
""We tried hiring dozens of temporary workers but they're not good enough,"" said Deng. 
Some workers she laid off have found jobs back home and are not willing to travel back just a few months before the upcoming Lunar New Year holidays in February.
But with clients chasing her heels, Deng bought two automated production lines at the end of November to boost efficiency.
""We've never thought about doing this before, but this year has been so busy and we've exhausted our options,"" she said. ""One automated production line is the equivalent of 10 workers."" 
A private index by Renmin University tracking demand for blue-collar labour hit a record in the third quarter. Some factory managers have hiked wages by 25% to 10,000 yuan ($1,530) per month, well above the average starting wage for graduates, according to local media. 
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) YEAR
For China's bicycle industry, 2020 is the best year in a decade, with consumers abroad craving exercise and ways to avoid public transport, said Liang Xiaoling, general manager at Guangzhou-headquartered Trinx Bikes.
""Our capacity maxed out in September and October, and we hired a lot of temporary workers to catch up with the demand,"" said Liang, adding that orders are now stretching into 2022.
His factories now employ about 100 extra temporary workers on top of 1,000 or so regular staff.
Although manufacturing investment was slow to recover, falling 3.5% over the first 11 months, strong export demand helped it rebound in the last quarter. 
Investment jumped 12.5% year-on-year in November, up from 3.7% in October, according to research from analysts at CICC, an investment bank. 
Zhang Qinming, who owns a company manufacturing speakers for European and American markets, says demand is 25% higher than in previous years. 
He's been paying his normal staff overtime to keep up and has also hired temporary workers for about 18-19 yuan an hour, 20% more than his full-time workers. As a last resort, he's leased other factories to take the load.
LIMITED OPPORTUNITY
A labour crunch isn't the only constraint.
China's lopsided trade balance - exporting three containers for every one imported recently - and delays in containers returning to China due to the pandemic overseas, have created severe shipping bottlenecks, now starting to pinch exports.
The yuan is also hovering near multi-year peaks against the dollar, pressuring profits further. And an official gauge of factory raw materials costs reached the highest level since 2017 in November. 
Despite the red-hot demand, Liang, of Trinx Bikes, said profits are being squeezed. ""Some of our orders are already seeing some losses,"" he said.
But for policymakers, the export boom has been a welcome one in a tough year. The surprising resilience of China's export sector, which employs around 180 million people, has reduced the need for massive stimulus to revive the economy this year, said analysts.
China hit 122% of its annual job creation target by end-November.
But manufacturers don't expect this boom to last as other economies ramp up production.
""It started with the pandemic, so it will end with the vaccine rollout,"" said Liang.

Lloyds said its monthly business barometer rose by 17 percentage points to -4% in December, its highest since March, before the coronavirus pandemic hit Britain's economy.
""The news of the vaccine progress has bolstered this month’s confidence figures, more than offsetting uncertainties around the UK's new trading relationship with the EU,"" Lloyds economist Hann-Ju Ho said.
The improved business sentiment mirrors a similar gains among households whose confidence rose this month by the largest margin in eight years, according to a survey last week from market researchers GfK.
The immediate economic backdrop is weak. Britain's economy is on course to shrink 11% this year, the most since 1709, according to the Bank of England, while growth in early 2021 looks set to be hampered by ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.
Lloyds said 32% of firms it surveyed expected to cut staff next year, and 22% planned to increase numbers. Larger businesses tended to be more upbeat, and also more likely to plan to end pay freezes.

The survey was based on a poll of 1,200 firms conducted between Nov. 25 and Dec. 10.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. current account deficit surged to its highest level in more than 12 years in the third quarter as a record rebound in consumer spending pulled in imports, outpacing a recovery in exports.
The Commerce Department said on Friday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened 10.6% to $178.5 billion last quarter. That was the highest since the second quarter of 2008.
Data for the second quarter was revised to show a $161.4 billion shortfall, instead of $170.5 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the current account gap increasing to $189.0 billion in the July-September quarter.
The current account gap represented 3.4% of gross domestic product in the third quarter. That was up from 3.3% in the April-June quarter and the largest since the fourth quarter of 2008. Still, the deficit remains below a peak of 6.3% of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2005 as the United States is now a net exporter of crude oil and fuel. 
Imports of goods increased $94.4 billion to $602.7 billion, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2019. The broad rise in response to pent-up demand following the easing of business restrictions to slow the spread of COVID-19, was led by imports of passenger cars. 
Imports of services rose $6.5 billion to $107.7 billion, mostly reflecting increases in fees for intellectual property, mainly licenses for research and development. There were also increases in sea freight transportation and personal travel.
Consumer spending grew at a historic 40.6% annualized rate in the July-September period, driven by more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief. Consumer spending contracted at a record 33.2% pace in the second quarter.
Exports of goods rebounded $68.4 billion to $357.1 billion last quarter. The broad increase in exports was led by shipments of motor vehicles, parts and engines. Exports plunged in the April-June period amid coronavirus shutdowns overseas.
Exports of services gained $2.8 billion to $164.8 billion. That mainly reflected an increase in fees for research and development licenses. But education-related travel declined. 
Primary income receipts rose $26.8 billion to $238.7 billion, driven by investment income, mostly earnings.

Secondary income climbed $1.4 billion to $35.3 billion, lifted by an increase in private sector fines and penalties.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales fell sharply last month when a four-week lockdown in England closed stores which sold non-essential goods to the public, official figures showed on Friday.
Retail sales volumes dropped by 3.8% on the month in November, their biggest decline since the first lockdown in April and broadly in line with the forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, after a 1.3% increase in October.
Annual sales growth halved to 2.4% from 5.8%, the Office for National Statistics said.
Retail has been one of the few bright spots in Britain's economy since the COVID pandemic, which the Bank of England estimates has caused Britain's economy to shrink 11% over the course of 2020, the biggest slump since 1709.
Consumer confidence data for December, released earlier on Friday, showed the biggest jump in eight years as households welcomed news of the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.
However the picture has been extremely mixed across the retail sector, with online retailers booming and supermarkets enjoying solid results, but many clothing retailers struggling from the closure of their high-street premises.
Inflation data on Wednesday showed the biggest annual fall in clothing and footwear prices in a decade, due in part to unusually large Black Friday discounts.

The BoE estimates Britain's economy as a whole will shrink by just over 1% in the final quarter of 2020, slightly less than it feared a month ago, but expects slower growth in early 2021 due to longer-lasting lockdown restrictions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government raised its economic growth forecast for the next fiscal year thanks to its latest stimulus package aimed at speeding up the recovery following the damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.
The economy is expected to grow 4.0% in price-adjusted real terms in the next fiscal year starting April 2021, the latest estimate by the Cabinet Office showed on Friday.
The new estimate compared with its previous forecast of 3.4% growth projected in July. 
The upgrade was underpinned by the government's third supplementary budget, which was approved earlier this week, to fund the $708 billion stimulus package to help the economy recover from its COVID-induced slump in the second quarter.
The forecast 4.0% growth for next fiscal year would be the fastest annual expansion on record, if realized, since comparable data became available in 1995, the Cabinet Office said.
The government, which expects the economy will return to pre-COVID-19 levels by January-March 2022 helped by its broad policy support, also cautioned about risks.
Policymakers need to keep a close watch ""on downside risks to the economy in Japan and overseas from the pandemic and impacts from moves in financial capital markets,"" an official at the Cabinet Office said.
The government will use the forecasts to finalize the state budget for the next fiscal year.
For the current fiscal year that ends in March 2021, the government cut its gross domestic product forecast to a 5.2% contraction, which would be the biggest annual slump on record.
Previously, it projected the economy to shrink 4.5%.
Consumer prices remain subdued due to weak domestic demand and the government' discount travel campaign to support the tourism industry. 
Overall consumer prices are forecast to fall 0.6% for this fiscal year, from a 0.3% decline expected previously. 

In fiscal 2021, overall prices will grow 0.4%, the government said, revised down slightly from the previous forecast of a 0.5% increase.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week as a relentless wave of new COVID-19 infections hobbled business operations, offering more evidence that the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession was faltering.
That was underscored by other data on Thursday showing manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region cooled in December, with factories reporting a sharp slowdown in new orders and job growth. But the housing market remains resilient, with homebuilding and permits powering ahead in November, thanks to record-low mortgage rates and pent-up demand.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the moderation in economic activity following a record growth spurt in the third quarter. Powell cautioned that ""the path ahead remains highly uncertain."" The U.S. central bank kept its main interest rate near zero and pledged to continue injecting more money into the economy through asset purchases. 
""The coronavirus pandemic has split the economy in two where the winners are interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing and the stock market, while the losers employed in the leisure and hospitality industries are falling further and further behind,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 885,000 for the week ended Dec. 12. The second straight weekly increase lifted claims to their highest level since September. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 800,000 applications in the latest week. 
GRAPHIC: Jobless claims - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkvlqbyypb/joblessclaims.png 
Jobless claims are way above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March. The weekly unemployment claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, followed in the wake of data on Wednesday showing retail sales declined for a second straight month in November.
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the state unemployment programs, 1.4 million people filed claims. California and Illinois led the increase in applications, with layoffs concentrated in the services industries.
The United States is battling a fresh coronavirus outbreak, with at least 16.7 million infected and more than 304,000 dead, according to a Reuters tally. State and local government have responded with renewed restrictions on businesses, while some consumers are avoiding crowded places like shopping malls, restaurants and bars. California, home to nearly 40 million people, imposed new tough stay-at-home orders last week.
The restrictions and reduced income as millions of unemployed and underemployed lost a government-funded weekly subsidy is undercutting consumer spending, which will lead to more job losses. Though a COVID-19 vaccine is being deployed, health experts say it could take months for herd immunity. 
Congress moved closer on Thursday to a $900 billion rescue package. Economists said the new fiscal stimulus could limit, but not fully offset weaker consumer spending and prevent further layoffs. More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief powered the economy in the third quarter.
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
HOUSING SHINES
In a separate report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index dropped to a reading of 11.1 this month from 26.3 in November. Measures of new orders and shipments at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware also fell. 
The survey's gauge of factory employment declined and as did a measure of the workweek. A report this week from the New York Fed also showed a moderation in manufacturing in December.

The housing market has so far been unscathed by the pandemic. But spiraling infections are causing raw material shortages. Lumber prices have soared, which could slow the housing market momentum. 
Housing starts rose 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.547 million units in November, with single-family homebuilding hitting its highest level since April 2007, the Commerce Department said in a third report. Permits for future homebuilding raced 6.2% to a rate of 1.639 million units, the highest since September 2006.

Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed establishments for the nonfarm payrolls portion of December's employment report. Economists expect a decrease in employment this month. 
""The rise comes during the payroll survey week, and increases the odds of a negative print for December,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The economy, which plunged into recession in February, added the fewest jobs in six months in November. Only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered. 
The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 273,000 to 5.508 million in the week ending Dec. 5, but that was because many have exhausted their eligibility, limited to six months in most states. 
At least 4.8 million people filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 28, up 268,532 from the prior week. These benefits as well as those for gig workers and the self-employed will lapse next Saturday. 

About 21 million people were collecting benefits under all programs at the end of November.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>","U.S. housing starts, building permits power ahead in November","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding and permits increased solidly in November, pointing to sustained housing market strength even as the broader economic recovery is slowing amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases and lack of additional government money. 
Housing starts rose 1.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.547 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That lifted homebuilding closer to its pace of 1.567 million units in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts holding steady at a rate of 1.530 million units in November. Homebuilding surged 12.8% on a year-on-year basis. 
Permits for future homebuilding raced 6.2% to a rate of 1.639 million units in November. Permits typically lead starts by one to two months. 
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, rose 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.186 million units, the highest level since April 2007.
Single-family starts have increased for seven straight months. The housing market is defying slowing economic growth, thanks to pent-up demand and historically low mortgage rates. Recent data have shown a moderation in the labor market and consumer spending half-way through the fourth quarter as the country battles a fresh wave of COVID-19 cases.
The coronavirus pandemic has left 21.8% of the labor force working from home. That has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schools. 
Lower-wage earners have borne the brunt of the recession, which started in February. 
Though a survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders eased in December, it remained near November's all-time high. Builders worried about rising construction costs, noting persistent shortages of land, materials and skilled labor.
Single-family building permits jumped 1.3% to a rate of 1.143 million units in November. Homebuilding is being driven by lean inventories, especially for previously owned homes. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.71%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment accelerated 4.0% to a pace of 361,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects soared 19.2% to a rate of 496,000 units.

But rising rental vacancy rates remain a challenge for the multi-family housing market. Renters are also moving away from city centers to suburban apartments in search of a more outdoor lifestyle.

1041,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",U.S. Housing Starts Rose For a Third-Straight Month in November,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. new home construction rose more than forecast to a nine-month high in November, highlighting the strength of a residential housing market that’s been supported by strong demand amid low interest rates.
Residential starts rose 1.2% to a 1.547 million annualized rate from an downwardly revised 1.528 million a month earlier, according to government report released Thursday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 1.535 million pace.
The figures underscore strong demand for new homes thanks to record-low mortgage rates and buyers looking for bigger spaces during the pandemic. Housing has been a bright spot in the economy, with new home construction now nearly back to February’s level.
Still, housing may face headwinds as the worsening spread of the virus prompts fresh restrictions and stimulus talks in Washington remain unresolved.
Single-family starts rose for a seventh month to a 1.186 million annualized rate that was the highest since 2007, while starts for projects with five or more units, a category that tends to be volatile and includes apartments and condos, increased to 352,000.
A separate report Wednesday showed that U.S. homebuilder confidence eased slightly in December to the second-best level on record following the prior month’s peak.
Meanwhile, a separate report Thursday showed that applications for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly jumped last week to the highest level in three months.
Strength new construction was broad-based nationally. Housing starts climbed in all four regions, led by a 12.9% rise in the Northeast, according to the report, which is published jointly by the Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, rose to 1.639 million, the highest since 2006.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose again to a new three-month high last week, indicating that the pace of layoffs due to the latest wave of the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating.
The Labor Department said 885,000 initial claims were filed last week, and revised the previous week’s number up by 12,000 to 865,000. Economists had counted on a decline to 800,000.
That’s the highest level since early September. The news comes a day after figures showing that retail sales fell 1.1% in November, their first monthly decline in six months.  Together, the figures show a clear loss of momentum in the economy under pressure from a pandemic that has gained in strength with the onset of winter and with the increased transmission opportunities created by the election campaign and the holiday shopping season.
The number of people filing continuing jobless claims fell however, to 5.508 million from an upwardly revised 5.781 million. That was bigger than the expected drop, but economists warned against seeing it as a sign of improvement. 
""The drop in continuing claims is not a sign of improving labor market conditions,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist with Grant Thornton, via Twitter. ""Long-term unemployed are running out of benefits and shifting into special pandemic insurance, which is slated to expire unless Congress acts before year end.""
There was further evidence of the slowdown as the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's monthly business survey showed a sharp drop in its main manufacturing index to 11.1 from 26.3, with declines in all of its sub-indices: prices paid, employment and new orders. 
However, there was slightly better news from the housing market, which has been a source relative of strength all through the pandemic. The number of housing starts rose 1.2% on the month to 1.547 million, their highest since March. Building permits, meanwhile, rose 6.2% on the month to their highest in over 12 years."

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was down 0.3% both month-on-month and year-on-year, the same annual decline as in September and October and in line with the initial estimates released at the start of December.
Food, alcohol and tobacco added 0.36 percentage points to the final results, Eurostat said, and services another 0.25 points, but an 8.3% year-on-year plunge in energy prices subtracted 0.82 percentage points from the final number.
Non-energy industrial goods also reduced annual inflation by 0.07 points. 
Without volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, what the European Central Bank (ECB) calls core inflation, prices were down 0.4% month-on-month and up 0.4% year-on-year.
An even narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco showed a 0.5% month-on-month decline and a 0.2% year-on-year increase.
The ECB wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2% over the medium term.
Across the euro zone, the highest inflation was 1.1% in Austria. Declines were sharpest in Greece at 2.1%, Estonia at 1.2% and Slovenia and Cyprus both 1.1%. 
In the bloc's largest and third largest economies, Germany and Italy, inflation was negative. It was up by just 0.2% in France, the euro zone's second largest economy.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australians packed into shopping malls on Thursday to stock up on supplies for the Christmas holiday season, spending money that might usually go toward overseas travel and cheering an annual rite that was threatened by the new coronavirus.
With travel and many social activities curtailed for most of the year by restrictions on movement intended to slow the virus, consumers have turned to home cooking and entertainment for their leisure - and spent up.
Australian retail sales rebounded a stronger-than-expected 1.4% in October, the most recent period covered by official data, and other figures have pointed to a solid recovery in the A$2 trillion ($1.5 trillion) economy.
Much of the spending has gone to online merchants, but with movement restrictions easing amid low numbers of new infections, shoppers have started returning to physical stores.
""I thought maybe we would be doing a lot more online shopping, so I feel really lucky that we can go into stores and have that physical experience,"" said Jordan McCormack, a holiday shopper in Sydney. ""When you look around at how busy the mall is, it's like old times.""
Laticia Francini, another shopper on a muggy summer's day in Sydney, said she had family in Italy where lockdowns had resumed following a rise in cases, so ""we're one of the luckiest countries in the world right now"".
Australia ended a weeks-long run without community transmissions with the most populous state, New South Wales, reporting three locally acquired cases in the previous 24 hours.
Industry body the Australian Retailers Association said it expects sales after Christmas Day on Dec. 25, when many stores offer discounts, to increase 3.9% over the same period a year earlier as people cash in on a swag of stimulus payments.
""The Australian economy is bouncing back,"" said association CEO Paul Zahra in a statement. ""Consumer confidence is on the rise, people are heading back to their favourite shops, and that's reflected in these figures.""

The economy shrank 4.6% in the third quarter, rebounding slightly from the 7% slump in the previous quarter but marked by declines in both the oil and non-oil sectors, the data showed.
Saudi Arabia is facing its worst economic decline in decades after the COVID-19 pandemic curbed global crude demand and measures to contain it also hurt other sectors.
The world's largest oil exporter said on Tuesday it expects the economy to shrink by 3.7% this year but to swing back to growth of 3.2% next year.
""This negative growth originated mainly from the contraction in the oil sector by 8.2% and a negative growth rate of 2.1% recorded in the non-oil sector,"" the General Authority for Statistics said on Thursday about the third quarter data.

1047,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 02:33PM ET</span>","Fed Holds Rates Steady, Signals Low Rates Here to Stay Through 2023","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com – The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday, and signaled that near-zero rates would continue through 2023 to support the next phase of the economic recovery as the vaccine rollout gets underway.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25%. 
The low-rate environment will continue for some time, with policymakers backing rates to remain unchanged through 2023.
The Fed's interest-rate outlook for 2020 through 2023 was 0.1%, unchanged from previous projections in September, the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections showed.
The central bank pledged to maintain its near-zero interest rate range for some time comes as the recovery has slowed recently amid rising infections that have triggered restrictions and exacerbated concerns over the uncertain economic outlook.
Despite the recent slowdown, the Fed has upped its outlook on growth, though reiterated the ongoing pandemic poses ""considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.""  
The economy is expected to contract by 2.4% in 2020, up from an estimate for 3.7% contraction previously. For 2021, the Fed expects the economy to grow by 4.2%, and 3.2% in 2022, up from previous estimates of 4% and 3% respectively.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the first-quarter data will show a significant impact from a surge in the virus, but the economy should perform strongly in the second half of next year, underpinned by a boost from the vaccine rollout. 
The unemployment rate for the year is expected to come in at 6.7%, down from 7.6% previously, and fall further to 5% next year, down from a previous estimate of 5.5%. The unemployment rate was estimated to improve further, and eventually drop to 3.7% in 2023, down from a prior estimate of 4%. 
The pace of inflation, which the fed has earmarked as a key driver of future monetary policy decisions, is forecast to cool to a rate of 1.4% this year, but improve to 1.8% next year, compared with prior estimates of 1.5% and 1.7% respectively. Looking ahead to 2023, inflation is projected to reach 2%, though the Fed has reiterated that it would let inflation run above target for some time.
""[T]he Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent,"" the Fed said.
With rates near the zero bound level, the central bank has relied on its bond-buying purchases to steady the economic fallout, buying  $120 billion bonds on a monthly basis. The bond-buying program has seen the Fed's balance sheet rise above  $7 trillion from about $4 trillion just before the pandemic struck in early March, but the Fed appears in no hurry to curb the pace of purchases.
The current pace of bond buying would continue ""until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said. ""These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.""
Ahead of the FOMC meeting, some had floated the idea of the Fed adopting a Bank of Canada approach - by trimming bond purchases to target longer duration bonds - but Powell said the view among Fed members on the BoC approach was ""mixed""  and wasn't high on the list of possibilities."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. retail sales fell more than expected in November, likely weighed down by raging new COVID-19 infections and decreasing household income, adding to growing signs of a slowdown in the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession.
The second straight monthly decline in retail sales reported by the Commerce Department on Wednesday could nudge Congress to agree on another fiscal stimulus package. Still, economists say more money from the government and the rollout of coronavirus vaccines would probably not stop the economy from sharply slowing down and even contracting in the first quarter of 2021.
News of the weak start to the holiday shopping season came as Federal Reserve officials were wrapping up a two-day policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is expected to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero and deliver a playbook for what might prompt the Fed to pump more money into the economy. 
""The economy is hitting a very rough patch,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Although widespread vaccine distribution will support stronger economic growth by mid-2020, conditions will remain soft until then.""
Retail sales dropped 1.1% last month, with receipts declining almost across the board. Data for October was revised down to show sales slipping 0.1% instead of rising 0.3% as previously reported, adding a sting to the report. 
It was the first back-to-back decline in sales since April, when stringent measures to control the first wave of coronavirus cases crippled the economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would decrease 0.3% in November. Sales increased 4.1% on a year-on-year basis. 
The plunge in sales last month was led by motor vehicles, with receipts at auto dealerships tumbling 1.7% after being unchanged in October. Receipts at clothing stores plummeted 6.8%. Consumers also cut back on eating and drinking out. Sales at restaurants and bars dropped 4.0%.
Sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 3.5% and receipts at furniture stores declined 1.1%. There were also decreases in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. But receipts at food and beverage stores rose, as did those at building material stores. 
Online retail sales rose a modest 0.2%. Some economists said Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s ""Prime Day"" event in October had pulled sales from November. Online retail sales soared 2.4% in October.
""With COVID cases still near peak levels and state and local governments adding further mandates in recent weeks, we expect more weakness from retail sales ahead,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
RECOVERY SLOWING
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales declined 0.5% last month after a downwardly revised 0.1% fall in October. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have edged up 0.1% in October.
The United States is struggling with a fresh COVID-19 outbreak, with the death toll from the disease rising above the 300,000 mark on Monday, according to a Reuters tally of official data. Many state and local governments have imposed new restrictions on businesses, while some consumers are avoiding shopping malls, restaurants and bars.
Restaurants moved outdoors over the summer and the arrival of cold weather is also undercutting spending. A separate report from data firm IHS Markit on Wednesday showed business activity slowed in the first half of December.
The reports added to data this month showing the economy, which plunged into recession in February, added the fewest jobs in six months in November. The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits jumped to near a three-month high in the first week of December. 
The situation has been compounded by the loss of a weekly unemployment supplement. More than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief is almost depleted, and at least 9 million unemployed and underemployed Americans are set to lose government-funded benefits on Dec. 26. 
Lawmakers neared a $900 billion deal for another rescue package on Wednesday. But economists said this was insufficient given the shock caused by the pandemic.
""They are trying to get a modest relief package done to help those in need rather than a trillion-dollar mega-package like in March that turned the recession around quickly with a recovery that was V-shaped for a time,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The outlook now for the economy is grim despite the miracle vaccines that are on the way.""
Health experts have cautioned it could take a while for many Americans to be inoculated. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% annualized rate. 
Most economists expect the economy to contract in the first three months of 2021.

The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the third quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the April-June quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

Business inventories rose 0.7% in October after increasing 0.8% in September, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product. October's rise was in line with economists' expectations. They were down 4.0% on a year-on-year basis in October.
Retail inventories rose 0.9% in October instead of 0.8% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.6% jump in September. Motor vehicle inventories advanced 1.0% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.8% instead of 0.7% as estimated last month.
Gross domestic product rebounded at a historic 33.1% annualized growth rate in the third quarter, thanks to more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers. That followed a 31.4% rate of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.
Inventories added to GDP growth last quarter after being a drag for five straight quarters. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate because of the outbreak in coronavirus infections and the largely expired fiscal stimulus.
Wholesale inventories jumped 1.1% in October. Stocks at manufacturers rebounded 0.2%.

Business sales increased 0.9% in October, matching September's rise. At October's sales pace, it would take 1.31 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.32 months in September.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Wednesday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, fell to a reading of 55.7 early this month from 58.6 in November. A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output.
The United States is struggling with a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 infections, with the death toll from the respiratory illness rising above 300,000 on Monday, according to a Reuters tally of official data. Many jurisdictions have re-imposed limits on businesses, while some consumers are avoiding shopping malls, restaurants and bars, undercutting the services sector. 
According to IHS Markit, though new orders continued to grow, temporary shutdowns and customer uncertainty weighed on the upturn. It also noted that companies reported a fall in new export sales as renewed lockdowns in key export markets dampened foreign demand. 
Supply chain disruptions remained an issue, ""with delays more prevalent than at any time since comparable data were available in 2007,"" the data firm said. 
The moderation in business activity is in line with economists' expectations for a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter after gross domestic product accelerated at historic a 33.1% rate in the third quarter. That followed a 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
Growth forecasts for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate, reflecting the surging virus and the almost depleted rescue package worth more than $3 trillion.
The survey's flash composite new orders index fell to 55.1 this month from a reading of 57.5 in November. Its flash services sector PMI dropped to a reading of 55.3 this month from 58.4 in November. 

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 55.9 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. A measure of new business in the services sector decreased to a reading of 55 from 57.6 in November. The services employment index slipped to a reading of 53.9 from 57.8 in November.
Manufacturing details were mixed. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI dipped to a reading of 56.5 from 56.7 in November. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.3% of the economy, declining to 55.7 in December. 
A measure of new orders received by factories fell to a reading of 55.7 from 57.4 in November. But a gauge of factory employment rose to 52.1 from a reading of 51.7 in November.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the goods trade surplus of the 19 countries sharing the euro with the rest of the world was 30.0 billion euros ($36.6 billion) in October, up from 27.2 billion a year earlier. 
Euro zone imports fell 11.7% in October compared to a year earlier while exports dropped by only 9.0%.
Adjusted for seasonal swings the trade surplus in October was 25.9 billion euros, up from 23.7 billion in September as seasonally adjusted goods exports rose by 2.1% month-on-month and imports by 1.0%.
Eurostat said that, in the last six months, exports recovered more quickly than imports so that the trade balance returned to pre-crisis levels. However, compared to February, the month before COVID-19 restrictions were imposed, exports and imports were down respectively 6.2% and 7.4%.
The European Union's trade deficit with China grew in the January-October period to 151.1 billion euros from 140.9 billion in the same period of 2019, but the deficit in trade with Russia, Europe's main suppliers of oil and gas, fell sharply to 13.0 billion euros from 48.9 billion.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone economic performance far exceeded expectations this month - although it still contracted slightly - as a second wave of coronavirus infections and renewed lockdowns had less of an impact than earlier in the year, a survey showed.
Manufacturers reported strong growth, fuelled by rising exports and a booming performance from Germany, but the services industry remained in decline as social distancing restrictions were kept in place.
IHS Markit's flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, soared to 49.8 in December from November's 45.3, just shy of the 50 mark separating growth from contraction. A Reuters poll had predicted a much shallower rise to 45.8.
""The decent rebound in the composite PMI primarily reflects the partial lifting of restrictions in France and provides some hope that euro zone GDP won't fall quite as much in Q4 as feared,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.

Germany's private sector showed resilience as manufacturing picked up steam and services partly recovered, a sister survey showed, while in France activity unexpectedly returned almost to growth this month as some restrictions were eased.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders have agreed to shut most stores and schools from Wednesday until at least Jan. 10 and although France's lockdown officially ended on Tuesday cafes, restaurants and cultural venues remain closed and some restrictions in place.
Meanwhile in Britain, which has suffered the second highest COVID-19 death toll in Europe, the economy limped back to growth but hospitality businesses struggled and Brexit disruption hit factory supply chains.
Britain faces the added headache that a post-Brexit transition period finishes at the end of the year and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has so far been unable to agree on a future relationship with the European Union.

SHOT IN THE ARM
The PMI covering the bloc's dominant service industry bounced to 47.3 from 41.7, exceeding all expectations in the Reuters poll that had instead predicted a modest increase to 41.9.
With activity still in decline, and restrictions likely to be in place for some time yet, services firms cut headcount again this month, as they have since Europe began to feel the full brunt of the pandemic in March. 
The employment index held below breakeven at 49.4, albeit better than November's 48.2.
Factories have been less affected by lockdown measures as many remained open, and the flash manufacturing PMI jumped to 55.5 from 53.8, its highest since May 2018 and also above all expectations in a Reuters poll with a median prediction of 53.0.
An index measuring output, that feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 56.6 from 55.3.
Strong demand for manufactured goods meant factories built up a solid backlog of work, with the sub-index rising to 56.2 from 54.3, its highest in nearly three years.
And with hopes vaccines being rolled out will allow some return to normality, optimism was at its highest since April 2018. The composite future output index rose to 63.8 from 60.4.
""The recent positive news on the vaccine front have contributed to an improvement in business expectations,"" said Nicola Nobile at Oxford Economics.
""But while we certainly welcome this news, the short term outlook is still clouded with risks, in particular in relation to the extension of the containment measures.""

Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders have agreed to shut most stores and schools from Wednesday until at least Jan. 10 to reverse a tide of COVID-19 infections that lighter restrictions introduced on Nov. 2 have failed to tame.
IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of Europe's largest economy, rose to 52.5 from 51.7 in November.
That beat a Reuters forecast for a decline to 50.4 and was the sixth month in a row that the reading was above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
The flash PMI for activity in the services sector improved to 47.7 in December from 46.0 the previous month. A Reuters poll had predicted a drop to 44.0.
The flash PMI for manufacturing rose to 58.6 from 57.8 in November, beating a forecast for a drop to 56.4. The reading was the highest in nearly three years.
The stronger-than-expected PMI figures suggest the German economy ended the final quarter of the year on a surprisingly solid footing.
Economists have warned that Germany's decision to tighten its second coronavirus lockdown increased the risk of another recession in Europe's largest economy.
IHS Markit's Phil Smith said the survey showed the economy still on a stable platform, at least up until the middle of the month, with the flash data collected from Dec. 4-15.
""However, the impending harder lockdown threatens to put paid to some of the resilience we've seen so far, with more sectors set to be impacted by the new tougher virus containment measures,"" Smith added.

Nonetheless, German manufacturers and their service sector counterparts are positive about the outlook for 2021 in light of the expected rollout of vaccines, he said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index rose to a four-month high of 49.6 from 40.6 in November, beating by a wide margin the 42.9 expected by economists in a Reuters poll. 
The surprise improvement brought the index almost to the 50-point threshold that denotes an expansion in business activity rather than a contraction.
France began lifting some restrictions this month after imposing its second coronavirus lockdown at the end of October to contain a new wave of infections. 
Though cafes, restaurants and cultural venues remain closed and some restrictions remain in place, the new lockdown officially ended on Tuesday.
Under the second round of restrictions, business activity has generally held up much better than during the first, stricter lockdown as companies have adapted to working with sanitary protocols or staff at home.
""With lockdown restrictions having eased this week and a clearer pathway to immunizing the population ahead, firms can now begin working back up towards pre-coronavirus levels of activity,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said. 
""That expansionary mindset was exemplified by the first increase in employment for 10 months and confidence levels reaching their highest since January,"" he added.
A flash PMI index for the service sector jumped to 49.2 from 38.8 in November, far exceeding expectations for a reading of 40.0.

In the manufacturing sector, where restrictions have had less impact on activity, the flash PMI returned to growth with a reading of 51.1, up from 49.6 last month and beating expectations for a reading of 50.1.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 16, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Black Friday sales helped drive down UK inflation in November,"By Andy Bruce and David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation slowed by much more than expected in November, possibly reflecting Black Friday discounts as clothing and footwear prices fell by the most in a decade, official data showed on Wednesday.
Consumer prices rose 0.3% in annual terms, after a 0.7% rise in October, the Office for National Statistics said. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 0.6%. 
With investors eyeing a breakthrough in trade talks between Britain and the European Union before the Brexit transition period expires at the turn of the year, the pound dropped only slightly against the dollar after the data, before rebounding.
The figures leave inflation close to the almost five-year low of 0.2% struck in August and a long way off the Bank of England's 2% target. 
The central bank announces its December interest rate decision on Thursday and is likely to note the weakness of inflation after it had predicted inflation last month would come in around 0.5%. 
""Looking forward, there are signs of inflationary pressures building, such as rising global commodity prices, but there is currently too much slack in the UK economy for it to become an issue,"" said Jon Hudson (NYSE:HUD), UK equity manager at fund management firm Premier Miton Investors.
In November alone, the ONS said clothing and footwear prices slumped by 2.7% - the biggest drop for November on record - compared with a 1.0% increase last year.
Compared with a year earlier, clothing and footwear prices were 3.6% lower, the biggest annual decline since January 2010.
""The price fall in November this year reflects increased discounting and there have been media reports that some Black Friday sales may have spread further across the month,"" the ONS said.

Clothing sales have struggled in Britain since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and several major high street clothing retailers have fallen into financial difficulties, putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is expected to keep monetary policy steady on Friday and hope the extension of an existing fund-aid package will give companies enough time to weather the hit from a recent resurgence in coronavirus infections.
A stable yen, rising stocks and rebounding overseas demand have offered some breathing space for policymakers struggling to underpin a fragile recovery with a dearth of ammunition.
But lingering fears over the pandemic have kept service demand weak. Mounting COVID-19 cases forced the government to suspend a discount programme aimed at propping up spending on travel - but criticized for spreading the virus.
With the outlook highly uncertain, the BOJ is likely to decide on Friday to extend a range of steps aimed at easing corporate funding strains as a precaution against the deepening pain from COVID-19, sources have told Reuters.
The central bank, however, is set to keep its interest rate targets steady at the two-day rate review ending on Friday, and maintain the view the world's third-largest economy will improve moderately as a trend.
""Considering the side effects on financial institutions' profits, we believe that digging further into negative interest rate territory will be avoided"" unless the yen breaches the 100 mark against the dollar, said Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at SuMi TRUST.
The dollar/yen has moved in a tight range recently and stood around 103.50 yen on Wednesday. A move below 100 yen usually triggers verbal warning by Japanese policymakers worried about the impact a strong yen could have on exports.
Under a policy dubbed yield curve control, the BOJ guides short-term rates at -0.1% and 10-year bond yields around zero.
The BOJ also created a package of measures to cushion the blow from COVID-19 in March through May, which included an increase in purchases of corporate debt and a creation of a new lending facility to channel money via banks to cash-strapped firms.
Markets widely expect the BOJ to extend the deadline for the package as the resurgence in infections cloud the outlook.
BOJ officials say expanding the programmes will be the first line of defense against additional strains from the pandemic, though they do not rule out rate cuts as among policy options.
Markets are focusing on how BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda would describe risks to growth from the recent resurgence in infections at his post-meeting briefing.
Japan's economy rebounded in July-September from its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, though the third wave of infections is dampening prospects for a strong recovery.

The government last week announced a fresh $708 billion economic stimulus package to speed up the recovery, bringing the combined value of Japan's pandemic-related spending to about $3 trillion.

(Reuters) - U.S. households across the board built up savings during the pandemic, but low-income households are burning through their cash more quickly than higher-income families and could be out of savings soon if more aid is not delivered, according to a study released on Wednesday. 
By the end of October, the median low-income family spent 64% of the extra cash they accumulated this year compared with last year, leaving them with about $236 in extra cash, according to a report released Wednesday by the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Institute. In contrast, higher-income households lost just 38% of the cash cushion built up this year, and had a median $810 in savings, the study found.
""If these trends continue, we would expect low-income families to deplete their account balance gains sooner than their high-earning counterparts,"" researchers noted in the report.
(GRAPHIC: Cash piles shrinking - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/rlgpdqoabvo/chart.png) 
The JPMorgan Chase study showed that cash balances appeared steady on average after rising earlier this year, in line with a separate report released by the Federal Reserve last week showing that balances in cash, checking accounts and savings deposits rose over the three months ending in September to a record $13.4 trillion.
But a look at cash balances for the median household - which is not affected as much by households with abnormally high, or unusually low, account balances - showed a more volatile experience. 
The median cash balance for checking account holders studied by JPMorgan Chase rose in the spring when the government distributed cash payments to most households - and balances have been declining since. 
Those households could experience another substantial drop in income and spending at the end of the year when unemployment benefits are set to expire for millions of workers participating in pandemic programs created by the CARES Act, the researchers said. 
Consumers have previously cut spending on non-durable goods by 12% after losing unemployment benefits, and those receiving jobless benefits reduced spending by 14% over the summer after a $600 weekly supplement to unemployment benefits expired at the end of July, the study noted.

Lawmakers have yet to reach an agreement on another round of aid. Some COVID-19 relief measures could be attached to a critical spending measure that must be passed by Friday to avoid a federal government shutdown.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 10:50PM ET</span>","Japan posts record run of export declines on soft U.S., China demand","By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports fell in November, dashing expectations for an end to the two-year run of declines, largely due to weaker U.S.- and China-bound shipments and suggesting a slower pace of recovery for the world's third-largest economy.
The trade data is likely to be of some concern for policymakers counting on solid external demand to boost factory output and broader corporate activity to revive the economy. 
""The risk that Japan's economy will stall in the first quarter is gradually becoming stronger,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""It feels like Japan's economic recovery is somewhat behind that in China and the United States and European countries given the exports trend and state of domestic demand.""
Ministry of Finance (MOF) data out on Wednesday showed exports fell 4.2% in November from a year earlier, defying the economists' median estimate of a 0.5% increase in a Reuters poll.
That marked the 24th straight month of decline, the longest stretch on record based on comparable data going back to 1979, and follows a 0.2% drop in the previous month.
Japan's exports have failed to match the strong recoveries seen in major Asian manufacturing rivals China and South Korea, which have benefited from brisk global demand for technology that enables remote working during the pandemic.
In contrast, analysts said Japanese manufacturers face challenges selling high-value capital goods, such as factory machinery, to overseas markets at a time when growing demand for consumer goods is driving the recovery in many of those economies.
""Goods used in companies' capital spending are seeing the biggest delay, even as cars are being sold well and the rebound in semiconductors has been quite strong,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Economic Research Institute.
Takeda added that a long stretch of import declines, which fell for their 19th straight month in November, pointed to persistent weakness in domestic demand, highlighting Japan's relatively slow economic recovery.
By destination, shipments to the United States contracted for the first time in three months, falling 2.5% in November versus the same month a year earlier, as weak demand for aircraft equipment helped offset higher car exports.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose at the slowest pace in five months, growing 3.8%, driven by communication devices.
Shipments to Asia fell for the first time in two months, decreasing 4.3%, while those to the European Union dropped 2.6% in November.
Imports shed 11.1% in November compared with the same month a year earlier, versus the median estimate for a 10.5% decrease. Japan's trade surplus narrowed to 366.8 billion yen ($3.54 billion), versus the median estimate for a 529.8 billion yen surplus.
Japan's cabinet on Tuesday approved a third supplementary budget to fund a fresh $708 billion stimulus package, which includes about 40 trillion yen in direct fiscal spending and focuses on investment in new growth areas such as green and digital innovation.
Data last week confirmed the economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter from its biggest postwar slump in April-June. A private-sector survey showed on Wednesday Japan's factory activity came within striking distance of stabilisation in December, adding to signs that the economy is on the mend.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Nine months into the COVID-19 pandemic, women of color in Canada still face far higher unemployment than white women, official data shows, in part because they tend to work jobs in hard-hit sectors and often care for children or relatives.
The unemployment rate for minority women was 10.5% in November, compared with 6.2% for white women, according to Statistics Canada data provided to Reuters. Women of color also had a slightly higher unemployment rate than their male counterparts, who had a jobless rate of 10.0%.
Canada has recouped more than 80% of the jobs lost at the height of the COVID-19 crisis, but many minority women have not returned to work.
""What we're seeing ... is the unequal impact of this pandemic on diverse groups of Canadians,"" said Lynn Barr-Telford, an assistant chief statistician at Statscan, in an interview before the latest data was released.
""These inequities pre-date COVID... but they've been further exasperated by COVID,"" Barr-Telford said. 
Statscan added a question on race to its monthly job survey in July. The first survey found South Asian women had among the highest unemployment rates in Canada at 20.4% and Black women at 18.6%.
Four months later, the unemployment rate for Black women remains one of the highest at 13.4%.
Chinese Canadian women, meanwhile, are the furthest from their pre-pandemic employment levels with a jobless rate of 10.2% in November. 
Indigenous Canadians also face disproportionate negative impacts on employment from the pandemic, with the unemployment rate for Indigenous women averaging 16.8% from June to August, Statscan said in a separate report released in November. 
""We have diversity within diversity, of course. So not all groups are experiencing the labor market shutdown the same,"" said Barr-Telford.
GRAPHIC: Unemployment rates for Canadian women by race - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/EMPLOYMENT/gjnpwkaxkpw/chart.png 
SYSTEMATIC DISADVANTAGES
White women have fared better as ""they tend to be in better paid jobs that are less precarious and they have more resources at their disposal,"" said Wendy Cukier, founder of the Diversity Institute at the Ted Rogers (NYSE:ROG) School of Management.
Women of color, meanwhile, face systematic disadvantages from fewer opportunities for career advancement to less access to basic services like high-speed internet and flexible daycare.
Childcare is one of the issues that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has promised to tackle as part of a major stimulus package pledged to come in next spring's budget.
But with women in racial minorities bearing the brunt of the pandemic slump, more needs to be done to ensure that stimulus is tailored to their needs, with a focus on career and entrepreneurial supports, say advocates.

""We have an opportunity to really rethink what we value,"" said Cukier.

The euro zone's second-biggest economy is set to grow 3% in the first quarter from the current quarter, when it is expected to contract by 4%, INSEE said in its latest economic outlook.
The quarterly growth rate will then moderate slightly to 2% in the second quarter, leaving the economy 3% smaller than it was before the crisis by mid-2021.
The French economy has slumped again this quarter after the government imposed a second lockdown from late October to contain a second wave of infections that has since eased.

As a result, INSEE estimated the French economy will contract by 9% in 2020 overall, in line with forecasts by other institutions but less than the 11% expected by the government.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output increased more than expected in November, boosted by motor vehicle production, though momentum could slow as a fresh outbreak of COVID-19 infections keeps workers at home and temporarily shuts down factories.
Other data on Tuesday suggested that a benign inflation environment could persist for a while, with import prices barely rising last month even as the dollar has weakened against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners. 
Strong production at factories is defying signs of a slowdown in the economy's recovery from the coronavirus recession, underscored by rising layoffs. Retail sales likely declined in November for the first time since April, according to a Reuters survey of economists. November's retail sales report is scheduled to be released on Wednesday.
""COVID-19 containment measures are likely to exert a heavy economic toll over the next few months and the manufacturing sector won't be immune, but it is going to be far less directly impacted than consumer services in big cities,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
Manufacturing output rose 0.8% last month after surging 1.1% in October, the Federal Reserve said. Factory production remains 3.8% below its pre-pandemic level. Economists had forecast manufacturing output rising 0.3% in November.
Motor vehicle production rebounded 5.3% after declining for three straight months. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing output increased 0.4% after surging 1.3% in October. 
A shift in demand from services to goods during the pandemic is underpinning manufacturing's recovery. But the relentless crisis also poses a risk. The Institute for Supply Management early this month reported a dip in business sentiment in November, with manufacturers saying the resurgence in coronavirus infections was straining suppliers and that production lines were being shut down due to lack of staff. 
The ISM warned that absenteeism at factories and their suppliers as well as difficulties in returning and hiring workers would continue to ""dampen"" manufacturing until the pandemic ended.
Fed officials were due to start a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Policymakers are expected to keep interest rates near zero and deliver a playbook for what might prompt them to pump more money into the economy.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
BROAD INCREASE 
A separate report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showed its measure of manufacturing conditions in New York state fell to a reading of 4.9 in December from 6.3 in November. 
But manufacturers were optimistic about conditions over the next six months, likely reflecting the arrival of a vaccine for the virus, which has killed more than 300,000 people in the United States. 
""Production will be soft in the near term as record-high COVID-19 cases and a lack of fiscal stimulus weigh on the U.S. economy early next year,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""But activity should pick up by mid-2021 as vaccine distribution leads to stronger overall economic growth.""
(Graphic: Atlantic business activity - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xlbvgmllevq/empirestate.png)
The increase in manufacturing output was broad last month, with big gains in the production of primary metals, computers and electronics, aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment. But production of consumer goods and business supplies dropped.
Manufacturing combined with a rise in mining output to lift industrial production 0.4% in November. Industrial output increased 0.9% in October. Production at mines rebounded 2.3% after declining 0.7% in October. Oil and gas well drilling increased 8.3%, rising for a third straight month.
Utilities output fell 4.3% as warmer-than-usual temperatures cut demand for heating. Utilities advanced 1.8% in October. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, rose 0.6 percentage point to 72.6% in November. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector increased to 73.3% from 73% in October. It is 6.5 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy - how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
Muted inflation was underscored by a separate report from the Labor Department on Tuesday showing import prices edged up 0.1% last month after dipping 0.1% in October.
Import prices, which exclude tariffs, decreased 1.0% in the 12 months through November after falling by the same margin in October. Year-on-year import prices have declined for 10 straight months. 
Petroleum prices rose 2.1%. Excluding petroleum, import prices were flat after dipping 0.1% in October. 
Import prices have remained weak even as the dollar has depreciated about 7.4% versus the currencies of the United States' main trade partners since April.

Government data last week showed marginal increases in consumer and producer prices in November. Though the pandemic has boosted prices of some goods because of supply and production constraints, it has weighed on services, leading to overall benign inflation.

""Import prices look set to continue as a restraint on broader price pressures, giving additional support for the Fed's dovish bias,"" said James Watson, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's jobless rate rose again in the three months to October and redundancies reached a record high as companies were hit by new coronavirus restrictions and prepared for the end of government job subsidies that were eventually extended into 2021.
Official data showed the unemployment rate reached 4.9%, up from 4.8% in the three months to September, its highest in more than four years.
However, the increase was smaller than expected by most economists. A Reuters poll had forecast a jump to 5.1%.
The number of redundancies reached a record high of 370,000 in the August-to-October period, although it decreased in October alone, the Office for National Statistics said.
""Overall we have seen a continuation of recent trends, with a further weakening in the labour market,"" said Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics. 
For much of the period covered by Tuesday's data, finance minister Rishi Sunak rejected calls to extend his broad job- retention scheme beyond a scheduled Oct. 31 expiry, raising fears of an acceleration in job losses.
But, as a second wave COVID-19 cases hit, Sunak was forced to extend the scheme until the end of March 2021.
""The ... extension of furloughing will provide a lifeline for many jobs over the difficult winter months, but the big question is what happens after,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors.
The introduction of vaccines offered some hope, but hiring plans remained stuck in neutral, he said, calling for new measures to help job creation, such as a social security contributions cut.
The Bank of England has forecast that the unemployment rate is likely to peak at nearly 8% in the second quarter of 2021.
The Arcadia fashion group fell into administration late in November putting more than 13,000 jobs at risk, and retail chain Debenhams is closing all its shops, jeopardising 12,000 jobs.
As well as COVID-19, Britain's economy faces the risk of a shock from the end of its post-Brexit transition period on Dec. 31. London and Brussels remain locked in negotiations little more than two weeks before the possible introduction of tariffs and other barriers to trade with the European Union.
Tax office data showed the number of staff on company payrolls slipped by a monthly 28,000 in November, taking the total number of job losses since February, according to the payrolls measure, to 819,000, a third of them in hospitality. 

Job vacancies rose to 547,000 in the three months to November, about 60% higher than during the depths of the pandemic slump but down by about a third from a year earlier.

Investing.com – Chinese industrial output expanded for an eighth straight month in November, with economic recovery in the world’s second largest economy gathering pace as global demand increased.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) earlier in the day showed that industrial production grew 7% year-on-year, against the 7% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and slightly higher than October’s 6.9% growth. Retail sales grew 5% year-on-year, down from the forecast 5.2% growth but up from October’s 4.3% growth.
The unemployment rate was 5.2%, in line with forecasts but slightly down from October’s 5.3% rate.
Strong exports have been a key driver for the economy’s recovery from COVID-19-induced lockdowns in the first quarter of the year. Demand for medical equipment and work-from-home electronic devices have also boosted exports in recent months as many of China’s biggest markets tightened restrictive measures to curb increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases.
Some investors remained positive about the economic recovery.
The data points to fourth quarter growth that’s likely to be better than the previous three months, NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said after the data’s release. The retail recovery is on track and consumption will remain the main growth engine, he said, while also projecting “relatively fast” expansion in 2021.
The improvement in industrial production was “underpinned by robust domestic demand and very strong export … we expect the macro policy stance to shift from expansionary to contractionary, with the overall government deficit declining and monetary policy makers aiming to contain macro leverage,” Oxford Economics’ Louis Kuijs told Bloomberg.
Single’s Day events put on by e-commerce companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) in November also saw strong consumer sentiment and further boosted orders for small factories.
The accelerated recovery seen so far in the fourth quarter looks set to continue into 2021, aided by stronger demand, credit growth and stimulus measures.
However, the tighter restrictions implemented in some of China’s trading partners could create shipping bottle necks, in turn increasing transportation costs and capping the speed of China’s recovery."

BEIJING (Reuters) -China's factory output grew at the fastest pace in 20 months in November, as revived consumer spending and a gradual easing of COVID-19 restrictions in major trading partners lifted demand for the country's manufactured goods.
Industrial output growth quickened to 7.0% in November from a year earlier, data from the National Statistics Bureau (NBS) showed on Tuesday. That was in line with analyst expectations in a Reuters poll and faster than the 6.9% expansion in October.
China's economy has staged an impressive recovery from its COVID-19 paralysis earlier this year, mainly driven by robust exports that have fired up the nation's factories again.
An annual sales promotion extravaganza in November by China's e-commerce giants has also open consumers' wallets in a further boost to orders for small factories.
""China's economy continued to accelerate across all fronts in November. We expect output to remain above-trend in the coming quarters, even as tailwinds from stimulus and exports start to ease,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, of Capital Economics, in a note.
Retail sales rose 5% on-year, just missing analysts' forecast for 5.2% growth but faster than the 4.3% increase in October.
Auto sales saw 11.8% growth and sales of household appliances grew 5.1% in November. Communications equipment sales jumped 43.6%.
Fixed-asset investment rose 2.6% in January-November from the same period last year, faster than a 1.8% increase in the first 10 months of 2020.
Private sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for 60% of total investment, rose 0.2% in January-November, compared with a 0.7% decline in the first 10 months of the year.
China's economic recovery looks to be accelerating in the fourth quarter, driven by stronger demand, credit growth and stimulus measures expected to provide a strong tailwind into 2021.
Industrial demand surged in November with non-ferrous output hitting a monthly record, as the country kept churning out metals used in manufacturing and construction.
NBS spokesman Fu Linghui said at a news conference in Beijing he expects growth in 2021 to be ""relatively fast,"" although that would be due to a low base this year, rather than any significant changes in the economy.
China could make some policy adjustments as the economy improves, he said.
""We expect 7% GDP growth in 2021 from 1.7% in 2020,"" said Iris Pang, ING's Chief Economist for Greater China, by email.
Factory activity growth hit a more than three-year high in November, an official survey showed earlier this month, as fewer COVID-19 infections boosted consumer confidence.
Exports also surged at their fastest pace in almost three years thanks to demand for personal protective equipment and electronics products for working from home.

More recently, however, tougher measures to contain the coronavirus imposed by the country's trading partners have created shipping bottle necks, pushing up transportation costs and capping the speed of China's recovery.

1068,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","U.S. consumers uncertain about labor market, finances -New York Fed survey","(Reuters) - Americans remained uncertain in November over how they might fare financially as the U.S. economy heals from the coronavirus crisis, with consumers reporting mixed views on the labor market, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve. 
Expectations for earnings growth over the next year remained flat at 2% for the fifth straight month. But respondents' views on how spending might change over the next year ""rebounded sharply"" to a median 3.7%, the New York Fed said. 
However, consumers remained worried about the labor market, and more people are expecting declines in home prices and the stock market, the survey showed. 
The U.S. economy added 245,000 jobs in November, the fewest in six months. Growth was hindered by a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases that, together with a lack of more government relief money, threatens to reverse the recovery from the pandemic recession.
Fed officials will need to factor in the impact of expiring stimulus against the benefits of upcoming vaccines when they meet this week to set monetary policy and issue economic projections.
Consumers polled by the New York Fed said there was a 40.1% chance, on average, that the unemployment rate will be higher a year from now - the first increase since July. 
The average perceived odds that U.S. stock prices will be higher one year from now dropped by 2.3 percentage points to 38.5% in November, the lowest since August 2019. And expectations for how home prices will change over one year also dropped in November - the first decline since April. 
Median inflation expectations over the next year increased by 0.2 percentage point in November to 3.0% and rose by 0.1 percentage point to 2.8% for the next three years. 

The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll conducted on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese business sentiment improved at the fastest pace in nearly two decades in October-December, a key central bank survey showed, a welcome sign for the economy as it emerges from the initial hit of the coronavirus pandemic.
But companies slashed their capital expenditure plans for the year ending March 2021 and a measure of near-term sentiment worsened, as a resurgence of infections reinforces expectations any recovery in the world's third-largest economy will be fragile.
""A stronger-than-expected rebound in factory output mid-year and a recovery in overseas economies, notably China, helped improve manufacturers' sentiment,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
""But companies likely won't raise capital expenditure much next fiscal year given the renewed rise in COVID-19 cases.""
While Japan avoided the high case numbers seen elsewhere when the coronavirus first hit, infections have risen as winter sets in, hitting a daily record on Saturday.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment improved to minus 10 in December from minus 27 in September, the Bank of Japan's ""tankan"" survey showed on Monday, still a negative reading but marking the second straight quarter when companies were less pessimistic about business conditions.
It was better than the minus 15 projected in a Reuters poll and the fastest pace of improvement since 2002, as Japanese car and auto parts makers benefitted from a global rebound in automobile demand, the survey showed.
The tankan indexes are calculated by subtracting the percentage of pessimistic respondents from optimistic ones. A negative figure means pessimists outnumber optimists.
Big non-manufacturers' sentiment also improved to minus 5 from minus 12 in September, roughly matching a Reuters poll of minus 6 and improving at the fastest pace since 2010.
A government campaign offering discounts for domestic travel helped lift sentiment among industries ranging from hotels, restaurants and retailers, a BOJ official told a briefing.
But big firms plan to cut capital expenditure by 1.2% in the current business year to March 2021, bigger than market forecasts for a 0.2% drop, the survey showed.
This was a downgrade from September when they planned to raise expenditure by 1.4%, a sign that slumping profits and the pandemic's resurgence are making firms wary of boosting spending.
Companies expect recurring profits to fall 35.3% this fiscal year as sales are seen slumping 8.6%, the tankan showed.
An index gauging firms' sentiment three months ahead worsened, suggesting that many of them feel conditions won't improve much despite recent progress in vacinne development.
Companies also plan to slash new graduate hiring by 6.1% in the year beginning in April, the survey showed, which would be the most cautious hiring plan since the collapse of Lehman Brothers shook the global economy in 2010.
""Uncertainty over the outlook is weighing on companies' sentiment,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute. ""Unless people feel safe about going out, it would be difficult for government stimulus measures to yield results.""
The data will be among key factors the BOJ will scrutinise at its two-day rate review ending on Friday. The central bank is set to hold off on expanding stimulus, but consider extending a range of steps aimed at easing funding strains.
The government, for its part, announced a fresh $708 billion stimulus package last week to speed up the recovery from the coronavirus-driven slump.

After suffering its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter, Japan's economy rebounded in July-September helped by improved exports and consumption. But many analysts expect a third wave of COVID-19 infections to keep any recovery modest.

Average new home prices in 70 major cities rose 0.1% in November from the previous month, the slowest pace since March when the market was battered by coronavirus-induced lockdown measures, Reuters calculated from National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data. That compared with 0.2% on-month growth in October.
Prices rose 4.0% in November from the same month a year earlier, the weakest rate since February 2016. That compared with a 4.3% on-year increase in October.
China's property market has recovered quickly from the COVID-19 pandemic, with home sales and investment growing at a robust pace, prompting the government to step up efforts to deleverage the highly indebted sector to curb financial risk.
However, price rises are uneven and concentrated in clusters in the southern Pearl River Delta and eastern Yangtze River Delta. In the north, some cities have seen demand slump after an initial spurt.
The NBS data also showed the number of cities reporting monthly price increases for new homes fell to 36 out of 70 from 45 in October.

China's banking regulator recently highlighted the property sector as a significant risk to financial stability, calling it the biggest ""grey rhino"" - an obvious yet ignored threat.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's manufacturing industry warned of a potential 'knockout blow' if Prime Minister Boris Johnson is unable to secure a trade deal with the European Union before temporary transition arrangements end on Dec. 31.
Make UK, the trade body for British manufacturers, said it was slashing its growth forecast for the sector in 2021 to 2.7% from 5.1% just three months ago - roughly half the rate of growth it sees for the broader economy.
""Combined with the pandemic, many in industry are feeling like an exhausted boxer in the final round of a bout, with a 'no deal' exit from the EU potentially landing a knockout blow,"" Make UK's chief executive Stephen Phipson said.
Official data last week showed that British factory output in October was 7.1% below its level a year earlier.
British manufacturers will face tariffs on many of their exports to Europe from Jan. 1 without a trade deal, as well as regulatory hurdles.
Imports have already been disrupted due to high volumes of traffic at ports, linked to COVID and Brexit-related stockpiling, prompting carmaker Honda to suspend operations temporarily last week due to parts shortages.
Make UK said its members expected output to stagnate or fall slightly over the coming quarter - better than the record drops seen in previous quarters due to the pandemic, but overall an anaemic picture.

""It is going to be a long haul back, with talk of a 'V'-shaped recovery nothing more than fanciful,"" Phipson said.

1073,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",U.S. producer prices rise moderately; COVID-19 seen taming inflation,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices barely rose in November, supporting views that inflation would remain benign in the near term as a flare-up in new COVID-19 infections restrains the labor market and demand for services.
While other data on Friday showed a surprise improvement in consumer sentiment early in December, that largely reflected increased optimism among Democrats and Independents following Joe Biden's electoral victory over President Donald Trump. 
That is unlikely to translate into robust consumer spending, given business restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak and the accompanying job losses. Millions of unemployed Americans are set to lose their government-funded benefits on Dec. 26, with Congress struggling to agree on another pandemic relief package.
""We saw a similar partisan boost to confidence following the 2016 election which was not followed by a spike in consumption, so we doubt this apparent rise in confidence signals a jump in spending either,"" said Michael Pearce, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in New York.
The producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1% last month after increasing 0.3% in October, the Labor Department said. That was the smallest gain since April. 
In the 12 months through November, the PPI advanced 0.8% after increasing 0.5% in October.
A 0.4% increase in the price of goods accounted for the rise in the PPI. Goods increased 0.5% in October. Services were unchanged after rising 0.2% in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI gaining 0.2% in November and rising 0.8% on a year-on-year basis.
The United States is in the midst of a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, pushing the number of confirmed cases to more than 15 million and deaths to over 289,740 since the pandemic started. New strict stay-at-home orders went into effect in California this week. Other states and local governments have also imposed restrictions on businesses.
Applications for unemployment benefits jumped to their highest level in nearly three months last week.
While the coronavirus pandemic has raised prices of some goods because of supply constraints, it has hurt demand for services like travel and dining out, keeping inflation in check. Millions of people are either underemployed or out of work, limiting wage inflation.
In a separate report on Friday, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index increased to 81.4 early this month from a final reading of 76.9 in November. Sentiment remains well below its pre-pandemic level. Economists had forecast the index steady at 76.5. 
Graphic: Consumer sentiment - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwkwmgpw/umich.png
Sentiment improved among Democrats and Independents, but fell among Republicans. Consumers expected inflation to moderate significantly in the year ahead. Inflation expectations over the next five years were steady.
""The trend in inflation in the near term is likely to be subdued given ample excess capacity and renewed pressure on demand from new restrictions to contain a resurgence of Covid-19 outbreaks,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist
at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
BELOW TARGET
Other details of the PPI report were also softer. Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices inched up 0.1%. The so-called core PPI climbed 0.2% in October. In the 12 months through November, the core PPI gained 0.9% after rising 0.8% in October.
Inflation is running below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average. The government reported on Thursday that consumer prices increased 0.2% in November. 
""There are no factory inflation pressures building, either due to shortages or to stronger manufacturing demand, that could possibly lead to more inflation at the consumer level,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Despite the soft inflation backdrop, economists do not anticipate a deflation, a decline in the general price level that is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
Graphic: PPI - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/jznvnqzrwpl/inflation.png
Wholesale food prices rose 0.5% in November after accelerating 2.4% in October. The cost of residential electricity, natural gas and tobacco products increased. But gasoline prices tumbled 1.9%. There were also decreases in the cost of pharmaceutical preparations.
Core goods prices rose 0.2% after being unchanged in October. Margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, fell 0.3%, helping to restrain services.
Healthcare costs rose 0.2%, while portfolio fees were unchanged. That followed October's 0.5% increase. Airline tickets decreased 7.1% after increasing 1.2% in October.
Those airline tickets, healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure.

With the relevant CPI and PPI components in hand, economists are predicting the core PCE price index rose 1.3% in November. The core PCE price index increased 1.4% in the 12 months through October. November's core PCE price index data is scheduled to be released later this month.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",BOJ tankan to show firms' gloom eased in December: Reuters poll,"By Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's big manufacturers became less gloomy in the December quarter compared with the previous three months as a recovery in exports boosted business confidence in the world's third largest economy, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
The Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is expected to show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence stood at minus 15 in December from minus 27 in September, the poll of 18 economists showed.
That would mark the index's second quarterly rise after hitting an 11-year low in the June quarter when the coronavirus-hit economy suffered its biggest slump on record. 
The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers is also expected to have improved to minus 6 in the three months to December from minus 12 in the previous quarter, the poll showed.
""Exports to China and the United States are recovering, which supported manufacturers' sentiment,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But rising coronavirus cases have increased caution, which may have weighed on the recovery pace of business sentiment.""
Big manufacturers' business confidence will likely pick up to minus 11 in the coming quarter, the poll found. 
Meanwhile, non-manufacturers' business sentiment is expected to worsen to minus 7 as the services sector continues to be hit by people's reluctance to go out for fear of catching the coronavirus.
Economists expected big companies to cut a capital spending plan by 0.1% for this fiscal year to March 2021 in the survey, having forecast a 1.4% rise in the September survey.
Trade data on Wednesday is expected to show a 0.5% increase in exports in November from a year earlier, the first rise since November 2018, and a 10.5% year-on-year fall in imports last month.
The trade surplus was expected to narrow to 529.8 billion yen ($5.09 billion) as a result from a revised 871.7 billion in October, the poll showed.
Inflation data on Friday would likely show the core consumer prices index saw its biggest year-on-year fall in over a decade in November, weighed down by weak energy prices and a government campaign to boost domestic travel with discounts.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, likely fell 0.9% in November from a year earlier, according to the Reuters poll.
The Bank of Japan meanwhile was expected to keep its policy interest rate at minus 0.1% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% when it holds a policy meeting on Dec. 17-18, the poll showed.

1075,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 02:56PM ET</span>",Spiraling COVID-19 cases driving up U.S. layoffs; inflation still benign,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits jumped to a near three-month high last week as mounting new COVID-19 infections led to more business restrictions, further evidence that the pandemic and lack of additional fiscal stimulus were hurting the economy.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, followed in the wake of data last week showing job gains in November were the smallest since the recovery started in May. Labor market distress is eroding demand, keeping inflation tame.
""Mass unemployment continues to weigh on economic growth and demand,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""If Congress continues to sit on its hands without voting on a new relief package, the plight of the nation's unemployed is going to grow darker by the hour.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits surged 137,000 to seasonally adjusted 853,000 for the week ended Dec. 5, the highest since mid-September. The weekly increase was the largest since March, when the nation was battered by the first wave of coronavirus infections. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 725,000 applications in the latest week. 
Unadjusted claims vaulted 228,982 to 947,504 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.4 million people filed claims last week.
Jobless claims hit a record 6.867 million in March. They are above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
The United States is in the throes of a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, with more than 15 million confirmed cases. Daily COVID-19 deaths reached 3,253 on Wednesday, boosting the U.S. total since the start of the pandemic to 289,740, with a record 106,219 people hospitalized.
New strict stay-at-home orders went into effect in California this week, affecting about three-quarters of the nearly 40 million people in the nation's most populous state. 
Other states and local governments have also imposed restrictions on businesses, which economists expect to lead to layoffs during winter, especially without additional pandemic relief money from the government. 
A deal on another package remains elusive amid proposals and counterproposals. More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief has helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls. The fiscal stimulus has almost dried up.
U.S. stocks were mixed. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
DECLINE IN PAYROLLS?
While some of last week's jump in jobless claims likely reflected the usual noise after last month's Thanksgiving holiday, the increase was broadly in line with other labor market data that have suggested the recovery was ebbing after a burst of hiring during summer. 
With COVID-19 infections raging, economists expect a decline in employment over winter, noting it would take a while to distribute vaccines. Independent data showed consumers are hunkering down at home. 
""We need to be braced for a window of perhaps three or four months where restrictions will weigh on economic activity,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""We see a growing probability that employment declines in coming months and not just in those sectors focusing on consumer service who are most likely to experience direct restrictions.""
The claims report also showed that people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 230,000 to 5.757 million in the week ended Nov. 28. That was the first rise since August. The so-called continuing claims had declined, in part as people exhausted their eligibility for benefits, limited to 26 weeks in most states. 
At least 4.533 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended Nov. 21. These benefits, which are funded by the government, are set to expire on Dec. 26 without a new package. About 19 million people were receiving benefits under all programs during that period. Long-term unemployment is becoming acute. Only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its consumer price index rose 0.2% in November after being unchanged in October. But the trend remained soft. In the 12 months through November, the CPI increased 1.2% after a similar gain in October. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI also climbed 0.2% after being flat in October. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, was unchanged after rising 0.2%. Rent inflation has been tamed by forbearance agreements between tenants and landlords and a government moratorium on evictions. 
In the 12 months through November, the so-called core CPI advanced 1.6%, matching October's increase. Inflation is running below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, a flexible average. 

""Inflation will remain low in the near term ... there are still huge swathes of excess capacity in many parts of the economy,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""With unemployment elevated, wage pressures are limited.""

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>",U.S. November budget deficit held to $145 billion by benefit calendar shifts -Treasury,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government posted a $145 billion budget deficit for November, down from $209 billion a year ago, the Treasury Department said on Thursday, but the decline was largely due to calendar shifts of federal benefit payments.
Without these adjustments, Treasury said November receipts would have fallen 6% from November 2019, while outlays would have increased 11%, which would have led to a $207 billion November deficit.
Some $62 billion worth of November benefit payments were shifted into October because November started on a weekend, while the November 2019 data showed $48 billion in December 2019 benefits were paid in November because December started on a weekend.
November receipts as reported totaled $220 billion versus $225 billion a year earlier, a decline of 3%, while November outlays as reported totaled $365 billion, compared to $434 billion a year earlier, a 16% drop.
For the first two months of the 2021 fiscal year started Oct. 1, Treasury reported a federal deficit of $429 billion, compared with $343 billion for the first two months of fiscal 2020.
Treasury officials said this was driven by a 9% increase in outlays to $887 billion due to spending on healthcare and coronavirus rescue programs and on unemployment compensation. Receipts for the year-to-date fell 3% to $457 billion.

The latest Treasury results follow a record full-year deficit of $3.132 trillion for fiscal 2020, which ended Sept. 30, more than tripling the previous year's shortfall due to COVID-19 aid spending.

1077,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 08:39AM ET</span>",U.S. Jobless Claims Leap to Highest Since September as Covid-19 Wave Bites,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The number of people making initial claims for jobless benefits in the U.S. surged to their highest in nearly three months as the latest wave of the Covid-19 pandemic took an increasingly visible toll on the labor market.
The Labor Department said that 853,000 people filed initial jobless claims last week, up from 716,000 a week earlier. Analysts had expected a much smaller rise to only 725,000.
The number of people making continuing claims also rose for the first time since September, to 5.757 million from 5.527 million a week earlier. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.
The numbers come at a time when the coronavirus is running largely out of control in the U.S., with sharp rises in the numbers of deaths and hospital admissions in recent weeks. The U.S. registered over 3,000 deaths from the disease for the first time on Wednesday. Although fatalities are concentrated largely in among (non-working) seniors, more and more parts of the economy are being shut down to protect them and the healthcare system treating them.
The data were released at the same time as other figures showing a slightly larger-than-expected increase in consumer prices in November. Prices rose 0.2% on the month rather than the 0.1% expected, although the annual rate of inflation remained at 1.6%.
Analysts argue that official data are currently understating actual price developments, as prices for food and other high-frequency services are increasing faster, while prices are falling fastest for discretionary services, which are being used less frequently. The rate of rent inflation also continued to fall. 
Reflation ""can only come on the back of a strong economy with rising purchasing power,"" said Julia Coronado, founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Federal Reserve economist, via Twitter. ""Initial claims point to more pain on that front."""

1079,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",UK GDP growth slows to six-month low as COVID hits hospitality,"By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery almost ground to a halt in October as a surge in coronavirus cases hammered the hospitality sector, adding to the chances that the economy will shrink over the final three months of 2020.
Thursday's official data showed the economy lost momentum as public authorities in much of the United Kingdom barred people from socialising in pubs and restaurants, ahead of a broader four-week partial lockdown across England in November.
Gross domestic product rose 0.4% in October after expanding 1.1% in September, the Office for National Statistics said, the weakest growth since output collapsed in April during the first lockdown.
A limited rollout of a COVID vaccine began this week in Britain, offering hope for a rebound in consumer spending in 2021. But many businesses will face new headwinds from trade restrictions with the European Union that come into force on Jan. 1 when post-Brexit transition arrangements end.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the EU's chief executive, Ursula von der Leyen, have given themselves until Sunday to seal a new trade pact that would limit some of the damage, after failing to overcome persistent rifts at a meeting on Wednesday. 
""The economy continued to grow in October, but at a snail's pace. And with the COVID-19 restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, the economy is in for a difficult few months yet,"" Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics said. 
Britain has Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19, with more than 62,000 fatalities, and also suffered the biggest economic hit of any major economy after GDP shrank by an unprecedented 19.8% in the second quarter of this year.
Output in October was 7.9% lower than it was in February, before the pandemic struck Britain's economy, and 8.2% weaker than in October 2019, the ONS said.
Government forecasters do not expect the economy to regain its pre-COVID size until the end of 2022 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted Britain's recovery would be weaker than anywhere bar Argentina.
Although the economy picked up rapidly after the initial shock of the lockdown, it lost momentum as COVID cases started to rise again in September and accelerated in October.
Government restrictions that largely barred Britons from socialising with people they did not live with led to a 14.4% fall in output across the accommodation and restaurant sector.
Most economists think GDP fell outright in November, when the British government imposed a four-week partial lockdown in England, closing non-essential shops and hospitality venues, and similar measures were imposed elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
The decline is expected to be more limited than in the first lockdown, when restrictions were tighter and businesses had less time to adapt.

Economists at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) forecast a 3% fall in GDP for the fourth quarter, and said they expected the Bank of England to cut rates to zero from their current 0.1% - possibly as soon as next week, if Brexit trade talks collapsed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. job openings increased in October, but many of the help wanted signs could disappear amid widespread restrictions on businesses to slow rapidly spreading new COVID-19 infections.
The month-old Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report from the Labor Department on Wednesday also showed a rise in layoffs, though a chunk reflected the discharge of temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census. 
The United States is in the throes of a new wave of coronavirus infections, with the number of confirmed cases crossing the 15 million mark on Tuesday.
""The labor market remains miles and miles away from the best economy in 50 years in February before the pandemic struck,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
""October job openings are likely to disappear in a hurry relatively speaking by the end of the year with new strict stay-at-home orders issued in California this month, which is the most populous state in the country."" 
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased 158,000 to 6.65 million on the last day of October. Vacancies are below their 7 million level in February. There were increases in job openings in the healthcare and social assistance industry. 
State and local government education saw a 23,000 increase in vacancies in October. Surprisingly, local government education has shed jobs in September, October and November. There were education job losses at state governments in September and October.
The overall job openings rate edged up to 4.5% from 4.4% in September. Hiring dipped to 5.81 million in October from 5.89 million in the prior month. That lowered the hiring rate to 4.1% from 4.2% in September. 
Layoffs increased 243,000 to 1.7 million. That included 91,000 layoffs in the federal government, largely due to the departure of the temporary Census workers. The layoffs rate rose to 1.2% from 1.0% in September. 
U.S. financial markets were unmoved by the data.
STEADYING OUT 
""The JOLTS data are consistent with many other labor market indicators that point to steadying out in the job market lately following a period of very strong hiring,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. 
The JOLTS report followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy created 245,000 jobs in November, the smallest gain in nonfarm payrolls since the jobs recovery started in May and the fifth straight monthly slowdown in employment growth. The economy has recouped only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April.
Apart from the business restrictions to curb the out-of- control coronavirus infections, the labor market has lost momentum as more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief has almost dried up. 
The stimulus package helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed wholesale inventories surged 1.1% in October, revised up from the 0.9% as estimated last month. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product jumped 1.3% in October.
Congress is negotiating another relief package. Even with a vaccine on the way, economists are warning of a slow and painful recovery for the labor market and the broader economy. 
""Vaccines are on the way but it is important that Congress takes action to support the unemployed and small businesses during the period before sectors that cannot operate in a socially distanced manner can reopen,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York. 
There were 1.6 unemployed workers for every vacancy in October. 

""Another way to think about this, for every 16 workers who were officially counted as unemployed, there were only available jobs for 10 of them,"" said Elise Gould, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ""That means there were no jobs for 4.2 million unemployed workers. And this misses the fact that many more  weren't counted among the unemployed.""

The Commerce Department said Wednesday wholesale inventories surged 1.1% in October, instead of rising 0.9% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers rose 0.9% in September. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product jumped 1.3% in October.
Inventories fell 2.2% in October from a year earlier.
Gross domestic product rebounded at a historic 33.1% annualized growth rate in the third quarter, thanks to more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers. That followed a 31.4% rate of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.
Inventories added to GDP growth last quarter after being a drag for five straight quarters. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate because of a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases and the largely expired fiscal stimulus.
Stocks of motor vehicles and parts slipped 0.2% in October after declining 0.4% in September. There were increases in stocks of lumber, electrical equipment, hardware, paper, drugs, groceries and farm products. Motor vehicle inventories fell as did stocks of furniture, petroleum, professional equipment and machinery.

Sales at wholesalers accelerated 1.8% in October after rising 0.4% in September. At October's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.31 months to clear shelves, down from 1.32 months in September.

1082,By Investing.com,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 11:15PM ET</span>","China Sees Fall in Consumer Prices, Slower Fall in Factory Gate Prices","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Chinese factory gate prices saw a slower fall in November, with cautious signs of continued economic recovery from COVID-19. However, consumer prices saw a fall for the first time in over 10 years as food prices fell.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) contracted 0.6% month-on-month, below the 0.2% contraction in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 0.3% contraction. The CPI contracted 0.5% year-on-year, below the forecast 0.8% growth and October’s 0.5% growth.
The producer price index (PPI) contracted 1.5% year-on-year, above the 1.8% contraction in the forecasts and October’s 2.1% contraction. The contraction was smaller than expected, indicating that the PPI fell at a slower pace.
Volatile food prices, namely an easing of pork prices from the previous year’s spike after African Swine Fever decimated China’s pig herd, was the main driver behind the CPI’s fall year-on-year. However, November’s core inflation, which excludes food and energy costs, remained unchanged from October at 0.5%.
The grim data indicates unevenness in world’s second largest economy, even as other data from November showed a steady economic recovery.
Trade data from earlier in the week showed that exports increased 21.1% year-on-year in November and the trade balance grew to $75.42 billion in November, against the forecast $53.50 billion and October’s figure of $58.44 billion, while imports grew 4.5% year-on-year in November, missing the predicted 6.1% growth and October’s 4.7% growth.
Data from earlier in December showed the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 57.8, and the Caixin manufacturing PMI at 54.9 respectively in November. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs for November came in at 52.1 and 56.4 respectively.
Some investors warned of the recovery’s unevenness, with the yuan’s appreciation and a sluggish global demand remaining challenges for some sectors. Short-term prospects for global demand remain grim, with California, Germany, South Korea and Hong Kong all announcing tightened restrictive measures to curb upticks in the number of daily COVID-19 cases.
“The CPI deflation is likely to extend into early 2021. A key issue will be how the price trends affect activity more broadly. Factory-gate deflation has been a check on the recent pickup in industrial profits. Now, falling consumer prices could be another risk to earnings. For the People’s Bank of China, this would be a non-negligible consideration,” Bloomberg China economist David Qu told Bloomberg."

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>","China's factory prices fall at slower pace in November, consumer prices decline","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory gate prices fell at a slower pace in November, adding to signs that the economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, but consumer prices declined for the first time in over a decade on falling food prices. 
The producer price index (PPI) fell 1.5% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Tuesday. The index was expected to ease 1.8%, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll, after a 2.1% drop in October.
The consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly fell 0.5% in November from a year earlier, the first decline since October 2009, after rising 0.5% in October.
Analysts in a Reuters poll forecast no change in consumer prices, and the 0.5% fall was lower than any individual forecast in the poll.
The fall in year-on-year CPI was mostly driven by volatile food prices, which dropped 2% from a year ago in November. Core inflation - which excludes food and energy costs - remained benign last month at 0.5%，unchanged from October.
China has seen a steady recovery since it was hard hit by the pandemic in the first quarter of 2020, when authorities imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions to contain the virus.
Recent data showed China's exports grew at the fastest pace in almost three years in November while manufacturing activity also expanded at its quickest rate in more than three years that month.

But some analysts say the recovery has been uneven, with certain sectors struggling with the appreciation of the yuan or with still tepid global demand.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rebounded sharply in October from the previous month's drop, the government said on Wednesday, a welcome development for an economy emerging from a deep coronavirus slump.
The jump in core orders suggests a modest revival in corporate spending, seen by policymakers as necessary to accelerate the recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, soared 17.1% in October, recouping the previous month's 4.4% drop.
The increase, the largest month-on-month rise since comparable data became available in 2005, was much better than a 2.8% expansion forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.
""The global economy is in quite a weak state aside from China, so it's hard to imagine sharp increases in spending aimed at supporting exports,"" said Ayako Sera, market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Bank.
""Domestic production remains in a relatively healthy trend because of a decrease in inventories in April and May.""
By sector, orders from manufacturers rose 11.4%, boosted by non-ferrous metals, including a large order of seven billion yen ($67.22 million), while those from non-manufacturers advanced 13.4%, led by finance and insurance, the Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.
The government raised its assessment on machinery orders, saying they had stopped falling.
Japan's cabinet on Tuesday approved a fresh $708 billion economic stimulus package to boost the economy.
The package includes about $385 billion in direct fiscal spending, while also targeting investment in new growth areas such as green initiatives and digital innovation.
Japan's economy has been recovering from the shock of the coronavirus mainly thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption in the third quarter.
But some policymakers, including the central bank, are worried about a slowdown in capital spending, which threatens to hurt domestic demand.
A government official cautioned that the month-on-month core machinery orders data was subject to an adjustment based on seasonal factors, potentially leading to a downward revision.
Compared to the same month a year earlier, core machinery orders, which exclude those for ships and electricity, rose 2.8% in October, beating an 11.3% decline expected by economists.
Sera said that rise caught her by surprise, and signalled a gradual recovery in capital spending.

""There's no mistake there was a slight recovery in capital expenditure,"" she said, but warned it was too early to call a sustained turnaround.

The number of permanent staff recruited fell for a second month in a row in November and dropped by its most since July, when Britain had just emerged from its first coronavirus lockdown, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said.
""A lot of demand for permanent staff (is) displaced to January as firms hope the COVID crisis is easing. For now though, temporary work continues to help businesses operate and people find jobs,"" REC chief executive Neil Carberry said.
Britain's government has extended a job furlough scheme until the end of March, due to a resurgence in COVID cases, and government forecasters expect the jobless rate to peak at 7.5% after it ends, the highest since the 2013.
While Britain is now rolling out a vaccine against COVID, there has been less progress in trade talks with the European Union before the end of a post-Brexit transition on Jan. 1.
Some 29% of businesses surveyed by the Institute of Directors in the week to Dec. 7 said they were unsure if they would be ready for the end of the transition, which will require exporters to make customs declarations and potentially face tariffs when they ship goods to the EU.

""Right now, Brexit is a moving target for directors. Trying to prepare, while dealing with the impacts of the pandemic, is a tall order,"" IoD director general Jonathan Geldart said, urging Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reach a deal with the EU.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. third-quarter productivity pared; unit labor costs revised up,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. worker productivity increased strongly in the third quarter, though the pace of growth was likely overstated as the sharp rebound in output from the COVID-19 pandemic recession has far outpaced employment gains.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 4.6% annualized rate last quarter. The slight downward revision from the 4.9% pace estimated last month followed a 10.6% rate of growth in the second quarter, which was the fastest since the first quarter of 1971.
The economy expanded at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the July-September quarter, thanks to more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the second quarter. Strong productivity explains the divergence between GDP growth and the labor market.
The economy has recouped two-thirds of output lost during the coronavirus crisis, while only about 56% of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. A wide gap between output and employment is not unusual during recessions, with a similar trend observed during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity growth would be unrevised at a 4.9% rate in the third quarter. The COVID-19 downturn has decimated lower-wage industries, like leisure and hospitality, which economists say tend to be less productive. 
According to Moodys' Analytics chief economist, Mark Zandi, there has been a shift in economic activity to big companies from small and medium-sized retailers. Zandi also noted that big businesses across industries are taking advantage of the pandemic to aggressively implement labor-saving technology.
""The underlying rate of productivity has not shifted from what it was before,"" said Zandi. ""There is no fundamental shift in productivity growth going forward, but it means it's going to take a while to recover all the jobs lost unless we have good policy in place.""
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
Compared to the third quarter of 2019, productivity increased at a 4.0% rate instead of the 4.1% pace reported last month.
Hours worked rebounded at a 37.1% rate, rather than the 36.8% rate estimated in November. That followed a record 42.9% pace of decline in the second quarter.
Unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - plunged at a 6.6% rate instead of an 8.9% rate as previously reported. Unit labor costs rose at a 12.3% pace in the second quarter. They increased at a 4.0% rate from a year ago.
""The big swings in the unit labor costs data in recent quarters make it hard to detect an underlying trend, but overall we think that the shock to the economy coming from COVID-19 should weigh on employee compensation,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

Hourly compensation fell at a 2.3% rate last quarter, instead of a 4.4% pace as previously reported. That followed a 24.3% rate of acceleration in the second quarter. Compensation increased at a 8.2% rate compared to the third quarter of 2019.

The ZEW economic research institute said its survey of investors' economic sentiment moved up to 55.0 from 39.0 in the previous month. A Reuters poll had forecast a reading of 45.5.
""The announcement of imminent vaccine approvals makes financial market experts more confident about the future,"" ZEW President Achim Wambach said in a statement.
A separate gauge of current conditions fell, however, to -66.5 from -64.3 in the previous month. That compared with a consensus forecast of -66.0 points.
Germany is rushing to prepare vaccination centres across the country so it can start offering shots quickly once a vaccine has been approved in Europe. Britain began the mass vaccination of its population against COVID-19 on Tuesday.
The investor morale data reinforced other positive news on the German economy, which grew by 8.5% quarter-on-quarter from July through September after plunging 9.8% plunge in the second quarter during first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Booming car sales drove a stronger-than-expected jump in German industrial output in October, in a further sign that export-oriented manufacturing helped the economy to get off to a solid start in the fourth quarter.
The German government has unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help companies and consumers get through the COVID-19 pandemic as unscathed as possible, including incentives to buy electric and hybrid cars.
Industrial output was up by 3.2% on the month in October after an upwardly revised increase of 2.3% the month before, figures released by the Federal Statistics Office showed on Monday. That was the biggest increase since June.

Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19-country bloc increased by 12.5% in the July-September period from the second quarter, the largest rise since the agency began collecting data in 1995.
This was a slight downward revision from the 12.6% estimate from November. Year-on-year, this amounted to a contraction of 4.3%, slightly above the previous estimate of a 4.4% drop.
The revision was mostly due to a change in the estimates for the second quarter, when the euro zone economy shrank by a record 11.7% on the quarter, against the figure issued in November of 11.8%.
The summer surge was driven by domestic consumption and exports, Eurostat data showed, as shops and factories reopened following lockdowns.
Consumer spending rose by 14.0% in the third quarter from the second, when it fell by 12.4%. Exports increased by 17.1% after an 18.9% drop in April-June.
Eurostat said household consumption contributed 7.3 percentage points the euro zone growth and exports 7.6 points. Government spending contributed 1.1 points.
Most Mediterranean countries posted GDP rises above the bloc's average, with France, Spain and Italy leading the pack, after record contractions in the previous quarter.

Employment in the euro zone increased by 1.0% in the third quarter after a 3.0% decline in the second, Eurostat said in the same release, slightly revising upwards its previous estimate for July-Sept.

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales growth slowed in November when non-essential stores shut as part of a four-week lockdown in England, but online sales were able to fill more of the gap than in the first lockdown in March, industry data showed on Tuesday.
The British Retail Consortium said year-on-year total retail sales growth slowed to 0.9% in November from 4.9% in October, the weakest spending growth since a 5.9% fall in May.
A measure of like-for-like sales - which includes online retail and stores that were able to remain open - rose by 7.7% compared with a year earlier, the biggest gain since June.
""Some retailers were able offset a proportion of lost sales through greater online and click-and-collect sales, ensuring they could still serve their customers,"" Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said.
For others, the coronavirus has proved the final straw. Last week 242-year-old department store chain Debenhams said it would close if it could not find a new owner and Arcadia, which operates many of Britain's best-known high street clothing chains, entered administration.
Britain's economy shrank by a record 20% during the three months to June, which covered most of the first lockdown, but the Bank of England expects a much smaller 2% decline during the final three months of 2020 in response to more recent closures.
Non-essential shops and most hospitality and entertainment venues had to close to the public in England between Nov. 5 and Dec. 2, and there were similar restrictions elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The BRC data covered Nov. 1 to Nov. 28.
Barclaycard, which processes around half of British credit and debit card payments, said consumer spending between Oct. 24 and Nov. 20 was 1.9% lower than a year earlier.
The fall in spending masks big differences between sectors.
Spending at supermarkets was up 24%, and online food shopping was 98% higher than a year earlier, while spending in restaurants and pubs was less than half year-ago levels.
Department stores and clothing retailers, many of whom have struggled to sell online, saw drops in spending of 18% and 13% respectively, Barclaycard said. 

""The big question now is whether Brits will flock to the high street for Christmas shopping after the November lockdown, providing a much-needed boost in December,"" Barclaycard executive Raheel Ahmed said.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The Honduran economy is expected to shrink by a record 10.5% this year due to the combined crisis of the coronavirus and two deadly hurricanes last month, President Juan Orlando Hernandez said Monday, its worst performance in more than six decades.
The contraction was worse than a previous estimate by the country's central bank of between 8% and 9% as the impoverished Central American nation struggled under the weight of the pandemic and hurricanes Eta and Iota.
""This year will be marked in the history of Honduras as the year that three devastating elements hit us,"" said Hernandez, speaking at an event.
""We are hard hit but we are not defeated,"" he added. 
The economic fall for 2020 far exceeds the country's previous record in 1954, when the economy contracted 6.5% due to worker strikes.

Honduras' economy was paralyzed under months of lockdown provoked by the coronavirus pandemic. Hurricanes Eta and Iota then tore through the region in November, affecting millions of people with massive flooding, destroying infrastructure and claiming at least 100 lives.

The median forecast of 15 analysts surveyed expected inflation to reach 3.42%, down from 4.09% in October.
If the forecast holds, it would mark the lowest consumer inflation rate since the indicator reached 3.33% last June.
The central bank, known locally as Banxico, last month held its benchmark lending rate steady at 4.25% following a 1 1/2-year stretch of rate cuts, saying that lower borrowing costs would help pull inflation closer to its +/- 3% target.
Banxico's next monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Dec. 17. 
Analysts surveyed by the bank separately expect its main interest rate to end the year unchanged at 4.25%, which would be 25 basis points higher than the poll's previous forecast.
In November, prices overall likely rose 0.17% while the core inflation rate, which strips out some volatile food and energy prices, fell 0.05%, the Reuters poll found. It also saw annual core inflation at 3.70%.

LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices showed their biggest annual rise since June 2016 last month, as people sought to move into bigger houses following the COVID lockdown earlier this year, mortgage lender Halifax said on Monday.
House prices in November were 7.6% higher than a year earlier, a slightly faster increase than October's 7.5% annual rise and the biggest increase since June 2016, just before Britain voted to leave the European Union.
Halifax said it did not expect the recent pace of price increases to last as the economic outlook was likely to remain challenging, even with the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines.
""With unemployment predicted to peak around the middle of next year, and the UK's economy not expected to fully recover the ground lost over 2020 for a number of years, a slowdown in housing market activity is likely over the next 12 months,"" Halifax managing director Russell Galley said.

The German government has unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help companies and consumers get through the COVID-19 pandemic as unscathed as possible, including incentives to buy electric and hybrid cars.
Industrial output was up by 3.2% on the month after an upwardly revised increase of 2.3% in the previous month, figures released by the Federal Statistics Office showed on Monday.
That was the biggest increase since June and easily beat a Reuters forecast for a rise of 1.6%.
Compared to February, the month before the COVID-19 pandemic reached Germany, industrial output was down by roughly 5%, the office said. In the car industry, Germany's biggest industrial sector, production rose by nearly 10% on the month but was still roughly 6% below pre-pandemic levels.
""Industry had a very good start into the final quarter of 2020. It's an extraordinarily strong increase,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said.
The surprisingly bullish output figures chimed with data released on Friday that showed industrial orders rose more than expected on the month.
Sentiment surveys and high-frequency data such as truck toll mileage have also pointed to relatively strong manufacturing activity in November despite a partial lockdown imposed to slow a second wave of coronavirus infections.
The lockdown measures, which forced large parts of the services sector to close from Nov. 2, are clouding the outlook for the economy which is expected to stagnate or even shrink in the final three months of the year.
But the decline in gross domestic product in the fourth quarter is likely to be less pronounced than in neighbouring European countries thanks to the strong performance of the manufacturing sector, Gitzel added.
Looking further ahead, production expectations in the industrial sector have deteriorated for the coming months, with consumer-orientated industries in particular feeling gloomier about their prospects, the Ifo institute said on Monday.
""Even as industrial orders are pointing to a continuation of the recovery, the further development in manufacturing remains uncertain in light of the pandemic and the partial lockdown,"" the economy ministry said.

Germany's gross domestic product grew by a stronger-than-expected 8.5% quarter-on-quarter from July through September following an unprecedented 9.8% plunge in the second quarter due to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rose at the fastest pace in almost three years in November, as strong global demand for goods needed to ride out the pandemic landed the world's second-largest economy a record trade surplus.
A brisk factory recovery in China from coronavirus shutdowns earlier this year has far outpaced reopenings seen in major trading partners, many of which are still struggling with outbreaks.
Exports in November rose 21.1% from a year earlier, customs data showed on Monday, the fastest growth since February 2018. It also soundly beat analysts' expectations for a 12.0% increase and quickened from an 11.4% increase in October.
The strong exports come despite the yuan hovering near multi-year peaks against the dollar, which would be welcome news for policymakers concerned about the impact of a weakening greenback on China's trade competitiveness.
Imports rose 4.5% year-on-year in November, slower than October's 4.7% growth, and underperforming expectations in a Reuters poll for a 6.1% increase, but still marking a third straight month of expansion.
Analysts say improving domestic demand and higher commodity prices helped buoy the reading.
""We believe China's export growth could remain elevated for another several months due to the worsening COVID-19 situation overseas,"" the note said.
However, they noted some signs that demand for these pandemic-related goods was losing momentum.
The firm shipments led to a trade surplus for November of $75.42 billion, the largest since at least 1981 when Refinitiv records began. It was also wider than the poll's forecast for a $53.5 billion surplus.
China's exports were supported by strong overseas demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and electronics products for working from home, as well as seasonal Christmas demand, Nomura analysts said in a note.
Booming sales of fridges, toasters and microwaves to households across the locked-down world have helped propel China's manufacturing engine back to life, super-charging demand for key metals like steel, copper and aluminium, after a sharp slump early in the year.
In another sign of buoyant trade, China's export surge and the low turnaround rate of containers from abroad have triggered a recent shortage of containers domestically, state media China Daily reported.
A spate of early indicators showed China's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has stepped up, with manufacturing surveys showing new export orders expanding at a faster pace for November.
That comes despite a sharp appreciation in the yuan in recent months, which some fear could hit exporters. Some firms reported that a strong yuan squeezed profits and reduced export orders in November, the statistics bureau said this week.
The yuan has booked six straight months of gains, its longest such winning streak since late 2014, and is trading at 2-1/2 year highs.
The strong exports widened China's trade surplus with the United States to $37.42 billion in November from $31.37 billion in October.
Chinese buyers nevertheless stepped up purchases of U.S. farm produce including soybeans to fulfill China's pledge in the initial trade deal it signed with the United States in January this year.
While a Biden administration is expected to soften some of the rhetoric seen in strained U.S.-China trade relations in recent years, there are no immediate signs the President-elect intends to unwind the punitive tariffs introduced under the Trump administration.
Although China's imports were weaker than expected, volumes continued to rise on a sequential basis, said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics.
""We expect goods imports to grow further into 2021, underpinned by strong domestic demand, with imports of capital goods to be better supported than those of commodities,"" Kuijs said.

China's iron ore and copper imports both fell in November from the previous month, customs data showed. Crude oil imports in rose as customs continued to clear a backlog.

Investing.com – China saw the biggest surge in November exports since February 2018, benefiting from a recovery in global demand. Imports also saw growth.
Data released earlier in the day showed that exports increased 21.1% year-on-year in November, much higher than the 12% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 11.4% growth. The trade balance also grew to $75.42 billion in November, against the forecast $53.50 billion and October’s figure of $58.44 billion.
Meanwhile, imports grew 4.5% year-on-year in November, missing the predicted 6.1% growth and October’s 4.7% growth.
The latest data attests to a continuous Chinese economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Data released earlier in the month showed the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 57.8, and the Caixin manufacturing PMI at 54.9 respectively in November. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs for November came in at 52.1 and 56.4 respectively.
Virus waves in places such as the U.K., Europe and the U.S. could further increase demand for exports of personal protective gear and work-from-home devices, both key drivers of export growth so far.
However, fresh restrictions could also curb global growth and demand, which will inevitably weigh on exports. “The new lockdown in Europe may bring downward pressures to external demand over time,” UBS Group AG (SIX:UBSG) economists led by Ning Zhang said in a note ahead of the data release.
As 2020 draws to an end, China also needs to increase its imports from the U.S. in order to meet the terms of the phase-one trade deal between the two countries. However, the latest data indicates that China is nowhere close to meeting the target agreed on in the deal.
U.S. president-elect Joe Biden has said that he would not quickly remove the tariffs imposed by the incumbent Donald Trump administration. Biden will also consult allies before developing a China strategy."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy added the fewest workers in six months in November, hindered by a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases that, together with a lack of more government relief money, threatens to reverse the recovery from the pandemic recession.
The closely watched employment report also showed 3.9 million people had been out of work for at least six months, with many giving up, a sign of lack of confidence in the labor market. The report, which only covered the first two weeks of November, when the current wave of coronavirus infections started, underscored the challenges facing President-elect Joe Biden when he takes over from President Donald Trump in January.
The economy has recouped only 12.4 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April. Even with a vaccine on the way, economists are warning of a bleak winter and urged Congress to provide additional fiscal stimulus.
""The recovery is stalling and fragile at best,"" said Sung Won Sohn, finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. ""The onset of winter and resurgence of the virus could knock the economy into another dip before the vaccine and additional stimulus from Washington come to the rescue.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 245,000 jobs last month after rising by 610,000 in October. That was the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and the fifth straight monthly slowdown in job growth. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls would increase by 469,000 jobs in November. Hiring peaked at 4.781 million jobs in June.
Job growth last month was held back by further departures of temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census. Local governments continued to shed more workers, especially at schools, causing overall government payrolls to drop by 99,000 jobs, the third straight monthly decline. The private sector added 344,000 jobs.
The retail sector lost 35,000 jobs. Retailers typically embark on seasonal hiring in November, a practice that has been upended by the pandemic. This disruption likely threw off the model the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data.
But hiring in transportation and warehousing increased by 145,000 jobs, accounting for nearly three-fifths of the payroll gains. Employment also increased in the professional and business services, financial activities and health care industries. Construction payrolls increased by 27,000 jobs and manufacturers added 27,000 positions.
The smaller-than-expected job gains added to reports on consumer spending, manufacturing and services industries in suggesting that the recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression was losing steam.
""At this rate, complete stagnation or job losses in December would not be a huge surprise,"" said Beth Akers, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. ""It's hard to imagine that the remaining jobs we lost early this spring will return until we've successfully distributed a vaccine that would allow businesses to return to normal operations.""
U.S. stocks rose as the jobs report reinforced expectations for more government aid. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
LONG BOUTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
The United States is in the midst of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections. Nearly 200,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday and hospitalizations approached a record 100,000 patients, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
A bipartisan, $908 billion coronavirus aid plan gained momentum in Congress on Thursday as conservative lawmakers expressed their support and leaders in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives huddled together.
More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief approved earlier this year helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. The uncontrolled pandemic and lack of additional fiscal stimulus could result in the economy contracting in the first quarter of 2021.
While the unemployment rate fell to 6.7% from 6.9% in October, that was because 400,000 people dropped out the labor force. It was also biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" Without this error, the jobless rate would have been about 7.1%.
(Graphic: Long-term unemployment rises during the pandemic https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlanrbpb/Pasted%20image%201607030256721.png)
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 61.5% from 61.7% in October. The share of women in the labor force dipped last month. Industries that tend to employ women have been hard hit by the recession.
Many women have also quit jobs to look after children as education departments moved to online learning. Just over half of the 8 million people who left the labor force between February and April have returned.
The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more jumped 385,000 in November. These long-term unemployed accounted for 36.9% of the 10.7 million unemployed last month. About 3.743 million people permanently lost their jobs, up 59,000 from October.

Despite the ample slack in the labor market, average hourly earnings rose 0.3% after nudging up 0.1% in October. That left the year-on-year increase in wages at 4.4%. The average workweek was steady at 34.8 hours.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders rose 1.0% after increasing 1.3% in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders increasing 0.8% in October.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy, is being supported by a shift in demand towards goods from services because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But there are clouds gathering for the sector. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported this week that its index of national factory activity dropped in November because of the coronavirus.
The Commerce Department also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 0.8% in October instead of 0.7% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, accelerated 2.4%. They were previously reported to have jumped 2.3%. 

Business spending on equipment rebounded in the third quarter, ending five straight quarters of decline. The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

The Commerce Department said on Friday the trade gap rose 1.7% to $63.1 billion in October. Data for September was revised to show a $62.1 billion deficit instead of $63.9 billion as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall increasing to $64.8 billion in October.
Imports increased 2.1% to $245.1 billion. Goods imports gained 2.1% to $207.8 billion. Exports accelerated 2.2% to $182.0 billion. Goods exports jumped 3.0% to $126.3 billion.

Trade was a drag on gross domestic product in the third quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2019. The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the July-September period. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the second quarter.

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market weakened dramatically in November, as a fresh wave of the coronavirus put the brakes on hiring across the country.
Nonfarm payrolls grew by only 245,000 through the middle of the month, a sharp slowdown from October. October’s job gains were also revised down to 610,000 from an initial estimate of 638,000.
Analysts had expected an increase of 469,000. 
The sharp slowdown in hiring is likely to put extra pressure on Congress to agree a fiscal relief package during the 'lame duck' session before the inauguration of Joe Biden in January. 
The thought that a weaker-than-expected report could tip Senate Republicans into accepting a bigger stimulus package than the $500 billion proposed by Leader Mitch McConnell helped to support stock futures after the announcement. Dow futures initially spiked higher, but quickly retraced their gains and by 8:55 AM ET (1355 GMT), they were at 30,026 points, some 15 points below where they were immediately before the release. 
The net addition of jobs was the smallest in the six months since May, when an unprecedented wave of layoffs followed the first lockdowns of the pandemic. That will reinforce suspicions that the rebound in the economy since May is running out of steam, as millions of Americans lose their entitlement to enhanced unemployment benefits while companies in the worst-hit sectors step up the pace of layoffs. The retail sector notched a decline of 35,000 jobs in the month, the Labor Department said in its report. 
Anything below the consensus forecast ""would suggest that the best of the jobs market really is behind us,"" Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) strategist John Velis wrote ahead of the report. 
Private payrolls grew by 344,000, roughly in line with ADP’s estimate early in the week, but government payrolls fell by 99,000. The leisure and hospitality industry, by contrast, added 31,000 jobs.
The unemployment rate fell by more than expected nonetheless, to a post-pandemic low of 6.7%. The so-called U6 jobless rate, which measures under-employment across the economy more broadly, edged down to 12.0% from 12.1%.
Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a morning note on Friday that the labor market is caught between two contradicting influences. On the one hand, the downturn was not the result of fundamental imbalances, and should therefore be able to rebound quickly to its pre-pandemic state. On the other, the pandemic has accelerated the pace of structural change, meaning that workers in sunset industries and sectors have been forced into unemployment earlier than would otherwise have been the case. 
That's resulting in a growing mismatch between supply and demand, as millions of older, middle-skilled professionals lose their jobs without having the necessary skills to take such jobs as are being created. Such factors are also slowly starting to be seen in wage developments, where average earnings are steadily running ahead of inflation. Average hourly earnings growth stayed at 4.4% in November, defying expectations of a slowdown to 4.3%."

""Industry is doing well again,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, senior economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg. ""The economic weakness resulting from the pandemic is more or less the result of the services sector. And this will not change soon.""
The Federal Statistics Offices said orders for industrial goods rose by 2.9% in seasonally adjusted terms, compared with a Reuters forecast for an increase of 1.5%. September's figure was upwardly revised to an increase of 1.1%. 
Figures from the Economy Ministry showed domestic orders rose 2.4% on the month while orders from abroad were 3.2% higher. Contracts from the euro zone increased by 0.5%.

A breakdown of the data showed that demand for both capital and intermediate goods had increased while demand for consumer goods had contracted.

Demand rose 2.9%, nearly twice as much as predicted by economists. The Economy Ministry said the gain was led by investment goods, which were particularly well-sought outside the euro area.
As a result, orders for machinery rose some 5% above levels recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.
Germany has benefited from a relatively large manufacturing sector that has adapted to the crisis to keep producing goods. Government-imposed curbs across the euro zone to stop the coronavirus spreading have fallen more heavily on services, slamming nations more reliant on activities such as tourism and leisure.
Still, Germany has extended its own restrictions into 2021. Even before that decision, the Bundesbank warned the economy could stagnate or even shrink in the final three months of the year.
The European Central Bank is poised to boost its emergency monetary stimulus next week to help support the regional economy until vaccines are widely rolled out and a recovery looks more robust.

Exports are expected to have risen 12% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 24 economists, quickening from an 11.4% gain in October.
Booming sales of fridges, toasters and microwaves to households across the locked-down world have helped propel China's mammoth manufacturing engine back to life, super-charging demand for key metals like steel, copper and aluminium, after a sharp slump early in the year.
Imports likely rose 6.1% on-year, also accelerating from the previous month's 4.7% pace, buoyed by improving domestic demand and higher commodity prices.
China's trade surplus is expected to have narrowed a bit to $53.5 billion in November from $58.44 billion in October, according to the poll. The data will be released on Monday.
Improving external demand signalled by November U.S. and European factory surveys, and continued strong shipments of face masks and other medical supplies underpinned exports last month, analysts with China Minsheng Bank said in a note.
""The substitution effect of China's exports will continue to increase as supply capacity of emerging economies has not recovered yet.""
China's official and private manufacturing surveys also showed new export orders expanded at a faster pace.
But some analysts cautioned that surging infections and fresh lockdowns in some of its key trading partners could dent demand for Chinese goods.
A sharp appreciation of the yuan currency in recent months could also cloud the outlook for exporters. Some firms reported that a strong yuan squeezed profits and reduced export orders in November, the statistics bureau said this week.
The yuan has booked six straight months of gains, its longest such winning streak since late 2014, and is trading at 2-1/2 year highs. [CNY/]

UBS forecast China's GDP growth would rebound to 8.2% in 2021, led by exports and domestic consumption. They expect exports to grow by 11% to 12% as the global economy recovers from recession, helped by rapid vaccine development.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims fall; services sector activity slows,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell last week, but remained extraordinarily high amid widespread business restrictions to slow a rising tide of new COVID-19 infections and lack of additional fiscal stimulus.
The bigger-than-expected decline in weekly unemployment claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday was likely influenced by the Thanksgiving Day holiday, which economists said could have impacted the model the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data. 
The pandemic and almost depleted coronavirus relief package are hampering the economic recovery, with services industry activity slowing to a six-month low in November, other data showed. Republicans and Democrats in Congress remained unable to reach agreement on another package on Wednesday, with top Republicans pushing what the Senate's top Democrats dismissed as an ""inadequate, partisan proposal.""
""The Thanksgiving holiday can cause issues with the seasonal adjustment process,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Jobless claims continue to signal a struggling labor market recovery.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 75,000 to a seasonally adjusted 712,000 for the week ended Nov. 28. That followed two straight weekly increases. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 775,000 applications in the latest week. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, one million people filed claims last week.
A government watchdog on Monday said the claims data was inaccurate as the Labor Department was using traditional estimates, which were not appropriate given the economic shock caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Government Accountability Office said state backlogs in processing applications had led to people submitting claims for multiple weeks of retroactive benefits during single reporting periods, inflating the claims data. Unemployment claims hit a record 6.867 million in March and have been stuck above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession.
""Even with some overstatement, millions of individuals are unemployed and receiving jobless benefits,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
The United States is in the midst of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with 4.2 million new cases and more than 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. About 13.6 million people are due to lose government-funded unemployment benefits on Dec. 26.
In separate report on Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading 55.9 last month. That as the lowest reading since May when the recovery started and followed 56.6 in October. The second straight monthly decrease pulled the index further below its 57.3 level in February. 
Companies offered mixed views about business conditions and the economy. Restaurants said they continued to struggle with capacity constraints and logistics, while retailers complained they could not access electronics for their stores and employees which had become scarce as more people work from home. 
Construction companies reported strong business, but expected volume to slow during winter.
Economists shrugged off another survey from Markit IHS showing the services sector hitting its highest level in November since March 2015. This survey has a shorter history compared to ISM. The two surveys use different methodologies.
""Risks are to the downside from new restrictions and closures that will weigh on demand and activity going forward,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
LABOR MARKET STAGNATION
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 569,000 to 5.520 million in the week ending Nov. 21. But the decline in the so-called continuing claims was largely because many had exhausted their eligibility, limited to six months in most states. 
A record 4.569 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 14, up 59,732 from the prior week. At least 20.1 million people were receiving benefits under all programs in mid-November.
The labor market stagnation has been evident in other data.
The ISM reported this week its measure of factory employment contracted in November. The Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"" report showed employment rising in all districts on or before Nov. 20, but the U.S. central bank noted ""for most, the pace was slow, at best.""
The reports support expectations that job growth slowed further in November. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the government's closely watched employment report on Friday is likely to show that farm payrolls increased by 469,000 jobs last month after rising 638,000 in October. 

That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and leave employment 9.609 million below its peak in February. Job growth peaked at a record 4.781 million in June.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services industry activity slowed to a six-month low in November amid widespread restrictions on businesses to control surging COVID-19 infections, bolstering views that the economy's recovery from the pandemic recession was running out of steam.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading 55.9 last month. That as the lowest reading since May when the recovery started and followed 56.6 in October.
The second straight monthly decrease pulled the index further below its 57.3 level in February. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index dipping to 56.0 in November.
The ISM reported on Tuesday that its measure of national manufacturing activity fell in November, with many industries reporting higher rates of absenteeism, short-term shutdowns to sanitize factories and difficulties in returning and hiring workers because of the coronavirus.
The United States is engulfed in a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with 4.2 million new cases and more than 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief, which helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, has either expired or will lapse later this month. That has combined with the coronavirus resurgence to slow consumer spending. The stimulus led to record economic growth in the third quarter.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday proposed a new $908 billion emergency relief package. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been pushing a $500 billion approach that Democrats reject, circulated new draft legislation on the same day. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday President Donald Trump would sign McConnell's proposed package, should Congress approve it.
The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below 5%. Exploding COVID-19 infections and lack of additional stimulus have left some economists anticipating a contraction in the first quarter of 2021.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry dropped to a reading of 57.2 in November from 58.8 in October. It has declined for a second straight month. Backlog orders and export orders also decreased, pointing to a further moderation in services industry activity in the near term.
But the survey's index of services industry employment rose to 51.5 from a reading of 50.1 in October.
That suggests the labor marker recovery continued in November, though at a moderate pace. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 486,000 jobs last month after rising 638,000 in October.
That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. It would leave employment about 9.609 million below its peak in February. Job growth has cooled from a record 4.781 million in June.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's economy grew in the third quarter by the most on record as the easing of anti-coronavirus lockdown measures triggered a strong rebound in activity across most sectors, especially industry and services, while fixed investment jumped sharply.
The rebound from the worst of the pandemic prompted a 7.7% increase in gross domestic product from the prior quarter, government statistics agency IBGE said on Thursday, less than the 9.0% median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The rebound means Brazil's economy is now the size it was in early 2017, after the record second-quarter plunge shrunk it to 2009 levels. It is still 7% smaller than at its peak in 2014.
(Graphic: Brazil GDP https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgzkdrpq/GDPINDEX.png)
The recovery was broad-based: industry grew 14.8%, household consumption 7.6%, fixed investment 11.0% and government spending 3.5%. Services, which account for over two thirds of all activity, grew by 6.3%, IBGE said.
Agriculture contracted slightly in the quarter by 0.5%.
The rebound shows that the economic hit from the COVID-19 pandemic has been lighter in Brazil than in other major Latin American economies. But that is in large part due to the government's income transfers to millions of poor families, which are due to expire at the end of this year.
""If you look at household consumption, it is impossible to separate the recovery from the emergency aid. Impossible. Given that the program was reduced in the fourth quarter ... that will be reflected in the Q4 numbers,"" said Jose Francisco Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator in Sao Paulo.
""Next year, there will be no program, and the government, economists and media are underestimating the impact this will have on growth,"" he said.
The Economy Ministry disagreed entirely. In a statement, it said the ""strong recovery"" shown in the latest figures means the economy can continue growing in the first half of 2021 without emergency government support.
""It is important to stress that the resumption of activity and employment in recent months will offset the reduction in aid,"" it said.
The third quarter figures meant Latin America's largest economy shrank 3.9% from the same three-month period a year ago, more than the 3.5% decline forecast in a Reuters poll.
First quarter GDP figures were revised to -1.5% from -2.5%, the second quarter to -9.6% from -9.7%, and 2019 growth was revised up to 1.4% from 1.1%, IBGE said.

In the first nine months of this year, the economy was 5.0% smaller than it was in the same period last year, it added.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell for the first time in three weeks last week, although it remained at a level unimaginable before the pandemic. 
The Labor Department said that initial jobless claims fell to 712,000, from an upwardly revised 787,000 a week earlier. Analysts had expected a drop to 775,000.
The number of continuing claims, which comes in with a one-week lag, also fell by more than expected to 5.52 million from 6.09 million.
The numbers come a day after payrolls processor ADP said that private-sector hiring in the month through mid-November was relatively modest. Private payrolls grew by 307,000, well short of the 410,000 expected. The official government labor market report is due out on Friday and is expected to show a 469,000 increase in nonfarm employment and a jobless rate of 8.9%
Standard & Poor's said on Thursday that it only expects the number of U.S. jobless to return to its pre-pandemic level in 2023.
Separately, the Challenger Job Cuts survey suggested that the pace of layoffs across the U.S. fell to its slowest since the beginning of the health crisis this year, showing just under 65,000 job losses in November, compared to over 80,000 in October. The year-on-year comparison also improved to a rise of 'only' 65% from 80% in October."

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity contracted last month as governments across the bloc re-imposed strict lockdowns to quell a second wave of coronavirus infections, but optimism recovered on hopes for a vaccine, a survey showed.
The euro zone's economy will shrink again this quarter, a Reuters poll predicted, but as a coronavirus vaccine comes closer and with expectations for additional support from the European Central Bank, quarterly growth forecasts for next year were upgraded. 
IHS Markit's composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, sank to 45.3 in November from October's 50.0, the level separating growth from contraction. That was, however, above an earlier flash reading of 45.1.
""There is a sense that after the initial reactions of businesses to the lockdowns, the second half of the month was better than anticipated. It's still bad but not as bad as expected,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).
A PMI covering the bloc's dominant services industry sank to 41.7 from October's 46.9, marking its third month below the break-even mark. That was its lowest reading since May, when the first wave of the virus was sweeping across Europe.
With hospitality venues forced to close, shops to shut and citizens encouraged to stay at home, demand slumped. The services new business index fell to 40.6 from 45.7.
Germany's second lockdown pushed services there deeper into recession, bringing overall private-sector growth in Europe's largest economy to a near halt. French business activity retreated as the already-suffering service sector was hit particularly hard.
Italy's services industry contracted for a fourth month running. Spain's also shrank again.
In Britain, outside the European Union, services shrank less than expected. A four-week partial lockdown in England had a smaller impact on companies than a lockown earlier in the year, but some analysts were cautious. 
""Many businesses that were forced to close last month during the second lockdown will have seen revenues drop to near zero. The PMI, however, merely reflects whether firms’ activity is rising or falling, not by how much,"" said Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
""Its past relationship with the GDP data, therefore, is bound to understate the damage caused by the lockdown.""
But overall optimism about the coming year improved and the euro zone composite future output index jumped to 60.4 from 56.5.

""The fact the vaccine is close at hand means there is reason for optimism in 2021,"" Dixon said.

The IHS Markit/CIPS UK services Purchasing Managers' Index of business activity (PMI) fell to 47.6 in November from 51.4 in October. 
This was the first time since June that it fell below the 50 level that divides growth from contraction, but a smaller drop than the decline to 45.8 in an earlier 'flash' estimate or the record-low reading of 13.4 in April.
The composite PMI, which includes manufacturers who enjoyed stronger growth, dropped to 49.0 from 52.1, also the lowest since June but a smaller drop than an initial estimate of 47.4.
""New lockdown measures and tighter pandemic restrictions unsurprisingly tipped UK private sector output back into decline. However, the collateral damage on sectors outside of hospitality, leisure and travel has been far more modest than in the first lockdown period,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
Britain's economy suffered a record 25% fall in output during the first lockdown in March and April, but the Bank of England forecast this month that output would fall just 2% in the final three months of 2020.
While some sectors such as retail - which is not covered by the PMI - and hospitality have been hard hit by the second lockdown, others have found it easier to adapt, IHS Markit said.
News of effective COVID-19 vaccines this month has also boosted business optimism in the services PMI, which rose to its strongest since February's five-year high.
Job losses continued for a ninth consecutive month, however, the longest continuous run since 2010, and unemployment is forecast to rise further during the months it will take to roll out the vaccine to millions of Britons.
November's survey took place from Nov. 12-26, after initial reports of the success of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against COVID. The 'flash' data published on Nov. 23 was based on responses collected up to Nov. 19, before news of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and the University of Oxford's successful vaccine trials.

The improvement in the survey between the flash and the final data was concentrated in the business activity index, with little change in the expectations component.

Restaurants, bars, hotels, gyms and entertainment venues have been closed since Nov. 2 to contain an aggressive second wave of coronavirus infections. Factories and shops remain open with social distancing conditions in place.
IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.0 from 49.5 the previous month.
The reading came in lower than a flash estimate of 46.2 and marked the second month in a row that the services index was below the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction.
The main drag came from hospitality and restaurants, but other consumer-focused services were also severely hit by the renewed lockdown measures.
However, the survey suggested a far smaller overall contraction of gross domestic product compared with that seen in spring following the first lockdown, as activity remained solid in those sectors not affected by the partial lockdown.
""The extension of lockdown measures into December means it is going to be a difficult end to the year for the German economy, of course, for some sectors more than others,"" Phil Smith from IHS Markit said.
Progress on COVID-19 vaccines has helped brighten the outlook for many businesses, though it remains a long road to full recovery, Smith added.
The drop in services activity was partly offset again by robust growth in manufacturing in November.

The final composite PMI, which covers both sectors of the economy, fell to 51.7 from 55.0 in October. That was weaker than the flash reading of 52.0.

Investing.com – China’s services sector saw accelerated growth in November, with new business rising at the fastest pace in over ten years and indicating even further recovery in consumer demand in the world’s second largest economy.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for November, released earlier in the day, came in at 57.8, above the 56.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 56.8 figure.
The survey also showed that total new business hit the highest level since April 2010 in November, with new export business expanding for the first time in five months. Services firms also hired more workers at a much faster pace for the fourth straight month in November business confidence improved to its highest levels in over nine-and-a-half years.
The stronger demand allowed firms to pass on some of their higher costs to clients by raising output prices, with a sub-index for prices charged rising to the highest level since February 2010.
The survey also caps off a stellar November for China, with the services PMI following positive data released earlier in the week. The Caixin manufacturing PMI came in at 54.9, and manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs came in at 52.1 and 56.4 respectively.
Although the data suggests that China’s overall economic recovery is becoming more balanced and broader based, challenges remain. Scattered COVID-19 cases reported in some parts of the country could dampen consumer activity. The ever-increasing number of global COVID-19 cases globally are also expected to dampen exports.
The Chinese economy is forecast to grow about 2% in 2020, its weakest figure since 1976 but still above the forecasts for other major economies.
However, some investors are hopeful that the recovery momentum will continue for a few more months.
“To sum up, both the manufacturing and service sectors recovered at a faster pace as overseas demand kept expanding and employment saw substantial improvement,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a statement accompanying the data release.
“We expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to continue for several months. At the same time, deciding how to gradually withdraw the easing policies launched during the epidemic will require careful planning as uncertainties still exist inside and outside China,” Wang said, in reference to crisis measures unveiled earlier in the year to support the economy during the COVID-19 lockdown."

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 57.8, the second highest reading since April 2010, from October's 56.8. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Total new business in November hit the highest level since April 2010, with new export business expanding for the first time in five months, the survey showed.
Services firms hired more workers for the fourth straight month in November and at a much faster pace, the survey found, while business confidence improved to the highest in over nine-and-a-half years. 
The strong rebound was largely in line with the findings in an official survey released on Monday, suggesting China's overall economic recovery is becoming more balanced and broader based, despite concerns that scattered COVID-19 cases found in some parts of the country could weigh on consumer activity.
Analysts expect the recovery momentum could run for a few more months. 
""To sum up, both the manufacturing and service sectors recovered at a faster pace as overseas demand kept expanding and employment saw substantial improvement,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in an statement accompanying the data release.

The survey also showed stronger demand enabled firms to pass on some of their higher costs to clients by raising output prices. A sub-index for prices charged rose to the highest since February 2010. 
The services sector accounts for about 60% of China's economy and half of the urban jobs, and includes many small, private companies which had been slower to recover initially from the health crisis than large manufacturers. 
Caixin's composite manufacturing and services PMI, also released on Thursday, picked up to 57.5 from 55.7 in October, to signal the steepest increase in total Chinese output since March 2010. 

Analysts expect China's economy to grow about 2% in 2020, the weakest since 1976 but still far stronger than other major economies.

The world's third-largest economy has been gradually recovering from a virus-induced slump earlier this year, but it is expected to take years before it will return to pre-pandemic levels, especially within the service sector, which contributes nearly 70% of its gross domestic product.
The final Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was little changed from October's reading, edging up to a seasonally adjusted 47.8 from 47.7.
Though the final result was better than a preliminary 46.7 reading, the headline index remained firmly in contraction territory below the 50 neutral level.
Surveyed firms said a third wave of COVID-19 infections had depressed demand and led to more challenging business conditions.
""There were indications that the tentative recovery in the Japanese service sector lost momentum,"" said Usamah Bhatti, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""A sharper fall in new business signified that demand remains fragile amid short-term uncertainty surrounding the length of the pandemic.""
The main reading was weighed by a faster contraction of new business, which fell at the quickest pace in three months.
Job market conditions also eased, slipping back into contraction, though the pace of job shedding remained minimal, the survey showed.
A draft of the government's next stimulus package seen by Reuters showed authorities plan to keep setting aside money to promote domestic tourism and dining out, a move that will support an industry reeling under the fallout of the health crisis and the collapse of international tourism.
Still, the PMI survey showed firms remained optimistic about the outlook for the 12 months ahead, in part thanks to an anticipated boost from the delayed Tokyo Olympic Games next year.
The composite PMI including both manufacturing and services was also largely unchanged at 48.1 in November from the previous month's final of 48.0.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in November as soaring new COVID-19 infections led to a wave of business restrictions, adding to signs of slowing economic activity as a turbulent year winds down.
The slowdown in private hiring in the ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday puts pressure on Congress to agree on additional fiscal stimulus to aid the recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.
Republicans and Democrats in Congress remained unable to reach agreement on a fresh relief package on Wednesday, with top Republicans supporting what the Senate's top Democrats dismissed as an ""inadequate, partisan proposal.""
President-elect Joe Biden will inherit a struggling labor market and public health crisis when he takes over from President Donald Trump on Jan. 20.
""The rapid spread of the virus across the nation is making it harder to find employment this fall and this puts the entire economic recovery from recession in jeopardy if Congress can't get it together and vote on a new stimulus package before the end of the year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Private payrolls rose by 307,000 jobs last month after increasing 404,000 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would rise by 410,000 in November. The slowdown in hiring last month was across all industries. 
The leisure and hospitality sector, hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, added 95,000 jobs. Construction employment increased by 22,000 jobs and manufacturers hired 8,000 workers. There were employment gains in financial activities, professional services, education and healthcare sectors. The information industry added no jobs.
The United States has been slammed by a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with 4.2 million new cases and more than 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data. 
The resurgence in coronavirus infections and expiring fiscal stimulus are hampering consumer spending and production at factories. More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. 
New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams (NYSE:WMB) on Wednesday acknowledged growth was slowing due to the spreading COVID-19 cases and lack of more fiscal stimulus.
That sentiment was also evident in the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts across the nation, which described the economic expansion as ""modest or moderate."" 
The U.S. central bank noted four districts described little or no growth.
U.S. stocks were muted. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LOSING STEAM
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Though it has fallen short of the government's private payrolls count since May because of methodology differences, it is still watched for clues on the labor market's health.
""The broad message from the ADP report is consistent with what we expect the government data to show, the labor market continued to add jobs on net in November but the pace of job growth slowed,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
The ADP report was released ahead of the government's closely watched, and comprehensive, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, private nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 589,000 jobs in November after rising 906,000 in October. 
With government payrolls expected to have declined again last month as temporary workers hired for the Census left and state and local government struggle with weakened budgets, overall nonfarm payrolls are forecast increasing by 486,000 jobs after rising 638,000 in October. 
That would the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and leave employment 9.609 million below its peak in February. Job growth peaked at a record 4.781 million in June. 
Authorities across the country have imposed new restrictions on businesses and other places where crowds congregate. While the measures are not as tough as in March when the coronavirus pandemic started in the United States, they have had a chilling effect on the labor market.
First-time applications for unemployment benefits have increased for two straight weeks. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed a decline in the number of employees working in November compared to October. 
A survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday showed its measure of factory employment contracted in November after expanding in October for the first time since July 2019. Manufacturers cited high rates of absenteeism and difficulties returning people to work and hiring staff due to COVID-19.

The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below 5%.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese industrial activity has snapped back to pre-coronavirus growth levels, with factory surveys hitting multi-year highs in November, but the headline expansion masks struggles for smaller firms and looming pressures for exporters.
Readings from the official and Caixin's Purchasing Managers Indexes hit three- and 10-year highs respectively last month, a reflection of the industrial sector's strong overall recovery.
Official data also shows industrial profits for large firms grew at their fastest pace since 2017 in October.
Equipment, electronics and auto manufacturing have performed particularly well, helped by state subsidies targeting consumption of cars and white goods.
But behind the strong headline numbers, many smaller firms, which employ the majority of China's workforce and are traditionally its collective engine of industry, are still struggling, say official data and analysts.
""The recovery is uneven, because it's driven by investment and construction, and mainly for large firms,"" said Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank (China).
""Monetary policy has been tight since June, so small firms face a widespread liquidity shortage.""
Following a string of supportive measures this year, China's central bank has shifted to a more steady stance as the economy rebounds.
After a string of high-profile bond defaults, the PBOC this week unexpectedly injected 200 billion yuan (23 billion pounds) through its one-year medium-term lending facility, in an apparent bid to soothe market nerves.
Official data shows the recovery of factory activity for smaller firms has lagged well behind that of larger ones since the coronavirus stalled industrial activity earlier in the year.
Small firms' factory activity only accelerated in two of the past six months, and at a much slower pace than that of larger ones.
""The recovery of the manufacturing industry is still uneven,"" said Zhao Qinghe, an official of the National Bureau of Statistics, in comments released along with November PMI data.
Certain sectors, such as textiles, have seen factory activity continue to decelerate every month this year, Zhao added.
EXPORT UNCERTAINTIES
Exporters also face uncertainties from the appreciation of the yuan currency and uncertain global demand, say analysts.
The currency started its appreciation trend in June and booked six straight months of gains, its longest such winning streak since late 2014. It has risen nearly 9% against the dollar since late May.
Some firms reported that a strong yuan squeezed profits and reduced export orders in November, said Zhao.
""Now the expectation is RMB will continue to hike and that can wipe out more small export firms,"" said Hang Seng's Wang, referring to the renminbi, another name for the yuan.
China has posted surprisingly strong headline export data for months, helped by strong foreign demand for medical supplies and electronics products and continuing virus-related disruptions of other countries' production.
Surging infections and fresh lockdowns in some key trading partners could dent demand for some Chinese exports. But bringing the virus under control overseas could also reduce its competitive advantage in producing other goods.

""China exports - and profits of export-oriented industrial firms - may face some headwinds if other major economies regain market share,"" said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>",German retail sales rebound before partial lockdown,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rebounded more than expected in October, data showed on Wednesday, suggesting consumers supported overall growth in Europe's largest economy before a partial lockdown to contain a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
Germany has ordered restaurants, bars, entertainment venues and gyms to close since Nov. 2 in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19. Schools, factories and shops remain open with social distancing conditions.
Retail sales - a notoriously volatile indicator often subject to revisions - rose 2.6% in October on the month in real terms, the Federal Statistics Office said.
That followed an upwardly revised drop of 1.9% in September and compared with a Reuters forecast for a rise of 1.2%.
On the year, retail sales jumped 8.2%, beating a Reuters forecast for a rise of 5.9%.
Demand was particularly strong for furnishings and household appliances.
Online retailers continued to benefit from shifting consumer habits with a strong jump in sales, which came at the expense of clothing and shoe stores which suffered further losses.
Compared with February, the month before the pandemic started in Germany, retail sales were 5.9% higher in real terms, suggesting that the sector has already put the crisis behind it.
The better-than-expected retail sales data followed bullish job market data which showed on Tuesday that unemployment fell further in November despite the partial lockdown.
But a gloomy consumer sentiment survey released by the GfK institute last week suggests the resilient labour market will not automatically translate into higher household spending at the end of the year.

Economic institutes expect Germany's gross domestic product to shrink by about 1% in the fourth quarter after a stronger-than-expected 8.5% rebound in the third and an unprecedented 9.8% plunge in the second quarter.

Gross domestic product expanded 3.3% from the second quarter, when it tumbled by 7%, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney Wednesday. Economists had forecast a 2.5% expansion. From a year earlier, the economy shrank 3.8% versus an estimated 4.4% contraction.
The Australian dollar edged up after the report, trading at 73.87 U.S. cents at 11:34 a.m. in Sydney from 73.78 cents before the data.
The renewed expansion shows how resilient the economy was outside the southeastern state of Victoria, which was under one of the world’s toughest lockdowns for much of the period. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the government delivered significant stimulus early in the pandemic to help households and firms manage.

Auto sales in the United States managed to bounce back since hitting a pandemic-fueled bottom in April, leading major automakers to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships.
However, rising COVID-19 cases in the U.S. states have increased the uncertainty over a speedy rebound.
The seasonally adjusted annualized sales pace for light vehicles dropped to 15.55 million units in November, from 16.21 million units in October and 17.09 million units in the year-ago period, according to Wards Intelligence. 
Still, that is nearly double the 8.58 million units marked in April, when the sales pace hit its lowest since December 1970 due to pandemic-led lockdown restrictions.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that construction spending jumped 1.3% in October. Data for September was revised down to show construction outlays declining 0.5% instead of rising 0.3% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rise 0.8% in October. Construction spending increased 3.7% on a year-on-year basis in October.
Spending on private construction projects advanced 1.4%, fueled by investment in homebuilding amid record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low-density areas. Spending on residential projects shot up 2.9%.
But outlays on nonresidential construction like gas and oil well drilling fell 0.7% in October. The pandemic has crushed oil prices, resulting in a contraction in spending on nonresidential structures in the third quarter. The fourth straight quarterly decline in spending on nonresidential structures bucked a rebound in overall business investment.

Spending on public construction projects increased 1.0% in October.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 04:57PM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity slows; COVID-19 resurgence hits workers,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. manufacturing activity slowed in November, with new orders retreating from their highest level in nearly 17 years, as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the nation kept workers at home and factories temporarily shut down to sanitize facilities.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday warned that absenteeism at factories and their suppliers as well as difficulties in returning and hiring workers would continue to ""dampen"" manufacturing until the coronavirus crisis ended. 
The softening in factory activity supports expectations for a sharp deceleration in economic growth in the fourth quarter amid the raging pandemic and end of fiscal stimulus. 
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday urged Congress to provide more help for small businesses. A bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a new $908 billion emergency relief package for small businesses and millions of unemployed Americans.
""The feared economic slowdown is starting, but it is pretty slow off the blocks,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The ISM's index of national factory activity dropped to a reading of 57.5 last month from 59.3 in October, which had been the highest since November 2018. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would slip to 58 in November. 
Sixteen manufacturing industries, including wood products, machinery and transportation equipment, reported growth last month. Petroleum and coal products, as well as printing and related support activities industries, contracted.
The United States is in the grip of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with 4.2 million new cases and over 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported in November, according to a Reuters tally of official data. The virus is likely to disrupt production at factories. Manufacturing output is still about 5% below its pre-pandemic level, according to the Fed.
More than $3 trillion in government COVID-19 relief has run out. The fiscal stimulus helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. 
Slowing manufacturing activity followed on the heels of data last week showing consumer spending cooling in October. 
The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the third quarter after shrinking at a 31.4% rate in the April-June period, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are mostly below a 5% rate. Exploding COVID-19 infections and lack of additional stimulus have left some economists anticipating a contraction in the first quarter of 2021. 
A second report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed a solid increase in construction spending in October, but outlays in September actually declined instead of rising modestly as was previously estimated.
Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq hitting record highs on hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine would be available soon. The dollar fell to a 2-1/2-year low against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
MIXED VIEWS
Manufacturers last month offered mixed assessments of business conditions. Transportation equipment makers said the flare-up in COVID-19 cases was straining suppliers, with labor the main issue, impacting production. 
In the food industry, factories were ""sending employees home for 14 days to quarantine,"" and ""had to shut down production lines due to lack of staffing."" This led to ""much higher than normal"" production costs, suggesting consumers could soon be paying more at the supermarket at a time when about 13.6 million Americans are due to lose government-funded unemployment benefits a day after Christmas. 
But fabricated metal producers reported strong business and said they expected demand to continue growing in 2021. Machinery manufacturers were also upbeat, though they said the coronavirus remained a concern. 
ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index fell to a reading of 65.1 in November from 67.9 in October, which was the highest reading since January 2004. Manufacturing employment contracted after expanding in October for the first time since July 2019. 
ISM's manufacturing employment gauge dropped to a reading of 48.4 from 53.2 in October. That likely reflects the absenteeism due to the coronavirus as well as layoffs as demand softens. It fits in with economists' expectations that job growth slowed further in November. Manufacturing accounts for more than 10% of private payroll employment.
""Today's news of layoffs in the sector, either planned or unplanned, is a worrisome sign that shows there is not a clear path to winning here for the economic outlook as 2021 approaches,"" Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
According to an early Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 495,000 jobs last month after rising by 638,000 in October. Employment growth has cooled from a record 4.781 million new jobs in June. 

About 12.1 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered. The government is scheduled to publish November's employment report on Friday.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's economy notched record growth in the third quarter, with real GDP expected to climb 0.2% in October, Statistics Canada said on Tuesday, though analysts cautioned the rebound would stagnate in coming months amid renewed COVID-19 restrictions.
Canada's Q3 annualized growth soared 40.5%, rebounding from a historic plunge in the second quarter, while September real GDP rose by 0.8%. Both the quarterly and monthly numbers missed analyst expectations.
Despite the gains, total economic activity remains about 5% below February's pre-pandemic levels, Statscan said. 
""We already knew we had a rapid bounce back in economic activity in the third quarter,"" said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at RBC. ""The concern now is how much of that can be sustained with the accelerating virus spread.""
Canada is in the midst of a harsh second wave of COVID-19 infections and a number of provinces have already imposed new restrictions, and in some cases targeted lockdowns, in an effort to stem the spread.
That will likely impact economic growth, said economists, warning activity could contract late this year, leading to a far smaller Q4 annualized gain.
""Much of the focus is now on the fourth quarter and what happens early next year,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, though he added the ""modest growth"" seen for October was encouraging.
""The economy had a bit of momentum going into the shutdowns,"" he said. 
On Monday, Canada's Liberal-led government unveiled a historic C$381.6 billion deficit and pledged up to C$100 billion in stimulus spending to ""jumpstart"" the recovery, once the virus is under control. 

The Canadian dollar was trading 0.3% higher at 1.2959 to the greenback, or 77.17 U.S. cents.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 55.8 in November from 55.5 in October. Since July, the PMI has been above the 50 threshold that marks expansion in the sector.
""Latest survey data shows encouraging signs at the Canadian manufacturing sector as it continues to recover from the second quarter downturn,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
The output index stayed solidly in expansion territory, dipping to 55.1 from 55.2 in October, which was its highest in more than two years. The measure of new orders also showed solid expansion, while the employment index rose to 52.5 from 51.2.
Canada's national statistical agency is due to release the November labor force survey on Friday. Canada is in the middle of a second wave of the pandemic and daily cases regularly hit record highs despite increasing efforts by the 10 provinces to clamp down on businesses and curb gatherings. 
""With a resurgence in case numbers, and further lockdown measures announced, the (manufacturing) sector could face softer growth prospects or a second dip in the coming months,"" Patel said.
Material shortages, supplier delays and transportation restrictions linked to the pandemic led to another deterioration in vendor performance during November, IHS Markit said. The suppliers' delivery times index fell to 34.2 from 37.4 in October.

But business confidence showed improvement, with the measure of future output rising to 62.9 from 61.4.

The bank's IMACEC economic activity index encompasses about 90% of the economy tallied in gross domestic product figures. The October figure was the economy's best showing since February, when the economy grew 3.3%, bank statistics show.
But economic activity in Chile remained hobbled by the coronavirus outbreak, the bank said, even though cases of COVID-19 have fallen with the onset the southern hemisphere's spring.
The bank said a drop in the production of goods and services had largely driven the contraction, but added the impact was softened by gains in commerce as quarantines were lifted across much of the nation.
Chile's mining activity also grew by 1.6% in October, the bank said, a persistent bright spot during the pandemic.
Most of Chile's sprawling copper mines maintained output even at the height of the country's outbreak in May and June, a lifeline for an economy that depends on metals exports.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 01, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",Euro zone inflation drop adds to ECB stimulus case,"BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation remained in negative territory for the fourth straight month in November, reinforcing European Central Bank concerns that the dip in prices may be more persistent than feared as deflationary forces intensify amid a deep recession.
Annualised price growth in the 19 countries sharing the euro held steady at minus 0.3%, underperforming expectations for minus 0.2%, as energy prices tumbled and the decline in non-energy industrial goods accelerated as Europe implemented lockdown measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Perhaps more worrying for policymakers, a narrower core measure, which excludes food and energy costs, remained steady at 0.4%, well below the ECB's target of almost 2%, an objective it has persistently undershot for more than seven years. 
With the euro zone heading back into recession in the fourth quarter, the ECB has already flagged more stimulus at its December meeting, making the case for more emergency bond buys and cheap liquidity to banks, leaving policymakers only to debate the details of the package. 
Policymakers also argued that the task is to keep financing conditions at their current level, rather than to cut them further, a point also made by ECB board member Isabel Schnabel in an interview with Bloomberg. [F9N2GX01C]
While markets expect a six-month extension of emergency bond buys, Schnabel said that a longer extension is also being considered and it was not the ECB's job to deliver on market expectations.
Inflation is likely to be the main discussion in the December meeting as policymakers are increasingly worried that a deep and lengthy recession makes deflationary forces more permanent. 
Indeed, an even narrower inflation measure, which excludes food, energy, tobacco and alcohol, held steady at 0.2%, indicating that there are barely any underlying price pressures. 
""Policymakers had hoped that most of the fall in inflation since the summer was due to temporary factors including the VAT cut in Germany and atypical times of summer clothes sales,"" Andrew Kenningham at Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
""But the breadth of the fall in inflation since the summer, which has affected all euro zone countries, and its persistence suggest that these temporary factors are not the whole story.""

The ECB now expects negative inflation readings well into early 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - British factories recorded their fastest growth in almost three years last month as they stockpiled raw materials and rushed to complete work before new post-Brexit customs rules come into force on Jan. 1, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 55.6 in November from 53.7 in October, its highest since December 2017 and above an earlier flash reading of 55.2, bucking a gloomier picture from other sectors hit harder by COVID.
""The upcoming end to the Brexit transition period ... led to rising levels of input purchasing, stockpiling of raw materials and stronger gains in new export business as EU-based clients brought forward orders,"" data company IHS Markit said.
Britain and the EU have so far failed to agree a deal to allow tariff-free trade from Jan. 1, and even with a deal many exporters fear lengthy delays at ports due to new customs requirements.
""Whether the upturn of manufacturing production can be sustained into the new year is therefore highly uncertain, especially once the temporary boosts from Brexit purchasing and stockbuilding wane,"" IHS Markit director Rob Dobson said.
November saw the biggest rise in purchases of raw materials since March 2019, the biggest rise in export orders since January 2018, and the sharpest boost to optimism since 2014.
Factory output, which is only one component of the total PMI, also accelerated. But it showed slower growth than over the summer as the second wave of COVID cases reduced demand for some consumer goods, where new orders fell by the most in six months. 
The most recent official data showed that factory output in September was almost 8% lower than a year earlier, similar to the rest of the economy.

Manufacturing is also still experiencing job losses, with the PMI showing that factories cut staff numbers for a tenth consecutive month, the longest decline since the 2008-09 recession after the global financial crisis.

IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.8 in November from October's 54.8 but was ahead of the 53.6 flash estimate. Anything above 50 indicates growth.
An index measuring output which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday that is seen as a good guide to economic health sank to 55.3 from 58.4.
""Although the rate of expansion cooled from October's 32-month high amid new lockdown measures, the sustained expansion should help to soften the economic blow of COVID-19 restrictions, which have hit the service sector hard,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
""The survey therefore adds to evidence the region will avoid in the final quarter of the year a similar scale of downturn recorded in the second quarter.""
While the manufacturing sector continued to expand, an earlier flash reading of the overall survey showed activity in the bloc's dominant service industry contracted last month as a second wave of the coronavirus swept across Europe.
As most of Europe grapples with a resurgence in infections, the euro zone is on track for its first double-dip recession in nearly a decade, according to a Reuters poll of economists last month. [ECILT/EU]
The PMI showed demand waned and factories cut headcount again last month but optimism did improve amid progress in developing COVID-19 vaccines. The future output index rose to 64.8 from 62.7, its highest since March 2018.
""A brighter outlook is indicated by the upturn in optimism for the year ahead, suggesting the upturn should gather strength again in the coming months as lockdown measures ease and spending, especially investment, picks up in response to the recent news on vaccine development,"" Williamson said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian factories recovered further in November from the COVID-19 crisis, surveys showed on Tuesday, thanks to a boom in economic powerhouse China which has enabled the region to withstand the pandemic better than many of its peers.
China's factory activity accelerated at the fastest pace in a decade in November, a private sector survey showed, a sign the world's second-largest economy is rebounding to pre-pandemic levels.
But a global resurgence in coronavirus infections has made the outlook highly uncertain, keeping governments and central banks under pressure to maintain or ramp up their massive stimulus programmes, analysts say.
PMI surveys for other regions due later on Tuesday are expected to show a continued recovery in factory activity in the euro zone, while U.S. manufacturing activity is seen expanding but at a slower pace.
""There is little sign that large second waves of the virus in the U.S. and Europe have weighed on Asia's export-focussed industry, suggesting that external demand will continue to hold up,"" Capital Economics said in a research note.
China's Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 54.9 from October's 53.6, marking the highest level since November 2010. 
The gauge stayed well above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction for the seventh consecutive month. It was also in line with an official survey that showed activity at Chinese factories expanded at the fastest pace in more than three years in November.
A steady recovery in global demand also helped Japan's factory activity move a notch closer to stabilisation in November, and that of South Korea to accelerate at the fastest pace in nearly a decade.
""Overall, it looks likely that Asian industry will remain strong over the coming months, helping economic recoveries to stay on track,"" Capital Economics said.
Asia's performance comes as many countries in the region have had greater success in containing the virus than their U.S. and European peers.
China's economy is seen increasing 1.9% this year, while the U.S. economy is expected to contract 4.3% and euro zone economies by 8.3%, according to the International Monetary Fund's estimate in October.
PATCHY RECOVERY
The surveys on Tuesday showed factory activity also grew in Taiwan and Indonesia, a sign the pick-up in Chinese demand was underpinning the region's economy.
The final au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI hit 49.0 in November, up from the previous month's 48.7 and a preliminary 48.3 reading.
South Korea's IHS Markit PMI rose to 52.9 in November from 51.2 in October, the highest reading since February 2011 and marking the second month of activity expansion.
But India's manufacturing recovery faltered in November as coronavirus fears weighed on demand and output, prompting firms to cut jobs for the eighth month in a row.
That underscored the patchy nature of Asia's outlook, with some analysts still cautious on the outlook with global and domestic demand vulnerable to infection trends. 
""Japan's economy likely slowed in July-September but averted a contraction due to a pick-up in exports and the effect of government campaigns to prop up demand,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.

""But the economy may contract in January-March if households hold off on spending again. If service-sector firms suffering from plunging sales cut spending, that could hit jobs and capital expenditure.""

Investing.com – China’s November factory sector activity grew at the fastest pace since November 2010, as the country’s economy continues its recovery towards pre-COVID-19 levels.
Data released earlier in the day showed that the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) came in at 54.9, above the 50-mark indicating expansion for the seventh consecutive month. It was also above the 53.5 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s figure of 53.6.
The survey also showed that total new orders and factory output reached 10-year highs, although new export orders saw a more modest gain. It also showed a third consecutive month of Chinese factories hiring workers and at a faster pace.
“Manufacturing continued to recover, and the economy increasingly returned to normality as fallout from the domestic COVID-19 epidemic faded,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note accompanying the survey release.
“Supply and demand improved at the same time. Employment recovered markedly and overseas demand kept expanding.” Input and output prices both rose, with respondents to the survey citing a sharp rise in the cost of raw materials, especially metals, Wang said.
The survey also follows data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday, showing the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) at 52.1 and the non-manufacturing PMI at 56.4 in November.
The data demonstrates that China continues to see a strong rebound in activity from its COVID-19 lockdown earlier in the year. Strictly enforced virus containment measures, infrastructure-driven stimulus, strong exports of medical supplies, and pent-up demand have also contributed to the rebound.
E-commerce shopping promotions that took place in November, including Singles’ Day, saw strong consumer demand, bolstering small and medium-sized companies’ confidence. Other economic indicators, including trade and producer prices, hinted at a further pick up in the industrial sector.
Although the expected growth in the Chinese economy is the weakest since 1976, the 2% figure is still stronger the growth expected in other major economies.
“We expect the economic recovery in the post-epidemic era to continue for several months. At the same time, deciding how to gradually withdraw the easing policies launched during the epidemic will require careful planning as uncertainties still exist inside and outside China,” Wang said.
However, challenges on the road to recovery remain. Rising numbers of COVID-19 cases and the re-imposition of lockdowns in some of China’s trading partners could put a dent in the demand for Chinese exports.

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 54.9 from October's 53.6, with the gauge staying well above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction for the seventh consecutive month.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the headline reading would slip to 53.5.
Since COVID-19 paralysed huge swathes of the economy early this year, China has seen a strong rebound in activity, helped by strict virus containment measures, infrastructure-driven stimulus, strong exports of medical supplies, and pent-up demand. 
Surging infections and fresh lockdowns in some of its key trading partners could dent demand for Chinese exports, which have been surprisingly resilient so far.
The Caixin PMI reading was the highest since November 2010, and comes after an official gauge of factory activity, focusing more on larger and state-owned firms, rose at the fastest pace in over three years.
E-commerce shopping promotions in November showed strong consumer demand, bolstering confidence for small and medium-sized firms.
Economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pick up in the industrial sector.
""Manufacturing continued to recover and the economy increasingly returned to normality as fallout from the domestic COVID-19 epidemic faded,"" Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, wrote in a note accompanying the survey release.

In response to the economic shock from COVID-19, the government rolled out three federally funded temporary programs for unemployment insurance (UI), expanding benefit eligibility to people who did not qualify for the regular state UI and enhancing benefits. 
The Labor Department's weekly jobless claims publishes the number of weeks of unemployment benefits claimed by individuals in each state during the period and reports the total as the number of people claiming benefits nationwide.
""DOL officials told GAO that they have traditionally used this number as a proxy for the number of individuals claiming benefits because they were closely related,"" the GAO said.
""However, the number of claims has not been an accurate estimate of the number of individuals claiming benefits during the pandemic because of backlogs in processing a historic volume of claims, among other data issues.""
Economists have complained about the accuracy of the data. In August, the Labor Department changed the methodology it uses to address seasonal fluctuations in the claims data.
The GAO recommended that the Labor Department revise its weekly news releases to ""clarify that in the current unemployment environment, the numbers it reports for weeks of unemployment claimed do not accurately estimate the number of unique individuals claiming benefits."" 
It also said the department should ""pursue options to report the actual number of distinct individuals claiming benefits, such as by collecting these already available data from states from January 2020."" 
The GAO said the department had partially agreed with the recommendations. It did not agree with the retroactive reporting of the data as this could pose challenges to state UI programs in implementing any new reporting requirements, especially retroactively.
""Without an accurate accounting of the number of individuals who are relying on these benefits in as close to real time as possible, policymakers may be challenged to respond to the crisis at hand,"" the GAO said.

Two government-funded UI programs will expire in December, affecting at least 13.6 million Americans.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes fell for a second straight month in October as an acute shortage of properties pushed up prices, though the housing market remains supported by record low mortgage rates.
Other data on Monday showed activity at factories in the Midwest and Texas slowing this month, likely as a nationwide resurgence in new COVID-19 infections curbed new orders and disrupted production. The reports support expectations of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter because of the raging coronavirus pandemic and depleted fiscal stimulus.
""Storm clouds are gathering,"" said George Ratiu, senior economist at realtor.com. ""This winter could pose an unusual challenge for many people across the country, unless Congress takes significant actions."" 
The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, decreased 1.1% to 128.9. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would rebound 1.0% in October.
Compared to a year ago, pending homes sales jumped 20.2% in October. The monthly decline in contracts suggests a slowdown in sales of existing home sales after they accelerated in October to their highest level since November 2005.
The housing market is being driven by record low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home, has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out more spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average 2.72%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
U.S. stocks were trading lower on Monday. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. 
The United States is in the grip of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with more than 4 million new cases and over 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported so far in November, according to a Reuters tally. 
The resurgence is happening at a time when more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief has lapsed. The fiscal stimulus helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. 
RISING LAYOFFS
Applications for unemployment benefits have increased for two straight weeks and about 13.6 million Americans will lose government-funded jobless benefits a day after Christmas. Another package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is consumed with contesting his electoral loss to Biden.
A second report on Monday showed the Chicago Business Barometer dropped to a reading of 58.2 in November from 61.1 in October. A reading above 50 in the index produced with MNI indicates expansion in factory activity in the Chicago area. The survey's new orders measure dropped for the first time since May, when the recovery from the pandemic started.
The moderation in factory activity was corroborated by another survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve showing its production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions in Texas, tumbled to a reading of 7.2 this month from 25.5 in October. Factories in the region reported a significant slowdown in new orders, and were less upbeat about the outlook. 
The surveys, together with reports earlier this month showing a cooling in activity in factories in New York and the mid-Atlantic region, suggest national manufacturing moderated in November after accelerating in October. 
The Institute for Supply Management is scheduled to publish its November survey on Tuesday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the ISM national manufacturing index likely fell to a reading of 58.0 from 59.3 in October.
""The manufacturing sector is continuing to recover but remains below pre-pandemic levels,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. ""The threat now comes from virus outbreaks that could interrupt activity, disrupt supply chains and weigh on demand.""
Robust demand for housing has outstripped supply, boosting home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. The government reported this month that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, raced to the highest level since April 2007.
Though homebuilder confidence is at historic highs, builders have complained about shortages of land and materials.
In October, pending home sales edged up 0.1% in the South. They were unchanged in the West. Contracts dropped 5.9% in the Northeast and fell 0.7% in the Midwest.

""We expect a resurging pandemic, faltering recovery, and depleted inventories to weigh on home sales, particularly if no additional fiscal stimulus is forthcoming,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Consumer prices, harmonised to make them comparable with inflation data from other European Union countries, fell 0.7% year-on-year after shrinking by 0.5% in the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office said.
November's preliminary data compared with a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.5% decline.
""The inflation rate is influenced, among other things, by the reduction in value-added tax that came into force on July 1, 2020,"" the office said in a statement.
On the month, harmonised prices fell 1.0%. The Reuters consensus forecast was a fall of 0.8%.
The European Central Bank, which has a target of keeping inflation close to but below 2% in the euro zone, is preparing a new stimulus package to help cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The ECB's chief economist warned last Thursday that accepting ""a longer phase of even lower inflation"" would hurt consumption and investment as well as cementing expectations of low price growth in the future.
The euro zone's central bank has kept the money taps wide open for years and promised to announce further stimulus, probably in the form of even more bond purchases and subsidised loans to banks, at its Dec. 10 meeting.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lenders approved the most mortgages in more than 13 years in October, Bank of England data showed on Monday, suggesting no let-up yet in a post-coronavirus lockdown bounce-back in the country's housing market.
But the figures also underscored a broader wariness about day-to-day borrowing among many consumers - whose spending helps drive the economy - as the country was hit by a second wave of COVID-19 cases.
Mortgage approvals for house purchase hit 97,532, up from 92,091 in September and higher than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Britain's housing market has gone into top gear in recent months, propelled by demand for bigger properties from people who were locked down at home in the spring and an emergency tax cut for buyers that is due to expire in March.
The housing recovery looks increasingly at odds with a renewed slowdown in the economy and a rise in unemployment that looks set to peak only next year.
The BoE data showed net consumer lending fell by 590 million pounds ($786 million) on the month, much of it due to repayment of credit card debt.
Lending to consumers was down 5.6% compared with a year ago, the biggest such drop since monthly records began in 1994.
Household savings rose by 12.3 billion pounds, the biggest monthly increase since May.
""A reduction in the use of consumer credit and another increase in savings suggests many are bracing themselves for further economic uncertainty,"" Alistair McQueen, head of savings and retirement at insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV), said.

The increase in mortgages came after real estate agencies started getting enquiries on properties and visits again from June, following a near-standstill for the industry during nearly three months of pandemic lockdown.
Rural and coastal regions like Aragon and Asturias registered 78% and 76% more mortgages respectively year-on-year as people fled urban centres.

Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank's business barometer sank by 3 points to -21 for the month as a whole, hit by nervousness about Britain's chances of a post-Brexit trade deal as well as the pandemic measures.
But responses in the second week of the survey saw confidence rise by three points to -15, coinciding with the Nov. 9 announcement by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) about the effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at the fastest pace in more than three years in November, while growth in the services sector also hit a multi-year high, as the country's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic stepped up.
Upbeat data released on Monday suggests the world's second-largest economy is on track to become the first to completely shake off the drag from widespread industry shutdowns, with recent production data showing manufacturing now at pre-pandemic levels.
China's official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 52.1 in November from 51.4 in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. It was the highest PMI reading since September 2017 and remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. It was also higher than the 51.5 median forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
""The rise in November manufacturing PMI, with broad-based improvements across the sub-indices, suggest the recovery momentum in the industrial sector has become more certain,"" Zhang Liqun, analyst at China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing.
""But the results also showed inadequate demand is still a common issue facing firms. We need to consolidate the policy support aimed to expand domestic demand.""
China's blue-chip stock market index hit a 5-1/2 year high following the brisk data.
The robust headline PMI points to solid fourth-quarter growth, which analysts at Nomura expect to quicken to 5.7% year-on-year, from 4.9% in the third quarter, an impressive turnaround from the deep contraction earlier this year.
The economy is expected to expand around 2% for the full year, the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies that are struggling to bring their coronavirus outbreaks under control.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 51.5 in November, improving from 51.0 a month earlier. That bodes well for the export sector, which has benefited from strong foreign demand for medical supplies and electronics products.
Also helping activity in November were strong e-commerce shopping promotions, which unleashed solid consumer demand and bolstered confidence for small and medium firms.
But a surging yuan and further lockdowns in many of its key trading partners could pressure Chinese exports, which have been surprisingly resilient so far.
More companies have reported the impact from currency fluctuations, compared with a month ago, said Zhao Qinghe, senior statistician at the NBS.
""Some firms have flagged that as the yuan continues to rise, corporate profits are under pressure and export orders are declining,"" said Zhao. 
He added the recovery across the manufacturing industry remained uneven. For example, the PMI for the textile industry has stayed below the 50-point threshold, pointing to weak business activity.
CONSUMER COMEBACK
In the services sector, activity expanded for the ninth straight month. The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.4, the fastest since June 2012 and up from 56.2 in October, as consumer confidence gathered pace amid few COVID-19 infections. 
Railway and air transportation, telecommunication and satellite transmission services and the financial industry were among the best performing sectors in November.
A sub-index for construction activity stood at 60.5 in November, improving from 59.8 in October, as China steps up infrastructure spending to revive its economy. 
Monday's data also showed the labour market is still facing strains. Services firms reduced payrolls at a faster clip in November, data showed, while factories slashed staff for the seventh straight month, although at a slower pace. 

""The continued recovery reduces the need for further monetary easing, but any shift to tightening is also unlikely given continued labour market pressure,"" said Erin Xin, Greater China economist at HSBC.

Investing.com – Chinese factory activity grew at the fastest pace in more than three years in November, with the services sector also seeing its highest levels in years. The country continues a strong economic recovery, with manufacturing now at pre-COVID-19 levels. China is also poised to become the first to country to completely recover from the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown imposed earlier in the year.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) grew 52.1% in November, higher than the 51.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and October’s 51.4% reading. Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI also outperformed, growing 56.4% in November against the forecast 56% and October’s 56.2% figure.
“The rise in November’s manufacturing PMI, with broad-based improvements across the sub-indices, suggest the recovery momentum in the industrial sector has become more certain,” China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing analyst Zhang Liqun told Reuters.
“But the results also showed inadequate demand is still a common issue facing firms. We need to consolidate the policy support aimed to expand domestic demand,” Zhang added.
China currently leads the pack in economic recovery from COVID-19. The economy is expected to grow around 2% for the full year, its weakest level in over 30 years but still ahead of other major economies.
The growth in the manufacturing PMI indicates a bright future for exports, already the beneficiary of strong overseas demand for medical supplies and electronics products. E-commerce shopping promotions, primarily on Singles Day earlier in the month, also saw strong consumer demand and boosted small and medium firms’ confidence levels.
However, a strengthening yuan and trading partners such as Europe and the U.S. introducing fresh lockdowns to curb a second wave of COVID-19 cases, remain challenges to the recovery. More companies have reported the impact from currency fluctuations, compared with a month ago, NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe told Reuters.
“Some firms have flagged that as the yuan continues to rise, corporate profits are under pressure and export orders are declining.” Zhao warned, however, that recovery across the manufacturing industry remained uneven. The PMI for the textile industry stayed below the 50-mark indicating growth, for example.
Meanwhile, the services sector secured a ninth straight month of expansion, the fastest since June 2012, as fewer COVID-19 cases in China increased consumer confidence.
Some of the best performing sectors in November include railway and air transportation, telecommunication and satellite transmission services, and the financial industry.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose for the fifth straight month in October and retail sales in the same month grew the most in over a year, signalling the economy was recovering further from the damage caused by the COVID-19 crisis.
The world's third-largest economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter from a pandemic-induced slump, thanks to surging consumption and exports, though some analysts worry about slowing growth ahead due to a resurgence in coronavirus infections.
""There's a possibility China-bound exports and output will be sluggish if the United States gets worse, and that would spread to China,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research.
""But if there will be any impact, it'll be with a bit of a time lag,"" he said, adding that Japanese manufacturers could feel it most strongly in the first quarter of next year.
Official data released on Monday showed factory output jumped 3.8% in October from the previous month, mainly due to strength in general machinery production and motor vehicle manufacturing.
The solid increase beat the median market forecast of a 2.1% rise in a Reuters poll of economists, and was in line with the prior month's 3.9% gain.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expected output to grow another 2.7% in November and decline 2.4% in December.
""The overall figure was quite strong. (Output of) capital expenditure-related machinery such as general machinery production was picking up,"" Tsunoda said.
Inventories across all industries fell 1.6% in October, the seventh straight month of decline, as inventories of inorganic and organic chemicals as well as iron, steel and non-ferrous metals were reduced.
Separate data showed retail sales posted their largest gain since September last year in October year-on-year after consumers sharply curtailed spending in October 2019 following a sales tax hike at that time.
Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in October to rise for the first time in eight months, matching a 6.4% gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll and turning around from an 8.7% drop in the previous month.
Some analysts worry that the economic recovery will lose steam as a resurgence in coronavirus infections at home and abroad is expected to weigh on demand due to slowing corporate and consumer activity.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga instructed his cabinet earlier this month to compile a package of stimulus measures to speed up the country's economic recovery.
The package is expected to target structural changes, supporting environmental investment and boosting productivity through digitalisation.

Ruling party lawmakers have called for an extra budget worth around 20 trillion yen to 30 trillion yen ($192.05 billion to $288.07 billion), which will fund part of the stimulus package.

""The prospects for Christmas business in this coronavirus year are worryingly poor, especially for many inner-city retailers and especially the fashion houses,"" said HDE managing director Stefan Genth on Sunday.
Around 52% of companies expect significant losses in sales and customers after the extension of the country's partial lockdown into December, the survey found, with 62% of retailers surveyed pessimistic about the further course of Christmas business.
""November and December are normally the strongest months of the year in terms of sales for many retailers. If these sales are now lost, many businesses will be in trouble"".
The survey found that 38% of the retail companies overall and 45% of inner-city retailers see their existence threatened.
Retailers selling household goods, DIY supplies, furnishings and food, however, are reporting satisfactory to very good business, HDE said, while online sales are expected to rise by a third compared to the previous year.
Overall, the HDE retail association expects sales for November and December to rise by 1.2% this year to just under 104 billion euros ($124 billion).

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Loan defaults in Brazil fell to historic lows in October, figures showed on Friday, in further evidence of the economy's recovery and that the central bank's steps to loosen financial conditions were working.
Key measures of household and business loan defaults were their lowest since the central bank's data series began in 2011, although lending spreads widened slightly from the previous month's record lows.
A broad 90-day default ratio covering households and businesses fell to 3.1% in October from 3.2% in September, the central bank said, the lowest since the bank's data series began in 2011.
(Graphic: Brazil loan defaults https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopadrqrva/DEFAULTS.png)
The default ratio for non-financial companies fell to a record low 1.5% from 1.6%, while the broad measure of household defaults, including borrowing such as auto loans and overdrafts, also fell to a series low of 4.5% from 4.6% the month before.
Lending spreads, however, widened to 21.5 percentage points from September's record low 21.2 percentage points, the central bank said. That was still significantly down from 29 percentage points in February before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The central bank has made available more than 1.2 trillion reais worth of credit and liquidity to businesses, banks and financial markets to cushion the economic shock of COVID-19.
Central bank president Roberto Campos Neto said this week that these measures are ""here to stay"", although they will be modified. Their implementation marks a ""structural change"", he said.
The government has also provided direct cash transfers to tens of millions of Brazil's poorest people. These measures appear to have helped revive lending and economic activity, and stave off loan defaults.
The stock of outstanding loans in Brazil rose 1.4% in October to 3.9 trillion reais ($730.3 billion), the central bank said. Corporate loans rose 1% on the month to 1.7 trillion reais, and personal loans increased 1.7% to 2.2 trillion reais.
Loan growth over the last 12 months accelerated 14.5%, the central bank said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's unemployment rate rose to a record high 14.6% in the three months to September, official figures showed on Friday, as the easing of COVID-19 social distancing and lockdown measures encouraged people to look for work again.
That was up from 14.4% in the three months to August, although it was lower than the 14.9% economists had expected. The unemployment rate at the end of last year was 11.0%.
The headline 14.6% unemployment rate was the highest since statistics agency IBGE's series began in 2012.
Underlying figures were also weak despite other data recently that showed record formal job growth and the economy continuing to rebound.
The number of Brazilians out of the workforce completely and the underemployment rate remained near record highs, while the number of people with jobs and the share of the working population in work remained near record lows, IBGE said.
The workforce of 96.5 million people was 1 million higher than the three months through August, but still 9.8 million or 9.2% smaller than the same period last year, IBGE said.
The number of people in work was 82.5 million, down 12.1%, or 11.3 million people, from the same period last year.
Only 47.1% of working-age people were working in the three months to September, IBGE said, down 7.7 percentage points from the same period last year.
Some 78.6 million people were out of the workforce completely, down slightly from the three months to August but up 21.2%, or 13.7 million people, from the same period last year, IBGE said.
The number of Brazilians officially out of work rose to 14.1 million, and the number of underemployed was 33.2 million, IBGE said. The underemployment rate was 30.3%.

Figures on Thursday showed that a record net 395,000 formal jobs were created in October. The dominant services sector, which had been hardest hit by social distancing measures, led the charge with a net 157,000 new jobs.

The survey is typically conducted in the first two to three weeks of the month, meaning they relate to the mood after a series of lockdowns were announced, including in the euro zone's two largest economies, Germany and France.
""After the partial recovery of sentiment between May and September and the broad sideways movement in October, the drop is the first one since sentiment fell sharply in the first COVID-19 wave,"" the European Commission said in its report.
The decline of sentiment, it said, was fuelled by diving confidence in retail, services and among consumers. Sentiment in industry and construction, which have been largely spared in lockdowns, suffered only mild declines.
In all cases, the view of future business worsened.
Sentiment in services, the euro zone economy's biggest sector producing some two thirds of gross domestic product, slipped to -17.3 from -12.1. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a fall to -15.5 points.
Sentiment among consumers fell to -17.6 in November from -15.5 points in October, in line with the flash estimate released last week.
The mood in industry dropped to -10.1 from -9.2, just above expectations of a fall to -10.5.
Inflation expectations in industry declined to 0.2 points from 0.7 but rose among consumers to 15.4 points from 13.3 in October. Both were below the average values since 2000.

The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) is expected to rise slightly to 51.5 in November from October's 51.4, according to the median forecast of 22 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity on a monthly basis.
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy early this year. Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday he expects economic activity to return to a reasonable range next year.
Profits at industrial firms grew in October for a sixth consecutive month and at their quickest pace since early 2017, data showed on Friday.
""Overall, we believe China's economic recovery remains largely on track and maintain our real GDP growth forecast of 5.7% y-o-y for Q4, up from 4.9% in Q3. We firmly believe Beijing will maintain its policy stance,"" analysts at Nomura said in a note on Friday. 
The Chinese economy is expected to expand around 2% for the full year - the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies which are still battling to contain virus infections.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its sister survey on the services sector, will both be released on Nov. 30.
The private Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Dec. 1. Analysts expect that headline reading will dip to 53.5 from a near decade high of 53.6 in October. 

The Caixin services PMI survey will be out on Dec. 3.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output probably grew for a fifth straight month in October and retail sales likely rebounded for the first time in eight months, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, offering further signs that the economy is gradually recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, a recent sharp jump in coronavirus cases is clouding the outlook, and expected softness in the job market and declining housing starts indicate a weakening of household purchasing power amid the health crisis.
""Although the economy is picking up, it remains way below the pre-pandemic level,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""As sales declines are prolonged, companies are laying off workers.""
Trade ministry data out Monday is expected to show industrial output rose 2.1% month-on-month in October, up for the fifth straight month but slowing from the prior month's 3.9% rise, the poll of 17 economists showed.
Separate data is likely to show retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in October, the first gain in eight months and reversing from the prior month's 8.7% drop, the poll found.
Internal affairs ministry data is expected to show the seasonally adjusted jobless rate edged up to 3.1% in October from the previous month's 3.0%, in a worrying sign for job losses caused by the pandemic, the poll found.

Investing.com – Chinese industrial firms’ profits rose to CNY642.91 billion ($97.78 billion) in October, reflecting the manufacturing sector’s steady recovery from the impact of COVID-19.
Data released earlier in the day from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed a 28.20% increase in Chinese industrial profit year-on-year, a sixth straight month of growth. Profits rose by 10.10% in September.
Profits also rose 0.7% for the year-to-date, up from September’s 2.4% contraction.
Strong exports have driven an impressive recovery in the industrial sector from the lockdown imposed earlier in the year as COVID-19 cases spread. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday that “we expect China’s economy will return to the proper range of development next year.”
“China’s macro policies will remain stable, effective, and sustainable,” Li added.
NBS accredited the growth to a low base in the same period last year and an increase in investment income in November. However, NBS economist Zhu Hong warned that profits could come under pressure going forward.
“We should note that the growth rate of industrial enterprises’ accounts receivable has risen, and the pressure on cash flow has increased, which bodes ill for the continuous recovery of companies’ production and operation,” Zhu said in a statement.
Other investors agreed.
“Looking ahead, we expect profits to remain strong in the coming quarter or two, though the pace of growth may slow. The recovery in household consumption and strong export performance should remain supportive, countering downward pressure from deflation in producer prices,” Bloomberg China economist David Qu told Bloomberg."

Profits at Chinese industrial firms surged 28.2% year-on-year in October to 642.91 billion yuan ($97.79 billion), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Friday, after rising 10.1% in September versus the previous year.
That was the biggest monthly profit growth since Jan-Feb 2017. The NBS combines the results for January and February to exclude distortions caused by the week-long Lunar New Year.
Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the NBS, said the sharp jump was helped by rising investment income. It also came from a low base in October 2019, Zhu said. 
China's industrial sector has seen an impressive recovery from the coronavirus fallout, helped by resilient demand for the country's exports. Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday he expects Chinese economic activity to return to a reasonable range next year.
For the January-October period, industrial firms' profits rose 0.7% on an annual basis, after falling 2.4% in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period last year. 
That growth was driven by the equipment manufacturing and the electronic sectors, while the auto manufacturing sector also saw a steady recovery in profits, Zhu said in a statement.
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.8% on-year at end-October, versus a 6.6% growth as of end-September.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 7.5% on an annual basis for the first ten months, compared with a 14.3% on-year decline in the January-September period, the statistics bureau data showed.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Formal job creation in Brazil surged to a record high in October, figures showed on Thursday, as the dominant services sector roared back to life to account for around 40% of new jobs.
A net 394,989 formal jobs were created in October, the economy ministry said, marking the fourth month in a row of gains and significantly more than the 233,500 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
The economy ministry chart below shows the scale of job growth in October compared with the same month in previous years.
Graphic: Brazil formal job growth - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovadzagpa/caged.png 
That reduced the net number of formal job losses in the first 10 months of this year to 171,139, the ministry said, also significantly less than 2015 and 2016 when Brazil was last in recession.
Hailing the record figures, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said that Brazil could end this year not having lost any formal jobs at all as the economic rebound in the second half of the year claws back most of the jobs lost in the first half.
""In this recession ... we didn't lose focus, we got back up, and we are creating jobs at a rapid pace. We can get to the end of the year with zero formal jobs lost. Zero,"" Guedes said, adding that this woulds represent a ""historic year for the Brazilian economy."" 
In October, 1.55 million jobs were created and 1.15 million were cut, the ministry said. Services led the way with a net 156,766 new jobs, followed by trade (115,646) and industry (86,426).
In the first 10 months of 2015 and 2016, a net 818,918 and 751,816 jobs had been lost, respectively, economy ministry figures showed.
The figures also showed that the formal labor market in October consisted of 38.6 million workers, the highest since March this year as discouraged workers returned to look for work.

Official labor market data for the three months to September will be released next week. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to a new series high of 14.9% from 14.4%.

LONDON (Reuters) - The proportion of British workers on furlough has jumped to its highest level since late June following the introduction of a temporary four-week lockdown across England to reverse a second wave of COVID cases, official figures showed on Thursday.
Businesses reported that 15% of staff on average were on furlough between Nov. 2 and Nov. 15, up from 9% in the previous survey which covered the second half of October, the Office for National Statistics said.
Britain's government placed England under a four-week lockdown which started on Nov. 5 which closed restaurants, pubs, non-essential retailers and most other businesses open to the public.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak had intended to terminate the furlough programme at the end of October, but the second wave of COVID cases forced him to extend it until the end of March.
At its peak in May, the programme supported 8.9 million jobs - almost a third of all employees - and it has been the single most expensive part of Britain's COVID economic support programme, costing 43 billion pounds ($57 billion) so far.
On Wednesday, the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast that take-up in November would rise to 21% of the workforce due to lockdowns in England and other parts of the United Kingdom, before declining to 12% in early 2021 as restrictions eased.
Without the programme, Britain would see a significantly bigger rise in unemployment than the peak of 7.5% pencilled in for next year, the OBR said.

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - French and German consumer confidence plunged in November as new coronavirus restrictions crushed any prospect of a quick return to normal in the euro zone's two biggest economies, data published on Thursday showed.
Restaurants, bars, hotels and entertainment venues have had to shutter up this month in both countries under new restrictions to contain a new wave of COVID-19 infections.
While retail shops have remained open in Germany, non-essential stores had to close in France. They will be able to reopen on Saturday under strict sanitary protocols.
The latest restrictions leave household demand pent-up heading into the holiday season, pushing back prospects for a consumer-led economic recovery into next year.
In France, which was put back under one the strictest lockdowns in Europe on Oct. 30, consumer confidence fell this month to its lowest level since December 2018, surpassing levels reached in March and April during a first and even harsher lockdown.
France's official stats agency, INSEE, said its consumer confidence index fell four points to 90, worse than the average expectation in a Reuters poll of economists for 92.
Confidence was the lowest since the outbreak of violent street protests against the government during the ""yellow vest"" movement, which forced many shops to board up in central Paris.
Households felt more uncertain about their financial prospects, as concern about future unemployment reached its highest level since mid-2013.
Intentions to make major purchases fell while the number of people who said it was a good time to save kept climbing and sits well above its long-term average, the data showed.
In Germany, consumer morale fell further heading into December as a partial lockdown hit households' income expectations and their willingness to buy, a survey showed.
The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, dropped to -6.7 in November from a revised -3.2 in the previous month. The reading missed a Reuters forecast for a narrower drop to -5.0.
GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said although retail shops remained open so far, the shutdown of restaurants, bars, hotels and entertainment venues since Nov. 2 clouded consumers' mood. Rising cases of COVID-19 are increasing uncertainty, so Germans are holding onto their money, Buerkl added.
""The hopes for a rapid recovery that arose in early summer have definitely been dashed,"" Buerkl said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with leaders of Germany's 16 federal states late on Wednesday to extend and tighten the coronavirus lockdown until Dec. 20, but ease rules over the Christmas holidays to let families and friends celebrate together.
On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron said France would start gradually easing its lockdown this weekend, though many restrictions will remain.

But some epidemiologists say France may not return to a normal way of life until next autumn, provided that vaccine programmes work.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand recorded its first 1,201 foreign tourists in October since a ban in April aimed at averting coronavirus outbreaks, as the country gradually opens up to a select number of visitors to help its struggling, tourism-reliant economy.
Southeast Asia's second-largest economy contracted 6.4% in the third quarter from a year earlier after the second quarter's 12.1% slump as most virus restrictions were eased, but an absence of tourists is limiting the recovery.
The 1,201 foreign visitors in October is a fraction of the 3.07 million arrivals in the same month last year.
Tourism ministry data showed the latest visitors included 471 from China, 231 from neighbouring Cambodia, 178 from Middle East countries and 116 from Europe, all travelling on special 90-day visas that require two weeks of quarantine.
Thailand's entry restrictions have helped keep its coronavirus case tally to less than 4,000. 
It plans to restart talks with China on a travel bubble to boost an economy the government predicts will shrink by 6% this year.
But the country has yet to agree any such arrangements and previous plans were abandoned in August after coronavirus cases in Asia increased.
New outbreaks have seen several other travel bubbles between Asia-Pacific countries aborted or fail to take off, including between New Zealand and Australia, and Hong Kong and Singapore.
In January-October 2020, the number of foreign tourists in Thailand dropped 79.5% to 6.69 million - there were zero tourists recorded in April-September.
The state planning agency has forecast 6.7 million foreign tourists this year after last year's revised record 39.9 million visitors who spent 1.91 trillion baht ($63 billion), or about 11.3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
It predicts only 5 million foreign visitors in 2021.

That’s the outlook from the latest aggregate index combining eight early indicators tracked by Bloomberg, which was unchanged from October.
The data indicates China remains well on track to be the only major economy likely to expand this year. With the pandemic under control and consumer spending picking up, authorities are turning their focus to longer-term growth objectives and discussing withdrawing the emergency stimulus injected into the economy earlier this year.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
“China’s recovery extended into 4Q, though with a marginal loss of momentum. Investment and exports remained robust. But production growth showed signs of plateauing, and consumption picked up less than expected - even with a boost from a longer-than-usual golden week holiday.”
-- Chang Shu and David Qu, China economists
For the full report, click here.
Housing investment and purchases have rebounded strongly this year after initially falling in the wake of the outbreak of Covid-19 in central China. The value of home sales were flat in the first three weeks of November after rising 8.2% this year through the end of October and helping propel investment and construction.
That recovery is one factor driving metals demand, with the prices of iron ore, copper, and aluminum all hitting multi-year highs. The steady economic growth and good news on vaccines have also boosted stocks, with the main share index closing higher than 5,000 points for the first time in five years this week.
Chinese exports have been one of the driving forces of the economic rebound this year, expanding for the past five months as demand boomed for protective health gear and work-from-home electronics. South Korean exports, which is a leading indicator for Asian and global trade, rose 11% in the first 20 days of November, indicating solid demand for technology products.
Increasing export orders helped smaller companies too, with an index measuring business confidence rising in November.
“Demand remained buoyant, thanks in part to the increase in export orders -- this prompted an acceleration in production activity,” Shen Lan and Ding Shuang, economists at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which compiles the survey of more than 500 small and medium-sized companies in China, wrote in a note.
“Production and sales are expected to remain resilient for the rest of this year,” although services are still more affected by the lingering effects of the Covid-19 outbreak, they wrote.
Even with the rebound, there seems to be no end in sight for factory deflation. Producer prices fell 1.3% in November, according to Bloomberg’s tracker, an improvement from October’s official reading of a 2.1% drop, but still far away from the inflation needed to boost company profits.
Consumer prices could also turn negative in coming months, which would “weigh on corporate profits -- with potential negative implications for employment and debt repayment capacity,” according to Bloomberg Economics’s David Qu.
Early Indicators
From July, Bloomberg has changed some of the components for the early look at China’s economy, adding home sales in the biggest four cities, weekly car sales and inventories of steel reinforcing, while removing iron-ore prices, sales manager sentiment and property-related stocks.
Bloomberg Economics generates the overall activity reading by aggregating a three-month weighted average of the monthly changes of eight indicators, which are based on business surveys or market prices.

1171,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 04:01PM ET</span>","Fed Mulls Tweak of Asset Purchases to Keep Recovery Intact, Minutes Show","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers mulled a range of options to tweak their bond-buying program, and agreed that while the current pace of purchases was appropriate and an update on guidance was needed ""fairly soon,"" according to the minutes of the central bank's last policy meeting released Wednesday.
At the conclusion of its previous meeting on Nov. 5, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate in a range of  0% to 0.25% and pledged to maintain bond purchases at a $120 billion monthly pace.
Fed members debated a range of options on bond purchases to support the recovery, including increasing the pace of purchases or shifting focus to longer duration bonds.      
""Participants generally saw the current pace and composition as effective ... and noted the committee ""could provide more accommodation, if appropriate, by increasing the pace of purchases or by shifting its Treasury purchases to those with a longer maturity without increasing the size of its purchases,"" the minutes showed.
The Fed's bond purchases so far, have lowered longer term borrowing costs for businesses and households, and continue to help steer the economy through the pandemic.  
In recent weeks, the sense of urgency to widen the liquidity spigot has been strengthened after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he would allow the central bank's emergency lending programs – rolled out at the height of pandemic in March – to expire at year-end.
""The unilateral decision of Treasury Secretary Mnuchin to allow a slew of Fed emergency lending programs to close to new borrowers on December 31, despite Fed objections, increases the chance that the FOMC will step-up its asset purchases,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note.
The decision from Mnuchin was widely criticized as it comes as a time when another wave of coronavirus cases across the nation has seen parts of the U.S. impose lockdown measures that will slow the recovery.
Most members, however, appear keen to avoid the 'taper tantrum' seen in previous years - when expectations for the central bank to trim its bond purchases triggered a bout volatility in markets - and prefer the Fed to beef up its guidance on bond purchases.
“Many participants judged that the Committee might want to enhance its guidance for asset purchases fairly soon,” the minutes said. ""Most participants judged that the guidance for asset purchases should imply that increases in the Committee's securities holdings would taper and cease sometime before the Committee would begin to raise the target range for the federal funds rate."" 
The lower interest rate environment has allowed the economy to pick up the economic slack, which in turn is expected to ""cause inflation to increase gradually,"" with the fed predicting a moderate 2% overshoot for some time in the years beyond 2023. 
While Fed members agreed the future path of fiscal policy support remained uncertain, hopes for a helping fiscal hand were given a boost on reports that President-elect Joe Biden will nominate former Fed Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary.
During her tenure as Fed Chair, Yellen was viewed as pro-stimulus, and if nominated is widely expected to support fiscal-boosting measures.
Treasury secretaries, however, don’t have direct control over fiscal policy. The former Fed Chair will likely have to contend with a Republican-held Senate that could keep fiscal policy options on a short leash somewhat."
1172,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","Slowing U.S. labor market, rising COVID-19 cases cast cloud over economic recovery","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits increased further last week, suggesting that an explosion in new COVID-19 infections and business restrictions were boosting layoffs and undermining the labor market recovery.
Still, the economy got off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, with consumer spending and business investment in equipment topping analysts' expectations in October. Businesses also reported a sharp rebound in profits in the third quarter.
But that is probably insufficient to lift the heavy cloud over the economy. Personal income dropped last month and could decline further with at least 12 million Americans due to lose government-funded unemployment benefits a day after Christmas. 
The benefits, part of a more than $3 trillion government coronavirus relief package which has largely expired, helped contribute to record economic growth in the third quarter. Another package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is heavily focused on contesting his electoral loss to Biden. 
""There is a two-tier recovery from the pandemic recession where the top of society continues to spend as normal while the bottom-half of the country sits in long lines at food banks with the opportunities for employment few and far between,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 30,000 to a seasonally adjusted 778,000 for the week ended Nov. 21, the Labor Department said. That was the second straight weekly increase in claims and exceeded economists' expectations for 730,000 applications in a Reuters poll.
The weekly claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, was published a day early because of Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday. 
Unadjusted claims jumped 78,372 to 827,710 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.14 million people filed claims last week. There were at least 20.5 million people collecting unemployment benefits in early November.
The United States has been slammed by a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, with daily cases exceeding 100,000 since early November. More than 12 million people have been infected in the country, according to a Reuters tally of official data.
The respiratory illness has killed more than 259,000 Americans and hospitalizations are soaring, prompting state and local governments to reimpose a host of restrictions on social and economic life in recent weeks, which could keep claims above their 665,000 peak seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
EXHAUSTING BENEFITS
Though the claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 299,000 to 6.071 million in the week ending Nov. 14, that was because many have exhausted their eligibility, which is limited to six months in most states. 
A record 4.509 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Nov. 7, up 132,437 from the prior week. These benefits as well as those for gig workers and the self-employed will lapse on Dec. 26. 
That and the ebb in consumer confidence amid the raging pandemic cast doubts on the sustainability of the strong pace of spending. In second report, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.5% last month after increasing 1.2% in September. But personal income fell 0.7%, reversing a 0.7% gain in September. Economists had forecast consumer spending rising 0.4%.
""Were it not for recent virus-related developments, it looks like GDP would be on track for a pretty robust fourth quarter,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York. ""But given the recent surge in new COVID-19 cases, we think that the data will soften noticeably in November and December."" 
The anticipated slowdown in consumer spending is likely to be blunted somewhat by solid business investment against the backdrop of robust profits, ensuring the economy continues to grow in the fourth quarter, though at a moderate pace. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans rose 0.7% in October, the Commerce Department said in a third report.
A fourth report from the department showed after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, rebounded at a 36.6% annualized rate in the third quarter after two straight quarterly declines. 
The department also confirmed that the economy grew at a historic 33.1% pace in the July-September quarter. 
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% annualized rate. Slower growth was underscored by a fifth report from the Commerce Department showing the goods trade deficit increased 1.2% to $80.3 billion in October. 

Despite encouraging developments on vaccines, spiraling COVID-19 infections and expectations for a smaller stimulus package have prompted economists to sharply downgrade their GDP growth forecasts for the first quarter of 2021.

LONDON (Reuters) - Failure by Britain and the European Union to agree a free trade deal would wipe an extra 2% off the United Kingdom's economic output while driving up inflation, unemployment and public borrowing, official forecasts showed on Wednesday. 
The Office for Budget Responsibility revisited its Brexit forecasts after deciding the prospect of a ""no deal"" exit remained a risk, just over five weeks before Britain fully leaves the world's biggest trading bloc on Dec. 31.
The OBR said the imposition of tariffs under World Trade Organization rules and disruption at borders would hit parts of the economy such as manufacturing that were emerging relatively unscathed from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The independent body had already forecast Brexit would cost Britain 4% of GDP in the long run even if Britain secures a free trade agreement with the EU, compared to it staying in the bloc.
""This (no deal) would further reduce output by 2% initially and 1.5% at the forecast horizon,"" it said.
The initial economic hit would be felt at the start of the following year, and the OBR predicted little of the lost output would be recovered over the next five years.
Unemployment, at 4.8% in the third quarter of 2020, could peak at 8.3% in the third quarter of 2021 if there is no deal -- 0.9 percentage points higher than in its central forecast for that period.
Consumer prices could rise by 1.5% above the OBR's central forecast, and lower tax receipts and higher spending on welfare and other measures could mean borrowing is higher by 10 billion pounds ($13.38 billion) a year on average from 2021-22 onwards, pushing up debt. 

""The imposition of tariffs on EU imports, higher non-tariff barriers, and a drop in the exchange rate all raise consumer prices, leaving them 1.5% higher by the forecast horizon than in our central forecast,"" the OBR said.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 25, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",U.S. core capital goods orders beat expectations in October,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in October, but momentum is slowing in line with expectations for slower economic growth in the fourth quarter.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.7% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders surged 1.9% in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.5%. Core capital goods orders rose 0.2% year-on-year in October.
Orders last month were supported by demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components, computers and electronic products, primary metals and fabricated metal products. But orders for machinery fell.
Shipments of core capital goods jumped 2.3% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They rose 0.7% in September. 
Business investment on equipment rebounded strongly in the third quarter after five straight quarterly declines. Economists expect slower economic growth after a historic pace of expansion in the third quarter. 
The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% rate. 
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, increased 1.3% in October after racing up 2.1% in September. 

Durable goods orders were lifted by a 1.2% increase in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 3.3% jump in September. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell 3.2%. Orders for civilian aircraft increased 38.8%. There had been no civilian aircraft orders for three straight months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government cut its view on capital spending in November for the fifth time this year as companies trimmed investment, and said overall economic conditions were still severe due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The world's third-largest economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter from the COVID-19 hit, largely thanks to stronger consumption and exports, but a resurgence in infections at home and abroad is weighing on the outlook.
""The Japanese economy remains in a severe situation due to the novel coronavirus, but it is showing signs of picking up,"" the government said in its November economic report.
The government said the impact from policy measures at home and improvement in activity overseas supported hopes for a continued rebound in the economy.
But it also warned ""full attention"" should be given to further risks from the pandemic, at home and abroad.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned that any increase in coronavirus infections could weigh on consumer sentiment and overseas economies, posing a downside risk to consumption as well as exports and output.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga instructed his cabinet earlier this month to compile a package of stimulus measures to cushion the blow from the pandemic and push forward structural changes in the economy.
""We want to put together measures while carefully watching the (coronavirus) impact, especially on regional economies and everyone working in the tourism sector,"" Nishimura said.
Among key economic elements, the government said business expenditure has been decreasing, slashing its assessment of the component for the sixth time since last upgrading it in September 2018.
Japan has seen relatively low capital spending growth compared to other major countries over the past 15 years, which is a reflection of the expected growth rate of the domestic market, the official said.
Japan needs solid capital spending to offset risks to its export-reliant economy from abroad.
The government upgraded its view on output, saying it was picking up due largely to solid car and transport equipment production.
It left unchanged its assessment of the other remaining components in the report, such as exports and employment conditions.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's balance of payments position with the rest of the world improved in October, figures showed on Wednesday, as a $1.5 billion current account surplus helped narrow the 12-month accumulated deficit to its smallest in two and a half years.
A widening surplus in goods trade, and shrinking deficits in services and primary income again delivered the overall current account surplus, the central bank said, adding that it forecasts a surplus of $1 billion for November.
Revisions to previous months meant that Brazil posted a tiny current account deficit of $10.8 million in June, breaking what would have been a run of seven consecutive surpluses, something not seen since 2006.
October's surplus was more than the $1.3 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, and narrowed the overall deficit in the preceding 12 months to 1% of gross domestic product, the smallest since February 2018.
Goods exports fell 8.6% from the same month last year to $18 billion, the central bank said, while imports fell 26.3% to $13.1 billion, giving a trade surplus of 4.9 billion. So far this year, exports have fallen 7.8% and imports have slumped 15.1%.
The services deficit shrank by 55.2% from a year earlier to $1.6 billion and the primary income deficit shrank by 70.6% to $1.9 billion, the central bank said.
The current account deficit in the first 10 months of the year stood at $7.6 billion.
Foreign direct investment totaled $1.8 billion in October, sharply down from $8.2 billion a year ago, the central bank said, adding that it forecasts FDI of $1 billion in November.
On the portfolio side, Brazil posted an overall net inflow of $5.5 billion into domestic stocks and bonds last month, comprised of $2.8 billion into stocks and $2.7 billion into bonds.

Inflows have returned in recent months, but so far this year a net $21.6 billion has been pulled from domestic markets, the central bank said, and $27.4 billion has been pulled in the last 12 months.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits in the United States rose for a second straight week last week, further exposing the extent of the economy's slowdown as the Covid-19 virus ravages the country again. 
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims rose to 778,000, well in excess of the 730,000 expected by analysts ahead of time. The previous week's number was also revised up by 6,000 to 748,000. Last week had been the first rise in initial claims for over a month. 
Continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag, fell to a new post-pandemic low of 6.07 million, but this was slightly less than the drop expected.
The figures come at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is running more or less unchecked through much of the U.S., with the number of new infections running at around 170,000 a day over the last week. An average of 1,500 people have died of the disease every day during that time. The number of those hospitalized has leaped to a record 86,000, nearly tripling since the start of October.
The developments have forced the closure of more and more of the country's hospitality sector and other businesses considered non-essential, as state governors try to stop their hospitals from being overwhelmed.
U.S. stock futures were little changed after the news. By 8:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the S&P 500 Futures contract was effectively flat, after hitting a new record high along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday. Markets have increasingly focused on the prospects for a vigorous economic recovery next year in recent days, as three separate pharma companies declared they had an developed effective vaccines against Covid-19.
Additionally, reports that President-elect Joe Biden will nominate Janet Yellen to be his Treasury Secretary have fostered hopes of a big fiscal stimulus package next year - if it can get past a Senate that it still in the hands of the Republican Party.
There was better news from the Commerce Department, which said that durable goods orders had risen 1.3% in October, more than expected. September's rise in orders was also revised higher. However, it left its estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product unchanged at an annualized 33.1%."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Consumer confidence in Brazil fell in November for the second month in a row, a survey showed on Wednesday, reflecting growing concern over the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, and the looming end of emergency government income transfers.
Government officials have trumpeted the economy's 'V-shaped' rebound from the depths of recession earlier this year and are bullish on next year, which they say could see the economy growing by 4% or even more.
But the Getulio Vargas Foundation's (FGV) consumer confidence index for November suggests consumers are becoming increasingly cautious, with government support due to expire on Dec. 31 and signs the pandemic is creeping back.
The index fell 0.7 points to 81.7 points in November, a second straight decline following a run of five increases from April's record low 58.2, and slipping further back from the pre-pandemic level of 87.8 in February.
(Graphic: Brazil consumer confidence https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlaknwpb/CONSCONF.png)
""With the probable end of the period of emergency benefits, many consumers who lost their jobs this year are expected to return to the job market at a time when companies will still be postponing hiring or firing, especially in the event of a second wave of COVID-19,"" said FGV survey manager Viviane Seda Bittencourt.
Confidence about conditions fell 0.6 points to 71.8, and future expectations fell 0.9 points to 89.3, FGV said.
The economic expectations sub-index fell 3.8 points to 106.8, the biggest driver of the overall decline in future expectations, FGV said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell more than expected in November amid a widespread resurgence in new COVID-19 infections and business restrictions, reinforcing expectations for a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter.
The survey from the Conference Board on Tuesday followed on the heels of reports this month showing a moderation in job growth and retail sales in October. The number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased in mid-November.
The economy is losing speed as more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief has lapsed. The fiscal stimulus helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and small-to-medium sized companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter.
Another rescue package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is heavily focused on contesting his electoral loss to Biden. Daily new coronavirus cases in the United States have exceeded 100,000 since early November, according to a Reuters tally. 
The consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 96.1 this month from 101.4 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index falling to a reading of 98 in November. The index was at 132.6 in February.
The cut-off date for the survey was November 13, before more encouraging news on vaccines for the respiratory illness.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, slipped to a reading of 105.9. from 106.2 in October. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions fell to 89.5 from a reading of 98.2 in October.
""Heading into 2021, consumers do not foresee the economy, nor the labor market, gaining strength,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. ""In addition, the resurgence of COVID-19 is further increasing uncertainty and exacerbating concerns about the outlook.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as the formal go-ahead for Biden's transition to the White House ended weeks of political uncertainty. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, edged up to a reading of 7.2 this month from 7.1 in October. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It was as high as 38.3 in August last year.
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income was unchanged at 17.6% this month and the proportion anticipating a drop fell to 13.3% from 14.2% last month.
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.
Despite consumer trepidation about the future, the housing market continues to boom. The pandemic has fueled a migration from city centers to suburbs and other lower-density areas as Americans seek more space for home offices and schooling. 

A separate report on Tuesday showed the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-metro-area house price index jumped 6.6% from a year ago in September after rising 5.3% in August.

INSEE, the official stats agency, said its monthly business climate index fell to 79 from 92 in October, the lowest reading since June, when France was still emerging from its first lockdown.
French President Emmanuel Macron is due to announce on Tuesday evening a relaxation of the second lockdown following a decline in new case numbers since it was imposed on Oct. 30.
Less stringent than the first lockdown, the latest restrictions have hurt the euro zone's second-biggest economy less, high-frequency data ranging from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) user location history to electricity demand suggest. 
Nonetheless, the dominant service sector has suffered, bearing the brunt of the economic fallout. Already struggling restaurants, hotels and non-essential were forced to shut down for the second time this year.
INSEE's business climate index for services fell to 77 in November from 89 in October, also hitting the lowest level since June.

With factories able to keep operating despite the lockdown, manufacturing fared much better. Its index fell only to 92 from 94 last month, better than economists' average forecast for 91 in a Reuters poll.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global executives see a smaller hit to their investment plans for Europe than they did earlier this year and are somewhat more upbeat about the continent's future appeal, a questionnaire by professional services group EY found.
The survey, conducted in October before a series of COVID-19 vaccine trial breakthroughs, showed that 42% of executives now expect a decrease in their 2020 investment plans and 31% plan to delay them to 2021.
That compared with 66% who expected decreases and 23% who saw delays when asked the same question back in April. This time around, a small number - 10% - even saw an increase to their 2020 investments, something no one did in April.
While that still means a big overall hit to foreign direct investment after 2019's record year, EY noted that 21% of those surveyed believed Europe would be more attractive for investment post-Covid compared to just 8% in April.
""It is promising that investors believe that over the next three years, Europe will become a much more attractive destination for investments than before pandemic,"" EY Area Managing Partner Julie Teigland said.
The findings were based on interviews with 109 global executives across 14 industries in October. 
Upbeat news from vaccine trials are starting to support economic sentiment. The monthly eurozone Purchase Managers Index (PMI) for November saw a rise in its ""future output"" component in November to its highest level since February.

Among the other takeaways from the EY survey, 63% expected faster roll-out of digital customer access to surveys in the next three years (versus 55% in April) but only 37% now saw a reversal of globalisation (versus 56%).

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 23, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing, services activity expanding rapidly in November: IHS Markit","(Reuters) - U.S. business activity expanded at the fastest rate in more than five years in November led by the quickest pickup in manufacturing since September 2014, a survey showed on Monday in an indication the economy keeps making progress at clambering out of the COVID-19 recession even as infections surge.
IHS Markit's manufacturing and services sector purchasing managers' indexes both topped even the most optimistic forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted both would level off, offering a counterweight to data suggesting economic momentum was slackening after the third-quarter's torrid rebound from an historic plunge last spring.
The readings also offered one of the first pictures of the state of the U.S. economy after a presidential election three weeks ago in which Democrat Joe Biden beat incumbent Republican President Donald Trump.
""The upturn reflected a further strengthening of demand, which in turn encouraged firms to take on staff at a rate not previously seen since the survey began in 2009,"" IHS Markit Chief Business Economist Chris Williamson said in a statement.
Markit's manufacturing index climbed to 56.7 from 53.4 in October, above the median forecast in a Reuters economists' poll of 53. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
The services index, meanwhile, rose to 57.7 - the highest since April 2015 - from 56.9 a month earlier. The Reuters poll had pegged the expectation at 55.0.
Markit's composite index - a blend of the manufacturing and services readings - increased to 57.9 from 56.3 in October. It was also the highest since April 2015.
Markit said its subindex for employment also rose at a record pace as well, potentially welcome news in a U.S. job market that still features more than 10 million people without work who had been employed before the COVID-19 pandemic erupted in the first quarter.
With the election now over and subsequent news of successful COVID-19 vaccine candidates, Markit said survey respondents were the most optimistic about the year ahead since May 2014.
Nonetheless, Markit's survey results about current activity are at odds with a number of other recent readings on the U.S. economy that are far less favorable as a result of a resurgence in COVID-19 that has lead to record after record of new daily infections and rising deaths.
Last week, October retail sales reported from the Commerce Department showed the weakest increase in six months, while the Labor Department reported the first weekly increase in new claims for unemployment benefits in a month.
Meanwhile, a clutch of high-frequency indicators tracked by economists for a real-time reading on activity showed further signs of flattening out.

It is clear the U.S. economy in the fourth quarter will come nowhere close to matching 33.1% annualized growth rate in gross domestic product posted in the July to September period, but just how much it has slowed remains less certain. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's ""GDPNow"" model currently estimates activity in the current quarter expanding at a 5.6% annualized rate.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone business activity contracted sharply this month as renewed lockdowns forced many firms in the bloc's dominant service industry to close temporarily, although news of possible vaccines boosted hopes for 2021, surveys showed on Monday.
The bloc's economy is on track for its first double-dip recession in nearly a decade as a second wave of the coronavirus sweeps across Europe, a Reuters poll suggested last week. But on Monday, Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said its vaccine could be around 90% effective without any serious side effects. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have also developed apparently effective vaccines and Monday's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed optimism about the year ahead improving to its highest since before the pandemic hit the continent. 
Still, IHS Markit's headline flash composite PMI, seen as a good guide to economic health, fell to 45.1 in November from October's 50.0 - the level separating growth from contraction. A Reuters poll had predicted a shallower dip to 46.1.
""The drop in the composite PMI to well below 50 adds to the evidence that the euro zone economy will post another sizeable contraction in Q4,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics. 
""But with vaccines looking increasingly likely to be rolled out in the first half of next year, the surveys show greater optimism about 2021.""
Vaccine hopes, and expectations of more stimulus from the European Central Bank next month, meant optimism improved. The composite future output index jumped to 60.1 from 56.5, its highest since February.
Shares and oil prices rose on Monday while the dollar softened. 
FACTORIES TO THE RESCUE
Services activity in Germany, Europe's largest economy, contracted faster this month after lockdown measures were introduced while in France the economy shrank at the fastest pace since May, sister surveys showed.
In Britain, which is outside the euro zone and European Union and has suffered the highest COVID-19 death toll in Europe, a new wave of coronavirus restrictions hammered the huge services sector. 
A PMI covering the euro zone's service industry fell to 41.3 from 46.9, its weakest reading since the height of the first wave of the pandemic and well below the 42.5 predicted in a Reuters poll.
With demand drying up despite price cuts and backlogs of work being run down, firms reduced headcount for a ninth month in succession. The services employment index fell to 48.1 from 48.5.
However, manufacturing has fared better as many factories have remained open. Its flash PMI held well above the breakeven mark at 53.6 in November, albeit below October's 54.8. The Reuters poll had predicted 53.1.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, fell to 55.5 from 58.4. Demand also eased - the new orders index sank to 54.0 from 58.7 - indicating that the downward trend may continue.
""The good news is that the fall was cushioned by a strong manufacturing sector. Buoyed by Germany, the manufacturing PMI merely indicated a slowing of output growth, but not contraction,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.

""Still, as the second part of the W-shape has just started, a long and uncertain road to recovery remains ahead.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British business activity has contracted in November as a new wave of coronavirus restrictions hammered the huge services industry, but news of possible vaccines has sharply boosted hopes for 2021, a survey showed on Monday.
An early ""flash"" reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a gauge of private sector growth, tumbled to a five-month low of 47.4 in November from 52.1 in October.
It is the first time the index has gone below the 50.0 growth threshold level since June.
The decline was smaller than a slump to 42.5 forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, however, and less severe than the drop in the euro zone.
The forward-looking component of the PMI hit its highest in more than five years, boosted by progress on COVID-19 vaccines.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Monday he hoped the economy would be ""turning a leaf"" next year, but warned that some long-term damage was inevitable. 
Britain's economy is widely expected to contract in the fourth quarter - albeit by less than it did around the time of the first coronavirus lockdown - after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a four-week lockdown for England.
Other parts of the United Kingdom have also imposed restrictions on businesses, including in hospitality and other face-to-face activities.
Those closures helped to push the services PMI to 45.8 from 51.4 in October.
But manufacturing, which was largely unaffected by the latest lockdown, accelerated, with its PMI rising to 55.2, the joint-highest level since 2018.
""The two-speed nature of the recovery is increasingly clear,"" J.P. Morgan Asset Management strategist Hugh Gimber said. ""The manufacturing sector continues to tick along at a healthy pace, while new lockdowns have slammed the brakes on the nascent recovery in the service sector.""
The approach of a possible trade shock at the end of next month, when Britain's post-Brexit transition deal with the European Union will expire, prompted clients of British factories to increase their orders to build up stocks.
That in turn lead to a sharp lengthening of supplier delivery times because of severe delays at British ports.
Job losses across the private sector accelerated, although some of the reduction in employment was due to companies taking advantage of the government's extended jobs protection scheme.

Separate figures on Monday showed the number of people visiting shops in Britain last week was 55% lower than a year earlier.

IHS Markit's flash services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 46.2 from 49.5 in October, sliding further below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction and marking a second straight month of decline. A Reuters poll had predicted a drop to 46.3.
The survey also showed that activity in the manufacturing sector continued to grow, albeit at a slightly slower pace, offering support to an economy otherwise forecast to post its deepest recession this year since World War Two.
Activity in the factory sector eased to a still-healthy 57.9 from 58.2 in October, beating a forecast for a drop to 56.5.
""The resilience being exhibited by the manufacturing sector, which the survey shows is benefiting for growing sales to Asia in particular, supports our view that any downturn in the final quarter is expected to be far shallower than those seen in the first half of the year,"" said IHS Markit's Associate Director Phil Smith.
""The positive news surrounding the development of COVID vaccines has helped lift the spirits among German businesses, many of which are now hoping for a return to normality over the next 12 months,"" he added.
""This looks to have been a supportive factor in the latest employment figures, which show factory jobs numbers moving closer to stabilisation and services payrolls edging higher.""

The survey also showed a higher-than-average 40% of new construction was pre-let, signalling less speculative building.
At least six speculative schemes were put entirely on hold pending more clarity, with many more postponed until 2021, Deloitte said. 
Developers reported that weak tenant demand was the major obstacle to starting any new project after the pandemic forced many people to work from home, leaving parts of the capital almost deserted. 
The shift to working from home has prompted many companies to consider a longer-term, more flexible approach to office attendance, prompting questions over future demand for tower blocks in the capital.

The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, reported monthly confidence index of 56.1 in November, up from the October reading of 55.
A reading of above 50 indicates a positive business outlook.

1190,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>","French, Italian economies hurt most under second lockdowns","By Leigh Thomas
PARIS (Reuters) - Lockdowns in France and Italy are weighing down public mobility more than in other European countries, according to high- frequency data compiled by Reuters that suggest the two economies will take a correspondingly bigger hit.
Data ranging from use of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) maps apps to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s user location history are proving vital tools for governments, central bankers and investors trying to gauge the economic impact of restrictions, weeks in advance of conventional indicators like consumer spending or industrial output.
The French official stats agency INSEE has found that the data Google can collect on how much time people spend at home is particularly closely correlated with how much an economy has slowed during the crisis.
And while the impact is nowhere near as pronounced as during the first set of more draconian lockdowns this year, that data suggest that people in France, Italy and Britain are currently seeing the biggest increases in the time spent at home.
Paris and Milan have also seen the sharpest reductions in traffic congestion, and Italy the steepest decline in public transport usage, ahead of the Netherlands, UK and France.

Germany's ""lockdown lite"" imposed on Nov. 2 has left indicators of activity holding up much better than in countries that have gone for tougher measures, such as closing all but essential shops and services.
Spain was among the hardest hit in the first wave, but its activity also appears be resisting better after it imposed a six-month state of emergency at the end of October, giving its regions legal backing to implement curfews and restrict travel.
Graphic: Changes in traffic congestion in European capitals - https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-ECONOMY/nmopadyglva/chart.png
Overall, countries are seeing less of a blow to activity than in the first wave of lockdowns after governments calibrated restrictions this time to limit the economic fallout. For comparison, mobility is around the same levels as seen in May.
In a case in point, France has seen a sharp fall in activity since the government was one of the first in Europe to put the country back under a full lockdown on Oct. 30.
However, the drop is not as dire as in March and April with the new French lockdown allowing considerably more flexibility for companies and schools left open.
Graphic: Apple mobility trends in public transport - https://graphics.reuters.com/EUROPE-ECONOMY/jznpnnjolpl/chart.png
Other real-time indicators like electricity consumption also show little impact from the new wave of restrictions across Europe, although colder weather is also fuelling demand heading into the winter.
Meanwhile, governments have largely spared their industrial sectors under the new restrictions, as the service sector bears the brunt of the fallout.
The German official stats agency's truck toll mileage index https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/EXDAT/Datensaetze/truck-toll-mileage.html, which it says is a bellwether for industrial production in Europe's biggest economy, is currently running at levels on par with those seen before the coronavirus crisis broke out.
While overall economic activity has cooled once again heading into the year end, some traditional indicators of economic health such as unemployment and bankruptcy filings are still not flashing red.

But that is likely to be because of government support measures like subsidised furlough schemes and state-guaranteed bank loans to companies are keeping consumers and businesses afloat - at least for now.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 20, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",UK borrowing hits new record as Sunak readies spending plan,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain borrowed a record 215 billion pounds ($285 billion) in the first seven months of the financial year, highlighting the challenge facing finance minister Rishi Sunak as he prepares new spending plans.
Borrowing in October alone came in below all economists' forecasts in a Reuters poll at 22.3 billion pounds, and September's borrowing was also revised sharply lower.
But debt remained only slightly lower than a 60-year high as a share of the economy.
Separate official data published on Friday showed retail sales rose 1.2% in October, and were 5.8% higher than a year earlier, stronger than all poll forecasts. 
However, retailers face a grim November with many shops closed due to the latest restrictions to slow the coronavirus pandemic which has hit Britain harder than other big economies.
The British government is on course to borrow close to 400 billion pounds this financial year, the highest borrowing relative to the size of the economy since World War Two.
""This is the responsible thing to do, but it’s also clear that over time it’s right we ensure the public finances are put on a sustainable path,"" finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
The government's Office for Budget Responsibility will publish new forecasts of borrowing on Nov. 25, and Sunak will unveil spending plans for the next financial year too. 
The government has already said it will approve the biggest increase in military spending since the Cold War. 
But newspapers reported Sunak would freeze the pay of teachers and police, and the government has refused to confirm it will keep foreign aid spending at 0.7% of GDP.
Public debt has surged and stood at 2.077 trillion pounds or 100.8% of annual economic output in October, the Office for National Statistics said.
Stronger growth in the economy in the third quarter meant that as a share of GDP, debt was down slightly from September's peak of 101.2%, the highest level since 1960/61.
The ONS trimmed its estimate for April-September borrowing by 15.9 billion pounds after lower-than-expected spending on the government's flagship job protection scheme and higher-than-expected value added tax receipts.
Britain, for now at least, can borrow cheaply to fund its spending surge, much of which is likely to end once the pandemic passes.
But the Bank of England has warned that some long-term economic damage or scarring is likely.
Last month the International Monetary Fund said Britain would probably need to raise taxes after the pandemic to fill the gap.
EARLY CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
Friday's data show unexpected strength in the retail sector in October, before a four-week COVID lockdown took effect in England this month.
""Feedback from a range of businesses suggesting that consumers had started Christmas shopping earlier this year, further helped by early discounting from a range of stores,"" the ONS said.
Retailers have bounced back strongly from the lockdown, with sales volumes 6.7% higher than before the pandemic. 
Shifts in consumer spending have helped specialist stores such as bicycle and car part chain Halfords (L:HFD).
But much of the gain has been from online sales, and some sectors such as high-street clothes stores are struggling.

Fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger fell into administration on Thursday, putting 4,716 jobs at risk.

1192,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market losing steam as COVID-19 rages,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits rose last week, likely as new business restrictions to control spiraling COVID-19 infections unleashed a fresh wave of layoffs, which could further slow the labor market recovery.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed at least 20.3 million people on unemployment benefits at the end of October, threatening the recovery from the worst recession since the Great Depression.
About 12 million people will lose benefits next month when two government-funded programs expire a day after Christmas. Another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed is unlikely before then. President Donald Trump is heavily focused on disputing his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, who will inherit the public health crisis and a frail economy when he takes office in January.
""You don't have to warn the jobless that momentum is fading and the risks are high, they are living it every day without a paycheck and with employment opportunities in increasingly short supply,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
""The blame falls squarely on Washington where there is no attempt to fight the virus in a coordinated manner or to fight the recession by renewing and extending the unemployment benefits to the millions of jobless workers in the country."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 742,000 for the week ended Nov. 14. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 707,000 applications for the latest week.
Unadjusted claims rose 18,344 to 743,460 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number because of earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations due to the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.1 million people filed claims last week.
Claims have remained above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession for 35 straight weeks. 
Daily new COVID-19 cases in the United States have been exceeding 100,000 since early November, pushing the number of infections in the country above 11 million, according to a Reuters tally. Forty-one states have reported daily record increases in coronavirus infections. The nation's death toll has surpassed 250,000.
Many jurisdictions have imposed restrictions on businesses to try to contain the spread of the virus.
""With more localized restrictions and signs of households hunkering down the past couple of weeks, we expect initial filings to stay elevated,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The ebbing economic momentum was underscored by a survey from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve on Thursday showing manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region slowing in November as orders moderated. Though factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware hired more workers and increased hours, manufacturers were less upbeat about business conditions and capital expenditure programs over the next six months. 
But the housing market continues to shine. Existing home sales increased 4.3% to a rate of 6.85 million units in October, the highest level since November 2005, the National Association of Realtors said in a third report. 
U.S. stocks were mixed. The dollar (DXY) rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
RECOVERY SLOWING
Unemployment claims dropped from a record 6.867 million in March as about 80% of the people temporarily laid off in March and April were rehired, accounting for most of the rebound in job growth over the last six months.
The latest wave of coronavirus infections and restrictions will weigh heavily on bars and restaurants as well as other businesses in the services sector that attract crowds.
It coincides with the end of more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief, which helped to preserve jobs. 
The government-funded program for people who do not qualify for state benefits and another for those who have exhausted their six months of eligibility will lapse in December, creating what economists have called an income cliff.
""The loss of benefits would lead to a big hit in household incomes and spending, putting the recovery at risk,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The claims data covered the period that the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls portion of November's employment report. Claims have become an unreliable gauge of job growth because of filing problems. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 638,000 jobs in October, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. Only 12.1 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered. 
Though the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 429,000 to 6.372 million in the week ending Nov. 7, that was because many have exhausted their eligibility, which is limited to six months in most states.

A record 4.377 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Oct. 31, up 233,458 from the prior week.

1193,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales rise for fifth straight month,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased for a fifth straight month in October, but record-high house prices because of tight supply could slow momentum.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing home sales increased 4.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.85 million units last month. Data for September was revised up to a rate of 6.57 million units from the previously reported 6.54 million units. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would fall 1.2% to a rate of 6.45 million units in October.
Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, jumped 26.6% on a year-on-year basis in October. Sales increased in all four regions last month and continued to be concentrated in the upper price end of the market.
The housing market is being driven by record low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home, has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.84%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Housing supply has failed to keep up with demand, pushing home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. The government reported on Wednesday that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, raced to the highest level since April 2007.
There were 1.42 million previously owned homes on the market in October, down 19.8% from a year ago. The median existing house price surged 15.5% from a year ago to a record $313,000 in October.

At October's sales pace, it would take 2.5 months to exhaust the current inventory, an all-time low. That was down from 2.7 months in September and 3.9 months in October 2019. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans filing initial claims for state jobless benefits last week unexpectedly rose to 742,000, as concerns mounted that soaring COVID-19 cases will further stifle the recovery in the labor market.
Economists had expected a drop to 707,000. The prior week's figure was revised up to 711,000, according to the Labor Department report. The increase was the first in six weeks. The increase in claims was largest in California and Washington, while Illinois, Kentucky and Georgia all posted falls.
The number of continuing claims fell to 6.372 million, a little lower than forecast.
The number of people hospitalized with the virus rose to a new record high of over 79,000 on Wednesday, while the death count hit its highest since early May.
Many states are imposing fresh rounds of social distancing restrictions, affecting businesses. Meanwhile, economic growth is slowing as a boost from fiscal stimulus earlier in the year peters out. The economy fell into recession in February, rebounding strongly in the third quarter before losing momentum again from October onward.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in October as the housing market continues to be driven by record low mortgage rates, but momentum could slow amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections that is putting strain on the economic recovery.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday also showed building permits unchanged at a 13-1/2-year high. It followed on the heels of data on Tuesday showing the smallest gain in retail sales in October since the recovery from the pandemic started in May. The economy is slowing as more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief dries up.
Daily new COVID-19 cases have been exceeding 100,000 since early this month, pushing the number of infections in the United States above 11 million, according to a Reuters tally. Several states and local governments have imposed restrictions on businesses, raising fears that the resulting weak demand could unleash a fresh wave of layoffs that could reverberate across the economy and slow the housing market's run. 
""The million dollar question remains how long the recovery in housing can continue as the shocking number of new coronavirus cases is paralyzing commerce in many parts of the country and leading to new restrictions and lockdowns,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Housing starts rose 4.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.530 million units last month. That lifted homebuilding closer to its pace of 1.567 million units in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would rise to a rate of 1.460 million units in October.
Permits for future homebuilding were unchanged at a rate of 1.545 million units in October, the highest since March 2007. 
The densely populated South region accounted for 56.1% of homebuilding last month. Groundbreaking activity also rose in the West and Midwest, but tumbled in the Northeast. 
Homebuilding surged 14.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, raced 6.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.179 million units last month, the highest level since April 2007.
Single-family starts have increased for six straight months. This segment of the market is being boosted by the pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home. That has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out spacious accommodation for home offices and schools.
""The South and inland and mountain regions of the West are seeing a huge influx of residents from the large metro areas in the Northeast and West Coast,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Just over 80% of all single-family homes built over the past year have been in the South or West, which means that construction can continue at a much higher pace during the winter months than in prior years.""
A survey on Tuesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rose to an all-time high in November. But builders said ""lot and material availability is holding back some building activity."" 
Single-family building permits climbed 0.6% to a rate of 1.120 million units in October. 
A separate report on Wednesday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to buy a home increased 4% last week from a week earlier. 
The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits.
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, outperforming a mixed U.S. stock market. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices of longer-dated U.S. Treasuries were trading higher.
BIGGER FOOTPRINT
Though the housing market accounts for a fraction of gross domestic product, it has a bigger economic footprint. Its continued strength should help to keep the economy afloat even as GDP growth is expected to decelerate significantly in the fourth quarter after a historic performance in the July-September period.
Homebuilding is being driven by lean inventories, especially for previously-owned homes, and low mortgage rates. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.84%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Starts for the volatile multi-family segment were unchanged at a pace of 351,000 units. Building permits for multi-family housing projects fell 1.6% to a rate of 425,000 units. It was the third straight monthly decline.
""This is an indication that developers are reining in investment as rental vacancy rates have risen,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics in New York.
According to Wells Fargo Securities' Vitner, rental data also suggest a shift in renter preferences away from urban lifestyle apartments to suburban apartments that offer more outdoor amenities. 

Housing completions fell 4.5% to a rate of 1.343 million units last month. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction increased 1.2% to a rate of 1.224 million units, the highest since December 2006.

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro was plus 0.2% month-on-month in October for a 0.3% year-on-year fall, the same annual decline as in September and in line with the initial estimates released at the start of November.
Food, alcohol and tobacco added 0.38 percentage points to the final results, Eurostat said, and services another 0.19 points, but an 8.2% year-on-year plunge in energy prices subtracted 0.81 percentage points from the final number.
Non-energy industrial goods also reduced inflation by 0.03 points. 
Without volatile energy and unprocessed food prices, what the European Central Bank (ECB) calls core inflation, prices rose 0.1% month-on-month and 0.4% year-on-year.
An even narrower measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco showed a 0.1% month-on-month and a 0.2% year-on-year increase.
The ECB wants to keep inflation below, but close to 2% over the medium term.
Across the euro zone, the highest inflation was 1.6% in Slovakia, followed by 1.2% in the Netherlands and by 1.1% in Austria.
Declines were sharpest in Greece at 2.0%, Estonia at 1.7% and 1.5% in Ireland.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in October and could slow further, restrained by spiraling new COVID-19 infections and declining household income as millions of unemployed Americans lose government financial support.
While other data on Tuesday showed production at factories accelerating last month, output remained well below its pre-pandemic level and the uncontrolled coronavirus outbreak could disrupt production. The public health crisis and frail economy are major challenges confronting President-elect Joe Biden when he takes over from President Donald Trump in January.
Biden on Monday urged a divided Congress to come together and pass another pandemic relief package.
That is unlikely to happen before he is sworn in on Jan. 20, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to pump more money into the economy, which plunged into recession in February. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the recovery was slowing, adding the economy would continue to need support from both fiscal and monetary policy.
""It looks like consumer spending is increasingly turning into a headwind for this recovery from the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Fed officials are saying they might have to do more and today's data may turn that thinking into a reality."" 
Retail sales rose 0.3% last month, the smallest gain since the recovery started in May, after increasing 1.6% in September, the Commerce Department said. They account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare and hotel accommodation making up the other portion.
Sales were supported by Amazon.com's (O:AMZN) ""Prime Day"" event, with online receipts surging 3.1%. ""Prime Day"" is normally in July and some economists said this could have thrown off the model that the government uses to strip seasonal fluctuations from the data, leading to the modest sales gain.
Consumers bought motor vehicles at a much slower pace than in previous months. There were increases in sales of electronics and appliances, as well as building materials and garden equipment. But households cut back spending on sporting goods and hobbies, clothing, furniture, drinking and dining out.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.5% in October. Retail sales rose 5.7% on a year-on-year basis in October and are above their February level, with the pandemic shifting demand away from services to goods.
Stocks on Wall Street were mostly lower. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose. 
Daily new coronavirus cases have been exceeding 100,000 since early this month, pushing the number of infections in the United States above 11 million, according to a Reuters tally.
While there have been encouraging developments on experimental vaccines, health experts warn that rolling out the vaccines would be challenging. 
Some state and local governments have imposed new restrictions on businesses. 
Restrictions and consumer avoidance of crowded places like bars and restaurants could undercut spending and trigger another wave of layoffs, further squeezing incomes following the loss of a government weekly unemployment subsidy. 
PROGRAMS LAPSING 
The supplement, which was part of more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief, has lapsed for millions of unemployed and underemployed workers. 
Millions more will lose benefits next month when government-funded programs for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for regular state unemployment and those who have exhausted their six months of eligibility expire. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales gained 0.1% after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase in September. These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have risen 1.4% in September.
Economists expect moderate retail sales growth for the rest of the year, which would contribute to slower economic growth after a historic rebound in gross domestic product in the third quarter. A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) survey of credit and debit cardholders showed a broad decline in spending through Nov. 9, with big drops in states where COVID-19 is spreading most rapidly.
Consumer sentiment ebbed in early November amid worries about finances. 
A separate report from the Fed on Tuesday showed manufacturing output increased 1.0% last month after rising 0.1% in September. Production remains about 5% below its pre-pandemic level. Output was boosted by production of aerospace and miscellaneous transportation equipment, offsetting decreases in furniture, fabricated metal products, motor vehicles and parts. 
""Manufacturing can only hold up if households keep buying and they need income to do that,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Mining output fell 0.6% as oil and gas extraction declined. Weakness in oil and gas extraction is likely to continue depressing business spending on nonresidential structures, buttressing forecasts for moderate growth in the fourth quarter.

Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 33.1% rate in the July-September quarter after contracting at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

Retail inventories surged 1.7% in September instead of 1.6% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 0.5% increase in August. Motor vehicle inventories accelerated 3.1%, rather than 3.2% as previously reported.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 1.1% instead of 0.9% as estimated last month.
Inventories contributed to a historic 33.1% annualized rate of growth in GDP in the third quarter. That followed a 31.4% rate of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. Inventories had been a drag on GDP for five straight quarters.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.4% in September. Stocks at manufacturers were unchanged.

The survey by research group Dynata asked more than 5,000 people in Germany, France, Britain, the United States and Australia how they would change their behaviour once a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available.
Most respondents said they were looking forward to visiting friends or relatives again (61%) and leaving the house more often (53%), the survey showed.
In Germany and Britain, nearly half of respondents said they were looking forward to going on vacation abroad again.
Overall, one in two respondent was looking forward to not having to wear a face mask anymore. But only 12% said they were looking forward to spending more money and to focus less on savings, according to the findings.

During the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in spring, the saving rate in Germany, for example, doubled to 20% as many consumers had to stay at home and shops were forced to close.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland enacted new COVID-19 health restrictions last month and England began a one-month lockdown on Nov. 5 to curb a second wave of the pandemic that has left the United Kingdom with Europe's highest death toll.
In England, all non-essential shops had to close, along with pubs, cafes and restaurants except to offer takeaway food. People have also been encouraged to work from home if possible.
Springboard said shopper numbers, or footfall, was 64.7% lower year-on-year in UK high streets and 65.7% lower in shopping centres but down 34.3% in retail parks.
It noted that footfall was more resilient than it was in the first complete week of England's first lockdown in March when it plunged by 75.1% across all UK retail destinations.
""The fact that footfall is more resilient may well be a function of the proximity of Christmas, and the concern of shoppers to buy well in advance this year to avoid queues, facilitated by the wide range of non-food products offered in stores selling essential goods,"" said Springboard director Diane Wehrle.

The researcher said that following the end of a two week lockdown in Wales, footfall in its retail destinations rose by 135.9% last week from the week before, providing an indication of what may occur in England when the latest lockdown ends on Dec. 2.

Investing.com – China continued its path towards economic recovery in October, with a faster-than-expected rise in industrial production and investment alongside a steadier uptick in consumer spending.
Data from China’s National Statistics Bureau (NSB) showed that industrial production rose 6.9% year-on-year in October, above the 6.5% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but unchanged from September’s reading.
Meanwhiles retail sales grew 4.3% year-on-year in October, down from the forecast 4.9% but up from September’s growth of 3.3%. The unemployment rate fell to 5.3% from September’s 5.4%.
The data indicated a continuous recovery from the COVID-19-inspired lockdowns earlier in the year, helped along by resilient exports. With the virus largely under control in the country, consumer spending is slowly starting to increase.
China’s fourth-quarter economic growth will continue to accelerate from the third quarter, Fu Linghui, spokesman of the National Statistics Bureau, predicted at a briefing after the data was released. He aded that consumption prospects are improving, with the services industry showing good recovery momentum.
Although the recovery in consumer spending was slower than in industrial production, it is catching up after receiving a boost from October’s golden week holiday and the various Singles’ Day event that took place during the previous week. However, data revealed that retails sales are still down 5.9% compared to the same period in 2019.
Macquarie Bank Ltd head of China economics Larry Hu expects growth to pick up to 5.5% in the fourth quarter from 4.9% in the previous three months.
“The strong part of the economy (industry, investment and exports) remains strong but is also around the peak,” he said. “The weak part (consumption and capital expenditure) is catching up,” Hu told Bloomberg.
Stimulus policies from the government, including the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) injecting more liquidity into the financial system earlier in the day, are also helping to maintain the economic recovery.
Although PBOC officials recently raised the possibility of withdrawing stimulus, they also added that any withdrawal should not be rushed.
“China continues to move closer to its potential growth … as the growth outlook remains positive, the authorities will prioritize reforms over stimulus,” Australia and New Zealand Banking Group chief economist for Greater China Raymond Yeung told Bloomberg.
Surging COVID-19 cases globally, particularly in Europe and the U.S., alongside rising U.S.-China tensions, are clouding exports’ outlook.
Meanwhile, former Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei said during the previous week that trade frictions between the United States and China may not ease in the near-term, even under a Joe Biden presidency.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japan also recorded a third quarter GDP growth of 21.4% year-on-year, and 5% quarter-on-quarter."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy shrank more slowly in the third quarter, with the contraction limited to 6.4% thanks to a recovery in domestic activity after coronavirus restrictions were eased but an ongoing travel ban has kept most foreign tourists away.
The data released on Monday by the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDB) showed a marked improvement from the June quarter, when the economy suffered a 12.1% decline, the sharpest fall in over two decades.
On a quarterly basis, the economy expanded a seasonally adjusted 6.5% in the September quarter, the fastest pace in more than eight years, after a record contraction of 9.9% in the prior quarter.
Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast the economy would shrink 8.6% year-on-year and grow 3.8% quarter-on-quarter.
As a result, the government raised its 2020 outlook for a contraction of 6.0% from a previous forecast 7.3%-7.8% decline. It now expects exports to fall 7.5% this year, rather than drop 10%.
The upgrade came in amid a slump in tourism, tepid global demand, a strong baht  and months of domestic political protests.
""The Q3 data was quite a surprise but the economic picture has not changed and we expect a decline until the first quarter,"" said Thammarat Kittisiripat, economist of Tisco group.
While Thailand has removed most restrictions as local infections slow, its economy continues to suffer from soft global demand and the absence of foreign tourists. It started last month to let some foreign visitors return.
""A rising trend in the number of COVID-19 cases globally during the Northern Hemisphere winter will subdue the economy for the next two quarters,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research of Kasikornbank.
On Monday, the NESDC said it expected 6.7 million foreign tourists to come to Thailand this year - between April and early October there were none - after last year's record 39.8 million with their spending accounting for 11.4% of GDP.
It predicts only 5 million foreign visitors in 2021.
The government has supported the economy with a 1.9 trillion baht ($63 billion) stimulus package, while the central bank has slashed interest rates by 75 basis points this year to a record low of 0.50%.
The main stock index (SETI) rose 1.37% at 0340 GMT while the baht  was little changed at 30.14 per dollar.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 15, 2020 11:25PM ET</span>",China's factory output beats forecasts as Asia shakes off COVID slump,"By Gabriel Crossley and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory output rose faster-than-expected in October and retail sales sped up, as the recovery in the world's second-largest economy from its COVID-19 slump gathered momentum.
Industrial production climbed 6.9% in October from a year earlier, data from the National Statistics Bureau showed on Monday, in line with September's gain and faster than the 6.5% rise expected in a Reuters poll of analysts.
The upbeat figures came as other Asian powerhouses also climbed out from their pandemic depths with Japan's economy reporting its fastest quarterly growth on record.
China's industrial sector has staged an impressive turnaround from the pandemic paralysis seen earlier this year, helped by resilient exports. Now, with the coronavirus largely under control in China, consumers are opening up their wallets again in a further boost to activity.
""The latest data suggest that the broad-based acceleration of China’s economy continued in October,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics said in a note. 
""Policy stimulus continued to boost investment and industrial output while growth in real retail sales and services activity returned to pre-virus levels.""
Across China, smelters and refineries ramped up production in October with aluminium and crude oil hitting record output levels as the reopened economy stoked demand.
Growth is expected to accelerate in the fourth quarter as the service sector recovery maintains momentum, Fu Linghui, spokesman of the National Statistics Bureau said, told reporters at a briefing.
In the consumer sector, retail sales rose 4.3% on-year, missing forecasts for 4.9% growth but still the fastest growth this year.
The improved appetite for spending was seen with China's auto sales growing 12.5% in October, thanks to surging demand for electric vehicles.
Domestic tourism also saw a strong rebound over the Golden Week holiday last month, although levels were still well short of last year's.
Fixed-asset investment rose 1.8% in January-October from the same period last year, compared with the 1.6% growth forecast and a 0.8% increase in the first nine months of the year.
NOT READY TO TIGHTEN POLICY
China's consistent run of improving data since the second quarter and recent comments from officials have prompted speculation the central bank may start to tighten policy. 
But analysts say policymakers are unlikely to rush winding down existing stimulus amid persistent uncertainties about the pandemic and global demand. 
""Domestic demand remains relatively weak, and any move to tighten policy could hurt the economic recovery,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust.
The government has rolled out a raft of measures including more fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the economy.
Property investment was a key driver of broader spending with October real estate investment up 12.7% from a year ago, the fastest pace since July 2018 and quickening from 12% seen in September, according to Reuters calculations based on NBS data.
Property sales by floor area rose a solid 15.3%, the highest in over three years, while new construction starts expanded 3.5%, improving from last month's fall of 1.9%.
However, government efforts to prevent bubbles in the property sector are gaining traction with Chinese new home prices growing at a slower monthly pace in October amid restrictions imposed in some big cities. 
Private sector fixed-asset investment, which accounts for 60% of total investment, fell 0.7% in January-October, compared with a 1.5% decline in the first nine months of the year.
While China's economic recovery looks to be accelerating, surging coronavirus infections in Europe and the United States have clouded the outlook for exports.
Former Chinese finance minister Lou Jiwei said last week Sino-U.S. trade frictions may not ease in the near-term, even under a Joe Biden presidency.
Analysts believe a Biden administration is likely to maintain a tough political stance on Beijing, keep tight restrictions on China's access to advanced technology, although it could act in a less aggressive and more predictable way than the Trump administration.

China's economy grew 4.9% in the third-quarter from a year earlier, but annual growth could slow to just over 2% for 2020. That would be the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew at the fastest pace on record in the third quarter, rebounding sharply from its biggest postwar slump, as improved exports and consumption helped the country emerge from the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
However, analysts painted the sharp bounceback as a one-off from the depths of recession, and cautioned that any further rebound in the economy will be moderate as a resurgence in infections at home and abroad clouds the outlook.
The world's third-largest economy expanded an annualised 21.4% in July-September, beating a median market forecast for an 18.9% gain and marking the first increase in four quarters, government data showed on Monday.
It was the biggest increase since comparable data became available in 1980 and followed a 28.8% plunge in the second quarter, when consumption took a hit from lock-down measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
""The strong growth in July-September was likely a one-off rebound from an extraordinary contraction caused by the lock-down steps,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The economy may not fall off a cliff. But given uncertainty over the outlook, I would err on the side of caution in terms of the pace of any recovery,"" he said.
The rebound was driven largely by a record 4.7% surge in private consumption, as households boosted spending on cars, leisure and restaurants, a government official told a briefing.
External demand also added 2.9 percentage points to gross domestic product (GDP) growth thanks to a rebound in overseas demand that pushed up exports by 7.0%, the data showed.
But capital expenditure fell 3.4%, shrinking for a second straight quarter in a worrying sign for policymakers hoping to revitalise the economy with private-sector spending.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said the economy still had over 30 trillion yen ($287 billion) of negative output gap, or spare capacity, part of which must be filled by a new stimulus package now in the works.
""We can't make up for all of the output gap just with public works spending. We also need to spur private investment. But the size (of the output gap) is something we'll look at"" in compiling the new spending package, he told a news conference.
A negative output gap occurs when actual output is less than the economy's full capacity and is see as a sign of weak demand.
Without additional stimulus, Japan may experience a fiscal cliff next year as the effect of two big packages deployed earlier this year - worth a combined $2.2 trillion - peter out.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has instructed his cabinet to come up with another package, which analysts say could be sized anywhere between 10-30 trillion yen.
""Nishimura's remark on the 30-trillion-yen output gap suggests the size of the new package would come by as much,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
The Bank of Japan is also expected to extend its corporate funding programme beyond its March deadline, with a decision expected next month or January, analysts say.
Despite some signs of improvement in recent months, analysts expect the world's third-largest economy to shrink 5.6% in the current fiscal year ending in March 2021 and say it could take years to return to pre-COVID levels.

Germany has shut restaurants, bars and gyms, but schools and shops remain open during this second wave of the pandemic in a much lighter lockdown than that seen in the spring.
The risk of recession in Europe's biggest economy during the November to January period rose to 17.7% from 12.6% in October, the data pre-released to Reuters showed. 
The IMK index, which measures the risk of a recession over a three-month period, factored in weak economic data such as falling foreign orders for industrial goods as well as weaker financial market indicators in the November reading.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment fell unexpectedly in early November as households worried about their finances, the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic and the depleted fiscal stimulus, dimming the economy's outlook as the curtain started to close on a challenging year.
The survey from the University of Michigan on Friday also showed Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the Nov. 3 presidential election was weighing on expectations among Republicans, with a slight gain among Democrats.
Daily new coronavirus cases have been exceeding 100,000, with hospitalizations and deaths surging, prompting some state and local governments to impose new restrictions on businesses. Restrictions and consumer avoidance of crowded places could trigger another wave of layoffs and further squeeze incomes following the loss of a government weekly unemployment subsidy.
""The drawdown in sentiment seems to reflect decreased perceptions of household finances, which may be a lagged effect of the dwindling fiscal stimulus,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""More consumers reported lower income than higher income for the first time since 2014.""
The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index dropped to 77 early this month from a final reading of 81.8 in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index little changed at 82. The survey's measure of current conditions was steady. Its gauge of expectations fell to 71.3 from 79.2.
A measure of expectations among Republicans declined to 76.4 from 96.4. It edged up to 69.3 from 68.6 among Democrats.
A weekly unemployment supplement, which was part of more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief, has lapsed for millions of unemployed and underemployed workers. A second rescue package is unlikely before President-elect Biden takes office in January.
Economists expect consumer sentiment will trend lower despite promising developments on experimental vaccines.
""With more and more states starting to impose new restrictions on activity, this highlights the growing downside risks posed by the pandemic for the next few months,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior economist at Capital Economics.
Stocks on Wall Street rose on upbeat results from Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO). The dollar (DXY) dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
VEGETABLE PRICES ROCKETING
Exploding COVID-19 infections and labor market slack are seen keeping a lid on inflation, even as producer prices maintain their steady rise. In a separate report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand climbed 0.3% in October, driven by more expensive food and gasoline, after rising 0.4% in September.
It was the sixth straight monthly increase in the PPI. A 0.5% increase in the price of goods accounted for nearly 60% of the gain in the PPI. Goods rose 0.4% in September.
In the 12 months through October, the PPI advanced 0.5% after rebounding 0.4% in September.
Economists had forecast the PPI would rise 0.2% in October and increase 0.4% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices gained 0.2% in October. The so-called core PPI advanced 0.4% in September. In the 12 months through October, the core PPI increased 0.8% after rising 0.7% in September.
Coming in the wake of data on Thursday showing consumer prices unchanged in October, the PPI report further allayed fears of deflation, a decline in the general price level that is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
Economists expect the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero at least through 2021. The U.S. central Bank has a 2% target, a flexible average. Its preferred inflation measure, the core PCE price index rose 1.5% in September
Wholesale food prices jumped 2.4% in October, accounting for nearly three-fourths of the increase in the cost of goods. Food prices were boosted by a 26.8% surge in the cost of fresh and dry vegetables.
Prices also rose for gasoline, meats, chicken eggs, and thermoplastic resins and materials. Prices fell for light motor trucks and passenger cars, resulting in core goods prices being unchanged after rising 0.4%.
The cost of services rose 0.2% after advancing 0.4% in September. Nearly 40% of the broad-based gain was due to a 1.1% increase in transportation and warehousing services. Margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, climbed 0.2%.
Healthcare costs rose 0.3% and portfolio fees increased 0.5%. Airline tickets were up 1.2%.
Those airline tickets, healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index. With the relevant CPI and PPI components in hand, economists are predicting the core PCE price index rose 1.4% in October.

""Inflation is hard to find at the producer level at the moment and with the second wave of coronavirus cases hitting new records nearly every day, producer goods inflation is unlikely to emerge in coming months,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.

The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index for November decreased to a three-month low of 77 from a final October reading of 81.8, data released Friday showed. The median estimate in Bloomberg’s survey of economists called for a reading of 82.
The measure of expectations dropped by nearly 8 points to 71.3, while a gauge of current conditions was little changed at 85.8. Interviews conducted following the election recorded a substantial negative shift in Republicans’ expectations and no gain among Democrats. The survey began Oct. 28 and concluded late on Nov. 10.
“Republicans now voice the least favorable economic expectations since Trump took office, and Democrats have voiced more positive expectations,’’ Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in the report. “In the months ahead, the partisan gap is likely to enlarge, although the gains will be limited until a potential vaccine is approved and widely distributed.’’
Consumers’ views about their current financial situations deteriorated, to well below the pre-pandemic peaks, the report showed. Net declines in household incomes were reported in early November for the first time since March 2014, with the largest decrease among lower income households and older Americans.
Less optimism about the state of the economy may damp prospects for the holiday shopping season against a backdrop of surging new virus infections across the country. The rising caseloads could weigh on sentiment in the coming months as some cities and states reinstate more restrictive measures.
A separate report on Thursday showed that the modest momentum in the labor market’s recovery remains intact, with initial jobless claims falling by the most in five weeks."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's retail inflation may stay elevated for at least three more months after hitting a six-year high in October, as excess rain has damaged standing crops and seedlings, while edible oils that the country imports have become expensive.
The high prices are a particular cause of concern for India's hundreds of millions of poor people, who have already been squeezed by the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on an economy that contracted a record 23.9% in April-June.
Food items such as onions, potatoes, eggs, meat and tomatoes have a nearly 46% weight in India's retail inflation basket. Food inflation shot up to 11.07% in October, the highest in nine months according to data released on Thursday, sending overall retail inflation surging to 7.61%.
""We were expecting a hefty correction in vegetable prices but just before harvesting, excessive rainfall damaged crops,"" said Amol Ghule, a vegetable trader based in the western state of Maharashtra that dominates India's onion and oilseeds production.
Parts of India's richest state was battered by untimely rain last month.
""Many farmers are having to prepare seedlings again for planting and this will delay supplies from the new season crop,"" Ghule said.
HIGH SPENDING
In the past three months, onion prices have more than quadrupled in India, while soyoil prices (NSOc1) have rallied 23%.
International prices of edible oils, meanwhile, have hit record highs due to falling stocks. India imports 70% of its edible oil from countries such as Malaysia, Argentina, Indonesia and Ukraine.
""Palm oil prices have jumped in Indonesia and Malaysia, soyoil in Argentina and sunflower oil in Ukraine,"" said B.V. Mehta, executive director of industry body the Solvent Extractors' Association.
Poultry prices are rising as Indians flock to chicken shops for some extra protein during the pandemic, while production is low because many chicken farms were closed due to India's virus lockdown. 
Also, high vegetable prices have made eggs more affordable for many poorer people, said Uddhav Ahire, chairman of poultry supplier Anand Agro Group.
Economists say the government's extra spending to revitalise the economy could also keep inflation high. This fiscal year ending March 31, the government is likely to overshoot its budgeted spending of $407.80 billion by more than $60 billion.
Worried about stoking inflation further, the Reserve Bank of India has paused its monetary easing since August, after cutting rates by 115 basis points since March.
For 29-year-old Karan Solanki, now the sole earner in his family after his mother lost her job during the pandemic, higher food prices mean watchful purchases of even the most basic items.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil rose in September for a fifth month, a central bank survey showed on Friday, more than economists had expected and pointing to a solid recovery in the third quarter from the worst of the COVID-19 shock earlier in the year.
The central bank's IBC-Br index, often seen as a good proxy for broader gross domestic product, rose a seasonally-adjusted 1.3% in September from August, above the median 1.0% forecast in a Reuters poll of economists.
It brought the cumulative increase over the third quarter to 9.5%, but still leaves activity 2.5% below its pre-pandemic level in February, the central bank figures show.
(GRAPHIC - Brazil IBC-Br economic activity index: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjpqoeedpx/IBCBR.png)
It was the fifth monthly increase in a row, but because August's rise was revised up to 1.4% from 1.1%, September's increase was the smallest of them all.
Compared to September last year activity was down 0.8%, and on an accumulated 12-month basis it is down 3.3%, both on a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the central bank said.
By this measure, Latin America's largest economy is still 8.3% smaller than it was at its peak in December 2013.
Brazil's economy is expected to register its biggest ever annual slump this year, with the government forecasting a 4.7% fall. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes insists that Brazil will suffer less and will recover more quickly than many other countries due to government and central bank support.
Retail sales have already reached new all-time peaks, as has manufacturing, according to purchasing managers indices. The economy is also creating net job growth again, according to some indicators.
Guedes reiterated his bullish view of the economy this week, saying it is in a 'V-shaped' recovery and could grow by as much as 4% next year.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said the economic output of the 19 countries sharing the euro surged 12.6% quarter-on-quarter in the July-September period, a downward revision from the 12.7% jump reported on Oct 30.
This meant that year-on-year, euro zone GDP was 4.4% lower in the third quarter, rather than 4.3% reported before.
The quarterly surge in activity was the result of economies re-opening after lockdowns in the first two quarters, imposed to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The rebound in economic activity corresponded with a 0.9% quarter-on-quarter increase in employment, Eurostat said, though year-on-year employment was still 2% lower in July-September.
The single currency area also had a slightly higher than expected external trade surplus of 24.5 billion euros in September, Eurostat said, against expectations of 22 billion, and a 17.0 billion surplus a year earlier.
But the improvement was not due to a rise in trade, but because as exports fell only 3.8% while imports plunged 8.9% year-on-year.
In the first nine months of the year, the euro zone's trade deficit with China increased and its surpluses with the United States and Britain fell, but it had a much smaller trade gap with energy exporter Russia as prices plunged and turned deficits into surpluses with Turkey, Norway and South Korea.
Adjusted for seasonal swings, the euro zone's trade surplus in September was 24 billion, up from 21 billion in August as exports rose 4.1% month-on-month and imports rose only 2.7%.

It was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year contractions for the trade-reliant city, but the long recession showed signs of slowing, with a gradual improvement in domestic and external demand on the back of mainland China's recovery.
The third quarter's pace compares with a decline of 9.0% in the previous quarter, and an advance Q3 estimate of a 3.4% contraction.
Activity picked up markedly from a slump early in the year as the government gradually relaxed social distancing measures and people returned to offices and stores.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's central bank provided a rosier growth outlook for 2021 after the economy suffered a smaller contraction in the third quarter, but said it would continue to help households and businesses withstand the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Gross domestic product fell 2.7% in July-September, smaller than the 3.2% decline forecast in a Reuters poll and showing a marked improvement on the 17.1% slump in the second quarter.
The trade-reliant economy recovered from its first contraction since the 2009 financial crisis after the government began gradually easing curbs to contain the virus in May.
The central bank said 125 basis points worth of rate cuts this year would support 2021 growth, but that it would continue to make ""policy support and assistance"" available.
""Going into 2021, growth is expected to recover, benefiting from the improvement in global demand and a turnaround in public and private sector expenditure amid various policy support,"" said Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) Governor Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus at a virtual news conference.
""Future monetary policy considerations will continue to be guided by evolving conditions.""
Private consumption eased 2.6% in the third quarter from a year earlier after a 5.6% decline in the previous three months, the central bank said, while manufacturing grew 3.3% after a 18.3% drop in the second quarter. Gross exports jumped 4.4% in the July-September period after a 15.1% fall.
The BNM also revised its 2021 projections, raising the midpoint growth forecast to 7% from an earlier average of 6.75%.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it expected the central bank to leave rates unchanged throughout 2021, with a low risk of a 25 basis point cut.
While some economists worried that the reimposition of coronavirus restrictions in October would dampen the recovery in Malaysia in the last three months of the year, the central bank said the risks to global growth from COVID-19 had eased.
""The risk to growth from these resurgences is not expected to be as severe as the magnitude of contractions observed in the second quarter,"" Nor Shamsiah added.
Analysts at Capital Economics said Malaysia's outlook was dependent on how well the government managed to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Total infections tripled to over 43,000 cases since a fresh outbreak in September.
""If Malaysia is able contain the second wave, as others in the region have been successful in doing, the economic impact should be relatively small,"" Alex Holmes, Asia economist at Capital Economics said.

1218,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2020 12:20AM ET</span>","Japan's exports, consumer prices to extend declines: poll","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports likely extended declines in October but at a slower pace as improving global demand helped some parts of the trade sector, data next week is expected to show, although a recent resurgence in coronavirus cases complicates the outlook.
Other key data due next week includes core consumer inflation, which is forecast to show the biggest fall in prices since early 2011 as the impact from a sales tax hike last year fades and private demand remains weak due to the pandemic. 
Exports were seen falling 4.5% in October from a year earlier, slowing from a 4.9% decline in September, the poll of 17 economists showed.
Imports were expected to have fallen 9.0% in October from a year earlier, which would result in a trade surplus of 250 billion yen ($2.38 billion).
""Exports are recovering in volume but the pace of recovery could slow amid uncertainties, such as an increase in coronavirus cases in Europe,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has instructed his cabinet to come up with another stimulus package as the pandemic persists.
The government has so far compiled two packages worth a combined $2.2 trillion to ease the pain from the health crisis.
The finance ministry releases trade data at 8:50 a.m. on Wednesday (2350 GMT Tuesday).
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, is forecast to have dropped 0.7% in October from a year earlier, the poll found.
That would be the fastest decline since March 2011 when the index also fell 0.7%.
The boost to prices from the sales tax hike last year has eased while a national campaign promoting domestic travel is also among factors behind declines in the core CPI, economists say.
The government announces CPI at 8:30 a.m. on Friday.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>",U.S. starts fiscal 2021 with 111% jump in October deficit,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government started fiscal 2021 with an October budget deficit of $284 billion, a record for the month, as coronavirus-related outlays spiked sharply from a year earlier and revenues declined, the Treasury Department said on Thursday.
That was 111% higher than the October 2019 deficit of $134 billion and 61% higher than the previous October record of $176 billion in 2009, during the financial crisis and recession.
It follows a record full-year deficit of $3.132 trillion for fiscal 2020, which ended Sept. 30, more than tripling the previous year's shortfall due to COVID-19 aid spending.
Treasury officials said the 2020 deficit was held down partly by far lower outlays and stronger receipts in the early months of that fiscal year before the pandemic closed down large parts of the economy in March.
This year's fiscal deficit could reach $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion if no further coronavirus spending bill is passed by Congress, said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States was on track for a $1 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021 because Republican-passed tax cuts in 2017 had reduced revenues. 
""If we don't do another COVID bill, we're headed back to the old, unsustainable deficit path we were on,"" Goldwein said.
But he added that CRFB, a budget watchdog group, is advocating additional targeted spending to sustain workers in hard-hit sectors, communities and health care efforts, including vaccine distribution, which will have positive effects on growth and federal revenues.
Congress remained at an impasse on Thursday in discussions about possible further aid, as Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell voiced his preference for a $500 billion package, far smaller than the $2.2 trillion in spending sought by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
U.S. federal revenues for October fell 3% to $238 billion, largely due to lower receipts withheld from paychecks resulting from reduced employment levels and a temporary deferment of Medicare and Social Security taxes ordered by President Donald Trump, a Treasury official said.

Outlays for the month increased 37% to $522 billion, which included large increases for health care, food assistance and unemployment compensation and other coronavirus aid programs.

1220,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 01:42PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market gradually healing; inflation still benign,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a seven-month low last week, but the pace of decline has slowed and further improvement could be limited by a raging COVID-19 pandemic and lack of additional fiscal stimulus.
The labor market slack is keeping inflation muted, with other data on Thursday showing consumer prices unchanged in October as moderate gains in the cost of food and rents were offset by cheaper gasoline and healthcare. The frail economy is one of the major challenges President-elect Joe Biden faces when he takes over from President Donald Trump in January.
Tepid inflation could allow the Federal Reserve to keep its ultra-easy monetary policy for a long time to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 recession, with the labor market not expected to move back to full employment before 2023. 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told a European Central Bank forum on Thursday that spreading coronavirus infections posed a risk to the recovery, which he described as slowing. He added it was too soon to assess ""with any confidence"" the impact of promising news on experimental vaccines.
""There are not enough jobs and not enough inflation out there to assuage the worries of Fed officials trying to go it alone to engineer this economic recovery as Washington elected officials dither over providing additional fiscal stimulus,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 48,000 to a seasonally adjusted 709,000 for the week ended Nov. 7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 735,000 applications for the latest week.
Despite claims dropping to their lowest since March, they remained above their peak of 665,000 during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. Weak demand, especially in the services sector, is forcing employers to shed workers. 
Daily new COVID-19 infections are exceeding 100,000 and hospitalizations are surging as cooler weather draws people indoors, prompting some state and local governments to impose new restrictions on businesses. 
Even without restrictions, many consumers are likely to stay away from places like bars, restaurants and gyms, fearing exposure to the illness. Restaurants and gyms moved outdoors during summer. 
Unadjusted claims, viewed by economists as a better measure of layoffs, fell 20,799 to 723,105 last week. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, at least 1 million people filed claims last week.
""Unfortunately, if we see major containment measures kick in again soon after Thanksgiving those jobless claims numbers will climb once more,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street fell on the rising coronavirus infections. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
Unemployment claims peaked at a record 6.867 million in March. Much of the improvement in the labor market came from businesses recalling laid-off and furloughed workers as companies and the unemployed accessed their share of more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief. 
But fiscal stimulus has run out, which will make it harder for the economy to generate enough jobs to absorb the millions of unemployed Americans. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 436,000 to 6.786 million in the week ending Oct. 31, partly reflecting many people exhausting their six months of eligibility.
A record 4.143 million people filed for federal government-funded extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Oct. 24, up 159,776 from the prior week. Economists said this figure was understated as Florida and Georgia had yet to report their numbers. These benefits will run out in December.
During that period there were 551,791 people on state extended jobless benefits, which are also capped at 13 weeks.
Under all programs, 21.2 million people were collecting unemployment checks in late October. 
The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls rose by 638,000 jobs in October, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. That followed 672,000 jobs added in September. Only 12.1 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost in March and April have been recovered.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said its consumer price index was unchanged last month following a 0.2% increase in September. A 0.2% rebound in food prices was offset by a 0.5% drop in the cost of gasoline. 
In the 12 months through October, the CPI climbed 1.2% after increasing 1.4% in September. 
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI was also flat in October after rising 0.2% in the prior month. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.2% after ticking up 0.1% in September. That overshadowed a 0.4% decline in the cost of healthcare.

""As supply shortages are being resolved, sluggish aggregate demand will keep a lid on inflation,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans filing initial claims for state jobless benefits last week fell by more than expected to 709,000, but remained at levels highlighting concerns over the slowing recovery in the labor market amid resurgence in new COVID-19 cases.

The number of continuing claims fell to 6.786 million, also a little lower than forecast.
While jobless claims are at their lowest level since March, when the first wave of pandemic related layoffs hit the U.S. economy, they are still more than three times the rate that claims had run at before the pandemic began.

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said on Thursday that industrial production in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.4% month-on-month in September for a 6.8% year-on-year decline.
That compared with the average expectations in a Reuters poll of economists of respectively a 0.7% increase and a drop of 5.8%.
It also marked the fourth consecutive month of declining production growth from 12.5% in May to 5.3% in July, 0.6% in August and now a slip in September.
Output of durable consumer goods, such as televisions and washing machines, has been the strongest component of the previous months' growth, but fell back 5.3% in September. Energy production was also down, by 1.0% in the month.
All other components rose, notably of non-durable consumer goods, such as clothes, by 2.1%.
The steepest monthly declines were in Italy, Ireland and Portugal at respectively 5.6%, 4.7% and 3.8%. Many countries, such as the euro zone's largest economies Germany and France, recorded increases.
Year-on-year, the only euro zone country with higher production was Portugal. The sharpest fall, of 13.6%, was in Ireland, followed by Germany, the Netherlands and France, with declines of greater than 6%.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>","UK's lagging economy lost more speed in September, worse ahead","By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy grew by a slower than expected 1.1% in September from August, lagging other rich nations as it struggled to recover from the shock of the pandemic even before the latest COVID-19 lockdown.
The slowdown in Thursday's official data cemented expectations that the economy will shrink again as 2020 ends, with uncertainty about the Dec. 31 deadline for a post-Brexit European Union trade deal adding to the coronavirus drag.
Between July and September, gross domestic product grew by a quarterly record of 15.5%. But that failed to make up for its nearly 20% lockdown slump between April and June.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the monthly growth rate to slow less sharply, to 1.5%. 
The economy is being propped up by more than 200 billion pounds of emergency spending and tax cuts ordered by finance minister Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England's almost 900 billion pound bond-buying programme.
Despite those efforts, Britain -- which passed 50,000 coronavirus fatalities on Wednesday, Europe's highest death toll -- has suffered the biggest GDP drop among major economies listed by the Office for National Statistics.
Britain's initial lockdown lasted longer than in other countries and hammered services firms which make up 80% of the economy. 
GDP remained almost 10% smaller than at the end of 2019, twice as big as the falls in Italy, Germany and France and nearly three times the size of the U.S. drop, the ONS said.
BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said there was still a ""huge gap"" in the economy but news of a potentially effective COVID-19 vaccine would help lift the uncertainty.
""It's encouraging for individuals, it's encouraging for businesses and it's encouraging for the economy,"" he told a Financial Times event on Thursday. 
""I think we have to be cautious because obviously there's still quite a way to go in terms of the trialling.""
Last week, before the news of the vaccine trials, the BoE said the world's sixth-biggest economy was likely to shrink by a record 11% in 2020 before growing by just over 7% in 2021.
""Britain's COVID crisis, and its recovery phase, will take far longer than many people first thought,"" said James Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation think-tank, urging Sunak not to start reversing his spending surge quickly.
NEW LOCKDOWN
Sunak said steps taken to restrict the spread of COVID-19 were likely to have slowed economic growth since September. 
""Today's figures show that our economy was recovering over the summer, but started to slow going into autumn,"" he said. ""The steps we've had to take since to halt the spread of the virus mean growth has likely slowed further since then.""
The BoE said last week that GDP could shrink by 2% in the October-December quarter.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a new, month-long lockdown for England from last week as coronavirus cases mounted. But this time construction and manufacturing firms can remain open, and so can schools and universities.
The ONS said Britain's services sector grew by a weaker than expected 1.0% in September from August. Food and accommodation fell by more than 8%, hit by the end of August's one-off state subsidies for diners.
Manufacturing inched up by 0.2% while construction grew by nearly 3%, helped by a post-lockdown housing market pickup.

Business investment was 20.5% below end-2019 levels while household consumption remains down 12.4%.

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 12, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",Singaporeans snap up properties during worst ever recession,"By Aradhana Aravindan and Chen Lin
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singaporean Jason Chen recently bought a S$1.7 million ($1.26 million) three-bedroom apartment in a swanky condominium, upgrading his home in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic which has triggered the country's worst ever recession.
""I know the price will rise"", said the 32-year-old, who has spent nearly a decade working in real estate.
Undeterred by the economic slump and rising unemployment, Chen is among thousands of locals snapping up property in Singapore and taking a share of the market not seen in a decade as travel curbs thwart foreign investors.
This broad-based buying spree, which has pushed prices and sales to multi-year highs, has some parallels with a housing market boom seen in late 2009 as Singapore emerged from the global financial crisis. That forced the government to initiate several rounds of cooling measures to cap surging prices.
Analysts largely don't expect a repeat this time around as those curbs mostly remain in place. But policymakers last week cautioned buyers against the lure of cheap mortgages given the scale of job losses in the wealthy business hub, which have already seen many foreigners leave and the population shrink.
""Given the labour market uncertainties in the current economic situation, prospective buyers should remain prudent in their property purchase,"" the ministry of national development said last week in a written response to a question made in parliament about the risk of a ""bubble"".
The government is expecting the Singapore economy to shrink 5-7% this year, eclipsing a record 2.2% contraction in 1998 and marking the deepest recession since independence in 1965.
Graphic - Singapore's housing market rebound: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvexqqxpr/Singapore%20property%20price%20change%20(002).JPG
""A GOOD BARGAIN""
Property prices in the city-state rose 0.8% in the third quarter to their highest level since 2013, while sales volumes jumped to a two-year peak, the latest data showed.
Singaporeans bought nearly 81% of all private apartments sold in the third quarter, the highest proportion since early 2009, according to an analysis by property agency OrangeTee and Tie.
Some buyers like Jenny Lin, a 26-year-old accountant, have viewed the pandemic as an opportunity to get on the ladder of the world's third most expensive housing market after Hong Kong and Munich, according to property consultant CBRE. 
""When COVID-19 first started you could really get a good bargain on the property price, as many people were rushing to sell their properties away for quick cash to salvage their main business,"" said Lin, who expedited her purchase of a S$530,000 one-bedroom apartment in May. 
Despite the turmoil of 2020, prices of private homes in Singapore fell only in the first quarter and have risen since.
By comparison, prices dropped for four consecutive quarters between the middle of 2008 and 2009, during the global financial crisis.
The overall price rise in 2020 has been modest at just 0.1%. But for buyers like 36-year-old asset manager Amy Zhang, who recently purchased a S$1.17 million investment property, Singapore real estate is a safe bet compared to volatile stock markets which she has invested in for years. 
The tightly controlled market, long viewed as a safe-haven, does pose some risks.
Droves of expatriates, who tend to rent, are leaving the island-state due to retrenchments and tighter foreign labour curbs, driving the first decline in Singapore's population since 2003 and pushing rents lower.
But Zhang, like many others in a country where the land available to developers is tightly controlled to manage prices, bought off plan and is betting on a stronger rental market when her property is ready in two to three years.
Singapore property has long attracted the super-rich from its less developed Southeast Asian neighbours as well as multi-millionaires from China. https://reut.rs/2GRIihC
Political uncertainty in rival Hong Kong has also helped to galvanise that appeal, analysts say, even if some foreign purchases have been put on hold due to COVID-19 travel restrictions.
""Once all travel restrictions are lifted, there will be an inflow of foreign investments into the property market,"" said Chen.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 03:25PM ET</span>","U.S. job openings, hiring point to sluggish labor market recovery","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings increased less than expected in September while hiring fell, suggesting the labor market recovery was petering out even before a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases which is expected to slow momentum.
Though the Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report on Tuesday showed layoffs decreasing to their lowest level in nearly 20 years, there was more than one person competing for a single vacancy. The drop is at odds with significantly high weekly unemployment claims.
The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, marked by tens of millions of Americans on unemployment benefits, is one of the biggest challenges confronting President-elect Joe Biden when he takes over from President Trump next January.
""It's hard to see any signs of backsliding, but there aren't any signs of acceleration in the recovery either,"" said Nick Bunker, director of research at Indeed Hiring Lab. ""In a labor market with 10 million fewer jobs than February, we need to see hiring moving at a faster clip to avoid lasting damage.""
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, were up 84,000 to 6.4 million on the last day of September. Vacancies remained below their 7 million level in February. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings rising to 6.5 million in September.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading mostly lower. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries fell.
The United States is setting daily records for coronavirus cases, which could force state and local governments to impose new restrictions on businesses like restaurants, bars and gyms.
Even without restrictions, consumers fearing exposure to the respiratory illness are likely to stay away, which would hurt demand and hiring. At the same time, economic growth is slowing after a massive boost from fiscal stimulus, which has run out. The economy plunged into recession in February. 
There were increases in job openings in financial activities, professional and business services, health care and social assistance, and leisure and hospitality industries. Federal government job openings decreased 20,000.
The job openings rate was unchanged at 4.3% in September.
""The virus count is hitting records however so it is questionable, given the new mini-lockdowns in many states, whether as many jobs will be required in the future at bars and restaurants, sporting events, museums and amusement parks,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
STIFF COMPETITION FOR JOBS
Hiring declined 81,000 to 5.9 million, led by a 256,000 decrease in federal government as the 2020 Census winds down. Hiring also fell in retail trade and educational services. The hires rate dipped to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. 
The JOLTS report followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy created 638,000 jobs in October, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. Employment remains 10.1 million jobs below its peak in February. Millions of people are experiencing long periods of unemployment.
The JOLTS report showed layoffs fell 200,000 to 1.3 million, the lowest level since December 2000. There were decreases in layoffs in the construction and wholesale trade industries. 
Despite the ebb in layoffs, the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits has remained above its 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession. At least 21.5 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in mid-October. 
The layoffs rate fell to 0.9% from 1.1% in August. Even as layoffs moderated in September, job prospects for the 11.8 million estimated to be unemployed in September were rather bleak with only 6.4 million jobs available.
""For every 18 workers who were officially counted as unemployed, there were only available jobs for 10 of them,"" said 
Elise Gould, a senior economist at Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ""That means, no matter what they did, there were no jobs for 5.4 million unemployed workers. And this misses the fact that many more  weren't counted among the unemployed.""
The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs increased 179,000 to 3.0 million. More people quit their jobs in construction, arts, entertainment and recreation as well as in other services. 
The quits rate increased to 2.1% from 2.0% in August. The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, but it has been distorted during this recession by people quitting to look after children or fearful of contracting COVID-19. 

The labor participation rate for women fell in April to levels last seen in the late 1980s and remains well below levels seen at the start of the year.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 03:40AM ET</span>","China's inflation fails to perk up, defies broader recovery","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory-gate prices fell at a sharper-than-expected pace in October, weighed by soft demand for fuel even as the trade and manufacturing sectors staged impressive recoveries from their COVID-19 slump.
Consumer inflation was also soft, easing to an 11-year low as pork prices snapped a year-and-a-half of steep increases that was fuelled by critical shortages of the popular meat.
While the weaker price gauges largely reflect swings in volatile items, they also show upstream demand for industrial goods remains tepid overall in the world's second-largest economy, despite signs of modest improvement in recent months.
The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.1% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Tuesday, the same pace as in September and slightly more than a 2.0% decline tipped by the median forecast from a Reuters survey of analysts.
""We expect both CPI and PPI to be subdued in Q4,"" said Zhaopeng Xing, markets economist at ANZ. ""However, inflation will likely rebound after Q1 2021, thanks to the growing demand post the pandemic.""
Chinese shares fell following the data, defying a global rally in stocks that was driven by news about the development of a coronavirus vaccine.
On a monthly basis, the PPI was unchanged, slowing from a 0.1% increase the previous month.
Oil and gas extraction prices fell 4.9% month-on-month in October while fuel processing costs declined 1.6%, Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician with the NBS, said in a statement.
The weak inflation contrasts with brisk growth in exports and manufacturing activity, seen as signs of a sustained recovery in China's industrial sector.
China's economic growth accelerated to 4.9% from a year earlier during the third quarter as activity extended its recovery from a record slump at the start of the year. 
Analysts expect the economy to post a small gain for all of 2020 and then expand at a more robust pace in 2021, partly on hopes that COVID-19 vaccines will become available globally.
China's consumer price index rose 0.5% from a year earlier, the slowest since October 2009, separate data showed on Tuesday, missing the 0.8% rise tipped by the Reuters poll and a 1.7% rise in September.
Pork prices fell 2.8% year-on-year in October, marking the first decline after 19 months of sharp increases due to supply constraints from the African swine fever. It had risen 25.5% in September.
The core inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, remained soft, edging up just 0.5%. 
On a monthly basis, CPI fell 0.3% in October. 
""If month-on-month price increases remain muted in the coming months, there is a chance that CPI may fall into deflationary territory,"" said Jingyang Chen, Greater China economist at HSBC. 

""While a gradual recovery in household consumption and lower base may support an upward trajectory in CPI inflation next year, we think the possibility of CPI deflation in the coming months will likely prevent the PBOC from tightening its policy stance by year-end.""

INSEE said the jobless rate jumped to 9.0% from 7.1% in the second quarter, its highest level since the third quarter of 2018.
INSEE said that marked the single biggest quarterly increase on record going back to 1975, but it was largely because the rate had been skewed in the previous two quarters because people were not able to look for work due to a mid-March to mid-May coronavirus lockdown.
The surge risks putting President Emmanuel Macron's goal of reducing unemployment to 7% by the end his term in 2022 out of reach. It he had inherited a jobless rate of 9.5% when he came to office in 2017.
France saw its worst post-war recession in the first and second quarters due to the lockdown, but the economy came back to life in the third quarter - before a second lockdown was imposed on Oct. 30 to contain a new wave of the virus.
The Bank of France said on Monday the country's economic activity was 12% lower than normal this month, after it entered the new lockdown.

In a separate report, INSEE said that industrial production had risen 1.4% in September from August, beating expectations on average for 0.8% in a Reuters poll.

LONDON (Reuters) - British employers made a record number of staff redundant in the third quarter and the jobless rate jumped, according to official data that show the labour market declined rapidly before finance minister Rishi Sunak made a U-turn on COVID support measures.
A record 314,000 British workers were made redundant in the three months to September, 181,000 more than in the second quarter, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday.
The unemployment rate rose to 4.8%, as expected in a Reuters poll of economists and the highest rate since the three months to November 2016.
While the public and investors were cheered on Monday by news that an experimental COVID-19 vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech was more than 90% effective in trials, the ONS data showed some hard months lie ahead for many Britons.
""September's rise in the unemployment rate from 4.5% in August to 4.8% suggests that the previous scaling back of the furlough scheme took its toll,"" economist Ruth Gregory from the consultancy Capital Economics said.
""And with the second lockdown set to send the recovery into reverse, the unemployment rate may yet climb to about 9% next year.""
Employment fell by 164,000 during the quarter, the data showed - a sharper drop than the Reuters poll consensus of 148,000.
The Bank of England last week forecast that Britain's unemployment rate would reach 6.3% by the end of this year and peak at nearly 8% in the second quarter of next year.
Last week finance minister Rishi Sunak extended his costly coronavirus furlough scheme, which provides 80% of the pay of temporarily laid-off workers, until the end of March and he announced billions of pounds in other forms of support.
Sunak said the figures ""underline the scale of the challenge we're facing"".
""I want to reassure anyone that is worried about the coming winter months that we will continue to support those affected,"" he said in a statement after the data was published.
The BoE expects around 5.5 million employees will need support from this programme during an England-wide lockdown this month, up from just over 2 million in October.

Sunak's critics have said a series of U-turns over employment support policy made it hard for companies to plan ahead at the expense of many jobs.

1229,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 10, 2020 12:09AM ET</span>",Chinese Inflation Indexes Disappoint Versus Overall Economic Recovery,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Chinese factory-gate prices saw sharper-than-expected falls in October, with weak fuel demand counterbalancing recoveries in the trade and manufacturing sectors from their COVID-19-induced slump.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day showed a Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) disappointing expectations. CPI grew 0.5% year-on-year, against the 0.8% in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and September’s 1.7%, the slowest growth since October 2009. It contracted 0.3% month-on-month, tumbling below the forecast and September’s 0.2% growth.
The PPI contracted 2.1% year-on-year, missing the forecast contraction of 2.0% but remaining level with September’s 2.1% contraction.
Consumer inflation also slumped to a 11-year low, with pork prices halting a 19-month-long period of increases. The long period of growth is attributable to a shortage of the meat, which is popular throughout the country, due to African swine fever. Prices fell 2.8% year-on-year in October, compared to the 25.5% increase in September.
Oil and gas extraction prices fell 4.9% month-on-month in October while fuel processing costs declined 1.6%, NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement.
Although the weak readings largely reflect swings in volatile items, they also suggest that upstream demand for industrial goods remains weak overall, despite recent signs of small improvements.
However, some investors remained optimistic, with the Chinese economy expected to post a modest gain for the full year, then gather speed in 2021 over cautious hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine will be made available globally by then.
“We expect both CPI and PPI to be subdued in the fourth quarter … however, inflation will likely rebound after Q1 2021, thanks to the growing post-pandemic demand,” ANZ markets economist Zhaopeng Xing told Reuters.
“Consumer price inflation looks set to drop back further in the near-term as pork supply continues to recover from last year’s African swine fever outbreak,” Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said in a note after the data release, striking a more cautious note than Xing.
“Policymakers are likely to look through the volatility in food prices and focus on the recovery in underlying inflation. As such, we don’t think low headline inflation will prevent the People’s Bank (of China) from raising interest rates next year,” the note added.
The data follows Monday’s trade data, which showed that exports rose 11.45% year-on-year and the trade balance rose to $58.44 billion, but that imports rose 4.9% year-on-year, down from the predicted growth of 9.5% and September's 13.2% reading."

1231,By Bloomberg,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 07:54PM ET</span>",Australian Business Confidence Jumps to Highest Since Mid-2019,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian business confidence surged to the highest level since May 2019 as firms took heart from declining Covid infections and the southeastern state of Victoria emerged from one of the world’s strictest lockdowns.
Sentiment climbed to 5 points in October from -4 a month earlier, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY) Ltd. said Tuesday in a statement. The conditions index -- which measures hiring, sales and profits -- edged up to 1 from zero in September.
“This was likely driven by the fall in Covid-19 case numbers and looming end of lockdown in Melbourne,” said Alan Oster, chief economist at NAB. “Trading conditions and profitability drove the marginal improvement in conditions, but the employment index remains weak at -5 index points, suggesting the labor market is lagging the recovery in activity.”
Australia’s central bank predicts unemployment will peak at just under 8% in the next couple of months from 6.9% at present. It last week unveiled a new monetary stimulus package that saw interest rates cut to 0.10% and added a A$100 billion ($72.8 billion) program to buy longer-dated bonds to the existing three-year yield control target.
The central bank’s efforts are working with substantial fiscal stimulus released in the government’s budget that included income-tax cuts and incentives for business to invest and hire. The economy’s outlook has improved as Victoria state emerges from a sever lockdown to contain Covid, with job ads, sentiment and house prices all improving.
“The survey continues to show that the economy has rebounded from the sharp fall in activity in the first half of 2020 and will likely continue to recover as the economy reopens,” Oster said. “The improvement in confidence is encouraging but remains fragile, and it will likely remain that way until a vaccine is available.”
NAB’s survey of more than 400 firms was conducted Oct. 22-30.

1232,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","U.S. consumers' views on labor market mixed, New York Fed survey shows","(Reuters) - U.S. consumers reported mixed feelings about the labor market in October as the outlook for unemployment improved but the perceived odds of finding new work after losing a job dropped to a six-year low, according to a survey released on Monday by the New York Federal Reserve.
The regional Fed bank's latest Survey of Consumer Expectations found gradual improvement in optimism about the labor market, with the average expectation that the unemployment rate could be higher one year from now dropping for the third consecutive month. 
The perceived odds of losing a job in the next 12 months also dropped to 15.5% in October from 16.6% in September, but were still above the pre-pandemic level of 13.8% in February. The drop was largest among people with higher levels of education and those earning more than $50,000.
At the same time, consumers across education and income levels said they worried it would be harder to find a new job if they became unemployed. The perceived odds of finding new work dropped to 46.9% in October from 49.9% in September - the lowest level since April 2014. 
Data released by the Labor Department on Friday showed that new hiring continued to slow in October and more people faced long-term joblessness, but the unemployment rate also fell to 6.9%, a bigger drop than expected by analysts, and more people entered the labor force.
The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll conducted on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

In other aspects of their finances, fewer people said they expected their situation to improve over the next year and more said they expected it to worsen. Consumers said they were less worried about missing a minimum debt payment over the next three months, but also felt it would become harder to access credit over the next year.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's exports rose in October for the fourth consecutive month and at an expectation-beating pace, boosted by surging demand for the island's electronic goods as people work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exports jumped 11.2% from a year earlier to $32.2 billion inOctober, a record high for any month, the Ministry of Finance said on Monday, and the strongest growth since February. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a modest rise of 4.2% for October.
The ministry attributed the growth to ongoing strong demand for electronics, driven by new technology such as fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications networks and telecommuting, as millions of people are forced to work from home globally.
Healthy demand for electronics ahead of the year-end shopping season, traditionally a busy time for Taiwan's exporters, also boosted export growth, the ministry said.
Exports of telecommuting products - such as wireless keyboards and headphones - rose 20.8% from a year earlier to a record high for any month, while electronic components grew 21.8% and semiconductors rose 22.2%.
The ministry said it saw a ""comprehensive expansion"" in exports to all of Taiwan's major markets. Exports to the United States and Japan both reached record highs by value, growing an annual 21.4% and 4.8% respectively.
Tech powerhouse Taiwan could see November exports rise in the range of a 5% to 8% on year, the ministry said.
However, it said the rebounding pandemic, with renewed lockdowns in some countries, as well as U.S.-China trade tension offered uncertainty going forward.
Taiwan's October imports fell 1%, against economists' expectations for a 2.5% decrease.
Taiwan's manufacturers are a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL).

In China, Taiwan's largest trading partner, exports grew at the fastest pace in 19 months in October, while imports also rose, official data showed on Saturday.

Seasonally adjusted exports rose 2.3% on the month after an upwardly revised 2.9% rise in August, the Federal Statistics Office said. Imports fell by 0.1% after a rise of 5.8% the previous month. The trade surplus expanded to 17.8 billion euros, the Office said.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports to rise by 2.0% and imports to increase by 2.1%. The trade surplus was predicted to come in at 15.8 billion euros.
""Looking ahead, exports (and industrial production) could still prevent the economy from falling into a second lockdown depression in the final quarter of the year,"" ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.
""With U.S. President-elect Biden, the threat of U.S. tariffs on European (read German) automotives should disappear,"" he added.
The economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter on higher consumer spending and exports, but an aggressive second wave of infections and a new partial lockdown are now clouding the outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond.
Annual figures showed exports to China rose 10.6% from the previous September. Exports to the United States, which the Office said were particularly affected by the coronavirus pandemic, fell 5.8% on the year and those to the UK fell 12.4%.
A picture is emerging of German industry growing despite the pandemic, while services struggle. Industrial output rose in September, data showed on Friday.
A survey released last Wednesday showed that German services activity shrank for the first time in four months in October.

Germany closed bars, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theatres and domestic tourism last Monday for a month to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A key Japanese economic indicator improved for the fourth straight month in September, suggesting relief is at hand for an economy still feeling the drag from the coronavirus pandemic.
The index of coincident economic indicators - calculated off a range of data including factory output, employment and retail sales numbers - rose a preliminary 1.4 points from the previous month to 80.8 in September, the Cabinet Office said on Monday.
The government said that the index in September indicated economic activity had stopped contracting, leaving unchanged its August assessment.
The data takes some pressure off the government to speed up the recovery of the economy, which is feeling the drag from weak business and household spending.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to announce a plan for extra stimulus measures to help the economy overcome the COVID-19 crisis, government and ruling party sources told Reuters last month.
The figure also came after the Bank of Japan upgraded its view on the recovery outlook at its policy meeting last month, signalling that it has delivered enough stimulus for now.
The index for leading economic indicators, which is a gauge of the economy a few months ahead and is compiled using data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, soared 4.4 points to 92.9 from August, its biggest rise since a 5.4-point jump in June.

Gross domestic product data for the third quarter due on Nov. 16 is expected to show the economy rebounded from a record slump, thanks largely to a recovery in exports and output.

1236,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 09, 2020 12:08AM ET</span>","China Releases Strong Trade Data, But Decreased Imports Remain a Challenge","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – China continued its economic recovery from the COVID-19 lockdown imposed earlier in the year, but the incessantly rising number of COVID-19 cases globally saw a smaller-than-forecast growth in imports.
Data for October released on Sunday showed that exports rose 11.45% year-on-year, exceeding the 9.3% growth in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and September’s 9.9% reading. The trade balance rose to $58.44 billion, smashing both September’s $37 billion and the forecast $46 billion.
Although imports rose 4.9% year-on-year, down from the predicted growth of 9.5% and September's 13.2% reading, “a second straight monthly expansion suggests a continuous rebound in domestic demand,” according to Bloomberg Economics.
With Europe and the U.S. fighting a second wave of COVID-19 cases, exports benefitted from increased demand from a global rush to secure medical equipment and work-from-home technology as countries such as France, Germany and the U.K. re-enter lockdowns.
However, with the global number of cases now exceeding 50 million as of Nov. 9, with almost 10 million cases in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University, the fight against COVID-19 continues, dampening global demand. Domestically, a case was detected in the city of Tianjin on Sunday.
With Sunday’s confirmation of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory in the U.S. presidential elections, investors widely expect a less confrontational approach to U.S.-China relations from the new administration. Incumbent president Donald Trump has so far refused to concede and continues to pursue legal action.
Inflation and credit reports, including the Consumer Price Index, due to be released tomorrow are also widely expected to indicate stable underlying demand. Investors also await the results of the Singles Day shopping event, involving e-commerce giants such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), on Nov. 11."
1237,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers' less pessimistic in November: Reuters Tankan,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Business sentiment of Japanese manufacturers and service-sector firms was the least pessimistic in nine months in November, likely as the world's third-largest economy showed signs of pulling out of a coronavirus-induced recession, a Reuters poll showed on Monday.
But both sectors believed conditions will remain negative over the coming months, highlighting the struggle to completely shake off the drag from COVID-19, according to the monthly Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
In the poll of 485 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 225 firms responded on condition of anonymity, many complained about the pandemic's lingering impact, and negative comments about business conditions outnumbered positive ones. 
""Conditions haven't returned to what they were before the coronavirus pandemic,"" a manager at a textile maker said in the survey.
The result underscores the challenge Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga faces in boosting domestic demand to assure an economic recovery while keeping the spread of the virus in check.
Suga is expected to announce this month a plan for fresh stimulus to boost activity, government and ruling party sources have told Reuters.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers showed a marked improvement in November, rising to minus 13 from minus 26 in the previous month. But the index remained in negative territory for a 16th straight month.
The service-sector index was also minus 13, up from minus 16 in October, with sentiment among wholesalers weighing on broad business confidence.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
The results meant both indexes came in at their least pessimistic since February.
The BOJ cut its economic growth and inflation forecasts for the current fiscal year and offered a brighter view on the recovery outlook at its policy meeting last month, signalling that it has done enough on the stimulus front for now.
But it also warned the outlook was highly uncertain as the pandemic weighs on service-sector spending and a resurgence of infections in Europe dampen prospects for a sustained global recovery. 
In the Reuters Tankan survey, a manager at a machinery maker wrote: ""The semiconductor memory market, which had been strong so far, has slowed down somewhat.""

Manufacturers' sentiment was seen recovering further to minus 8 in February, while that of service-sector firms was expected to remain unchanged at minus 13.

Exports in October rose 11.4% from a year earlier, beating analysts' expectations of a 9.3% increase and quickening from a solid 9.9% increase in September.
The surge in exports pushed the trade surplus for October up to $58.44 billion, compared with the poll's forecast for a $46 billion surplus and a $37 billion surplus in September.
China's trade surplus with the United States widened to $31.37 billion in October from $30.75 billion in September.
China's exports have stayed largely resilient amid the COVID-19 global pandemic, as strong demand for medical supplies and reduced manufacturing capacity elsewhere worked in China's favour.
""Exports growth quickened further and significantly exceeded expectations, indicating a relatively strong momentum,"" said Liu Xuezhi, an anlyst at Bank of Communications in Shanghai.
China's exports could stay strong in the rest of 2020 as domestic firms resume production faster than global rivals and sell more COVID-19 related goods such as face masks, Liu said.
However, some analysts said exports could come under pressure in the coming months, as major European economies, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, went back into lockdown as a second wave of coronavirus cases gathered strength.Factory activity accelerated at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in October, a private survey showed, although the official survey pointed to some slowdown in the expansion. Export orders expanded.
Imports rose 4.7% year-on-year in October, slower than September's 13.2% growth, and underperforming expectations in a Reuters poll for a 9.5% increase, but still marking a second straight month of growth.
Chinese airlines are shunning some deliveries of Airbus (PA:AIR) aircraft, citing fears of coronavirus infection for their staff in the latest tussle over efforts to keep delayed deliveries on track despite the pandemic, industry sources said.
Analysts said the solid trade performance could provide a boost to China's broader economic recovery, which has gained steam after suffering from a deep slump earlier this year.
China's economy grew 4.9% in the third-quarter from a year earlier, but growth could slow to just over 2% this year - the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies.
""China has a better recovery from the pandemic and has a comparative advantage, so it has gained a larger market,"" said Zhou Hao, an economist at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) in Singapore.
""Of course, this advantage is also temporary and may last until the end of the year.""

The Commerce Department said wholesale inventories gained 0.4% in September, instead of dipping 0.1% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers increased 0.5% in August. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product rose 0.4% in September.
Inventories were down 3.9% in September from a year earlier.
Gross domestic product rebounded at a historic 33.1% annualized growth rate in the third quarter. That followed a 31.4% rate of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created the fewest jobs in five months in October and more Americans are working part time, the clearest evidence yet that the recovery from the pandemic recession was slowing as fiscal stimulus ends and new COVID-19 cases explode. 
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday also showed 3.6 million people were out of work for more then six months, underscoring the challenges the next president, whether it is incumbent Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden, confronts to keep the economy growing as it heals from the deepest recession since the Great Depression.
Biden edged closer to winning the White House early on Friday as he took a narrow lead over Trump in the battleground state of Georgia. Trump on Thursday alleged fraud without providing evidence, filing lawsuits and calling for recounts in a race yet to be decided since polls closed on Tuesday.
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 638,000 jobs last month after rising by 672,000 in September. That was the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May and left employment 10.1 million below its peak in February. A 271,000 increase in leisure and hospitality jobs accounted for about two-fifths of the payrolls gain last month.
Employment in professional and business services increased by 208,000, with about half of the job gains in temporary help services. Government payrolls fell 268,000, weighed down by the departure of temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census and further job losses at cash-strapped state and local governments.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls advancing by 600,000 jobs in October. 
A contested election reduces the chances of another coronavirus rescue package from the government this year. Even if more fiscal policy is agreed on, it will likely be smaller than had been anticipated before the election. 
That will shift the spotlight to the Federal Reserve. The U.S. central bank kept interest rates near zero on Thursday. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market had moderated, noting that the recovery would be stronger with more fiscal support.
U.S. stocks took a breather on Friday after surging more than 7% this week. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
LONG BOUTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers fueled a historic 33.1% annualized rate of economic growth in the third quarter. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter. 
Lack of fiscal stimulus and spiraling new coronavirus infections across the country have put the economy on a sharply slower growth path heading into the fourth quarter. Restaurants and gyms have moved outdoors, but cooler weather and the resurgence in COVID-19 infections could leave many in trouble.
Even if states and local governments do not impose new restrictions on businesses, consumers are likely to stay away, fearing exposure to the respiratory illness. The United States set a one-day record for new coronavirus cases on Wednesday with at least 102,591 infections, according to a Reuters tally.
Though small and medium-sized businesses have suffered most from the pandemic, large corporations have not been spared.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) last month announced 1,900 layoffs in the United States. Boeing (NYSE:BA) said it expected to eliminate about 30,000 jobs, 11,000 more than previously planned, by end-2021.
The unemployment rate fell to 6.9% from 7.9% in September. But it continued to be biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Without this recurring mistake, the government said the jobless rate would have been about 7.2% in October. 
While the unemployment rate has dropped from a peak of 14.7% in April, that is not a true reflection of the labor market's health. The number of people out of work for more than six months surged by 1.2 million to 3.6 million in October.
The number of people working part time for economic reasons increased by 383,000 to 6.7 million, reflecting reduced hours because of slack work or business conditions.

At least 21.5 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in mid-October. Many people, mostly women, have dropped out of the labor force to look after children or because they fear contracting the virus.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy created a net 638,000 nonfarm jobs in the month through mid-October, in a stronger-than-expected start to a quarter that looks set to be overshadowed by the spreading Covid-19 pandemic.
Nonfarm payrolls had been expected to rise by 600,000. As such the actual number represents only a modest slowdown in job creation from an upwardly-revised 672,000 in September. 
The unemployment rate fell by a full percentage point to 6.9% of the workforce.
The report is a sign of the labor market's resilience in the face of rising coronavirus cases, all the more so since 147,000 jobs tied to the 2020 census were lost during the month. Most encouragingly, the labor force participation rate rose to 61.7% of the population, having fallen to a four-month low of 61.4% in September. That may alleviate concerns that the improvement in the headline jobless numbers are due above all to people giving up the hunt for work.
U.S. stock futures responded brightly to the numbers, with Dow Jones Futures rising some 0.5% in the 15 minutes after the release.

Average house prices rose 7.5% in October from a year earlier to a record average of 250,457 pounds ($329,000), mortgage lender Halifax said Friday. On the month alone, prices gained 0.3%.
The property market has defied a general economic downturn since the virus hit as city dwellers looked to move out of urban centers. The government is also fueling demand with a temporary tax break on purchases and by promising more generous loans for young buyers.
Under the new lockdown that took effect this week, house viewings are still allowed and real estate agents remain open for business.
The boom may be short-lived. Rising unemployment and a new lockdown this month will make it harder for transactions to go through. The Bank of England expanded monetary stimulus Thursday as it lowered forecasts for growth.
“While government support measures have undoubtedly helped to delay the expected downturn in the housing market, they will not continue indefinitely,” said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax. “With a number of clear headwinds facing the housing market, we expect to see greater downward pressure on house prices as we move into 2021.”

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose by less than expected in September as the coronavirus crisis held back activity, data showed on Friday, suggesting Europe's largest economy may not have the strength of avoid a double dip.
Industrial output increased by 1.6% on the month, figures released by the Federal Statistics Office showed. A Reuters poll had forecast a rise of 2.7%. 
The rise was driven by a rebound in the auto industry, Germany's largest manufacturing sector, which saw output rise by 10.0% in September after a decline of 10.3% in August.
""The manufacturing sector is gradually fighting back,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement.
""New orders and the business climate suggest that the recovery process will continue, even if this path will become even more rocky in view of the pandemic,"" it added.
The economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter on higher consumer spending and exports, but an aggressive second wave of infections and a new partial lockdown are now clouding the outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond.
A picture is emerging of German industry growing despite the pandemic, while services struggle.
A survey released on Wednesday showed that German services activity shrank for the first time in four months in October, a sign the economy was struggling even before the partial lockdown was imposed.
ING economist Carsten Brzeski expected industry to give the economy momentum going into the fourth quarter, but said new lockdown measures and weaker demand from other euro zone countries meant ""this positive momentum will in our view not be enough to avoid (a) double dip for the German economy"".
Other recent German data have pointed to a fading recovery.
Industrial orders grew less than expected in September as euro zone orders dropped, data showed on Thursday.Business morale fell for the first time in six months in October due to concerns about rising virus infection rates.
The Ifo economic institute said earlier on Friday that production expectations for Germany's industrial sector have weakened somewhat for the coming months, adding that it was unclear what impact lockdown measures would have.
Germany closed bars, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theatres and domestic tourism on Monday for a month to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Its index for production prospects dropped to 17.4 points in October from 20.0 points in September, having previously risen for months.

In October, exports are expected to have risen 9.3% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 20 economists, down slightly from the 9.9% gain in September. 
Imports likely rose 9.5% on year, which economists regarded as a solid increase though it would be slower than in September, when imports rebounded 13.2%.
China's trade surplus is expected to have widened to $46 billion in October from $37 billion in September, according to the poll. 
The forecasts could suggest the recovery in the world's second-largest economy from the initial impact of the coronavirus pandemic remains intact.
China's economy is expected to expand around 2% this year - the weakest in over three decades but still much stronger than other major economies as it emerged faster from the coronavirus crisis, having been the first country to be hit by the pandemic. 
The upward momentum was also evident in China's official manufacturing survey for October, as the new export orders sub-index expanded at a quicker pace.
Analysts at Nomura said in a research note that a pause in the re-opening of some overseas economies due to a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and a high base last year would have weighed on October's import growth. They also expected less growth in crude oil imports.
Some analysts also noted there were fewer working days last month compared with same period last year due to the long national holiday, which might lead to a slightly softer reading.
And they said China's trade performance could suffer over the next few months as stringent virus control measures are re-imposed by trade partners due to recent resurgence of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the United States.

Some companies reported that second wave in infections abroad had lengthened procurement periods for imports of raw materials and increased transport costs.

Xi told the Communist Party’s Central Committee last week the economy could double in size by 2035, according to state media. That would imply an annual average growth rate of 4.7%-5%, according to a range of forecasts from economists.
Read more: Xi Says Economy Can Double as China Lays Out Ambitious Plans
The Chinese leader was addressing the party’s top decision makers at a closed-door meeting in which they laid out plans for the economy over the next five and 15 years. Officials didn’t disclose a numerical growth goal, although the economic planning agency has said it’s working on five-year targets. Reuters reported that officials are considering a goal of around 5% growth a year.
“Keeping growth above 4.5% for another 15 years is more ambitious for China than many assume,” Capital Economics Ltd. economists, led by Julian Evans-Pritchard, wrote in a note. With the external environment likely to be even more challenging in the coming decade, and returns to capital accumulation diminishing, China would need faster productivity gains, they said.
China is likely to announce more specific targets when the plan is officially adopted by the national parliament, expected in March next year.
Growth Estimates
When the last five-year plan was released in 2015, Xi’s speech to the Central Committee disclosed a growth goal of at least 6.5% over the period. This year, the only hints economists have are his broad ambition of doubling gross domestic product in 15 years and the plan’s mention of raising GDP per capita to the level of a “medium developed country.”
Read more: China Pledges Quality Growth, Tech Powerhouse in 5-Year Plan
Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. in Hong Kong, says the Communist Party’s commentary so far suggests an annual average growth of 4.73% over the next 15 years, which he breaks down as follows: an 8.7% surge next year from a low base in 2020; an average expansion of 5.3% in 2022-2025, 4.5% in 2026-2030 and 3.7% in 2031-2035.
With China’s potential growth gradually slowing as the economy matures, growth of 4.7%-5% may still be too ambitious. The government’s current aim is to double the size of GDP and income by 2020 from the level in 2010, but doubling it again from a bigger base may be harder to achieve.
U.S. Tensions
The nation also faces an aging population, rising wages and a rapid increase in debt, all of which could hurt its growth potential. That’s not even counting a more hostile global environment as rivals like the U.S. seek to curb China’s trade and technology ambitions.
“It is extremely difficult to project growth 15 years out and, although we view growth of 5%-6% over 2021-2025 as likely, growth above 5% over 2026-2035 appears quite challenging,”  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc. economists, led by Ting Lu, wrote in a note.
To overcome some of those challenges, the Communist Party is promising to build the nation into a technological powerhouse and focus on quality growth over speed. Key to that objective is developing a robust domestic market and becoming self-reliant in technology -- especially in chips, the building blocks for innovations from artificial intelligence to fifth-generation networking and autonomous vehicles.
What Bloomberg Economics Says...
The five-year plan “outlined a range of areas that need to be tackled to achieve higher-quality development, from strengthening the economic structure with a higher-end industrial base to raising household incomes, environmental standards, education levels and the quality of public services.”
“These would move China’s economy in the right direction. The key, as always, will be effective execution and enforcement.”

1247,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 08:40PM ET</span>","Japan's household spending, wages slump as COVID-19 pain lingers","By Leika Kihara and Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending slumped in September from a year earlier and real wages slid for the seventh straight month, data showed on Friday, a sign sluggish domestic demand will continue to drag on any recovery in the world's third-largest economy.
The data underscores the challenge authorities face in balancing the need to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and reviving economic activity.
Household spending fell 10.2% in September from a year earlier, marking the fourth biggest drop on record and roughly matching a median market forecast for a 10.7% fall, government data showed. It followed a 6.9% drop in August.
Providing some optimism, however, spending rose 3.8% from the previous month, suggesting households were gradually adjusting to life under the pandemic.
""Spending on services recovered in September as people appear to have become used to dealing with COVID-19,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi life Research Institute.
""We expect consumer spending to pick up gradually, though a possible resurgence in infections is a risk,"" he said.
The year-on-year decline was partly driven by the high base effect from September last year, when consumers rushed to buy goods to beat a sales tax hike in October 2019.
Spending on services continued to fall, though the pace of decline slowed from August for some items such as travel and transportation fees, the data showed.
In a sign sliding income could dent consumption, however, real wages - a key barometer of households' purchasing power - declined 1.1% in September from a year earlier.
Overtime pay and bonuses slumped in September as companies slashed costs to weather the hit to profits from COVID-19.
Japan's economy is bottoming out after suffering its worst postwar slump in April-June, thanks in part to a rebound in exports and output. But weak consumption and capital spending is likely to keep any economic recovery modest, analysts say.
With the Bank of Japan left with little ammunition to spur growth, the onus is on the government to deploy more fiscal stimulus to cushion the blow from the pandemic, they say.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to announce this month a plan for fresh stimulus to help the economy shake off the crisis, sources have told Reuters.

""Overcoming this coronavirus crisis and reviving Japan's economy remain our top priority,"" he told parliament on Friday.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims drop modestly; labor market recovery cooling,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell only slightly last week, adding to signs that the economic recovery was losing steam as the COVID-19 pandemic intensifies and fiscal stimulus ends.
The economy could be plunged into a period of uncertainty following Tuesday's presidential election, potentially undermining business investment and delaying a much-needed second coronavirus relief package from the government. 
Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to victory on Thursday, while President Donald Trump alleged fraud without providing evidence, filing lawsuits and calling for recounts in a race yet to be decided two days after polls closed.
""It looks like a second wave of layoffs is hitting the economy perhaps due to the rising count of virus cases, but it could also mean that many businesses are unable to reopen fully and facing bankruptcy, so they have to let their workers go,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 751,000 for the week ended Oct. 31, the Labor Department said. Data for the prior week was revised to show 7,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 732,000 applications in the latest week. Claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March. 
The weekly unemployment claims report, the most timely data on the economy's health, followed on the heels of reports on Wednesday showing private payrolls increasing less than expected in October and activity in the services industry cooling.
With a swift fiscal package unlikely as politics take center-stage, the focus will shift to the Federal Reserve to pump more money into the economy. The U.S. central bank maintained its ultra easy monetary policy stance on Thursday and pledged again to do whatever it can in coming months to sustain the recovery.
Unadjusted claims edged down 543 to 738,166 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.1 million people filed claims last week.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors bet on a Republican-held Senate that would block any moves by a Biden administration to tighten regulation and raise taxes. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.

LACKLUSTER DEMAND
More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers fueled a historic 33.1% annualized rate of economic growth in the third quarter. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter. 
Lack of fiscal stimulus and spiraling new coronavirus infections across the country have put the economy on a sharply slower growth path heading into the fourth quarter. Restaurants and gyms have moved outdoors, but cooler weather and the explosion of COVID-19 cases could leave many in trouble.
The services industry, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, has been hardest hit by the pandemic, making it difficult to recoup all the 22.2 million jobs lost during the crisis. 
The government's closely watched employment report on Friday is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 600,000 jobs in October after rising 661,000 in September, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave employment 10.1 million jobs below its peak in February. 
Though the claims report showed a decline in the number of people on unemployment rolls in late October, that was partly because many people have exhausted their six months of benefits.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 538,000 to 7.285 million in the week ending Oct. 24. A total 3.961 million filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Oct. 17. At least 21.5 million people were receiving unemployment benefits in mid-October.
In another report on Thursday, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at a 4.9% annualized rate last quarter. Productivity surged at a 10.6% rate in the second quarter, the fastest since the first quarter of 1971. It rose at a 4.1% rate compared to the third quarter of 2019. 
Though productivity was likely distorted by the pandemic, the two straight quarters of strong gains mirror a pattern seen during the 2007-09 recession when the recovery was not accompanied by strong employment growth.
The economy has recouped two-thirds of output lost during the COVID-19 pandemic, while just over half of the jobs that disappeared have been recovered. 

""Though we are on track for GDP next year to recoup all of the drop during the recession, the labor market will take longer,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

1249,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 08:31AM ET</span>","U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Fell to 751,000 Last Week; 732k Expected","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The number of Americans filing initial claims for state jobless benefits last week fell by less than expected to 751,000, in a further sign of the pressure on the labor market as a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections hits the U.S. economy.
Economists had expected a drop to 732,000. Last week's figure was revised upwards by a little under 1% to 758,000, according to Labor Department data released on Thursday.
The number of continuing claims fell by some 560,000 to 7.285 million, also a little higher than forecast.
The initial claims figure is still close to its lowest since late March, when the first wave of layoffs related to Covid-19 lockdowns struck the U.S. economy. However, it's still over three times the rate that claims had run at before the pandemic, and points to ongoing high levels of layoffs, even at the end of the summer in which the economy had recovered strongly from its initial setback.
The total number of people claiming benefits in all programs for the week ending October 17 was 21.508 million, a decrease of 1.15 million from the previous week. While some of that reflects rehiring across the economy, it also reflects an increasing number of people who have lost eligibility for benefits under certain programs, or who have simply left the workforce.
The numbers come against a backdrop of growing evidence that the economy is starting to lose momentum again as the pandemic regains strength at the start of winter. On Wednesday, payrolls processor ADP estimated that only a net 365,000 people found private-sector jobs in the month to October 17, barely half the previous month's job gains. 
""People are cutting their social interactions, hurting the leisure and hospitality sectors quite badly. This is not going to get better anytime soon,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note after the ADP report.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",UK construction PMI falls to five-month low despite strong house-building,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's construction sector lost momentum in October but suffered less than the most of the coronavirus-hit economy thanks to a buoyant housing market, a business survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index for the construction sector dropped to 53.1 in October from September's 56.8, a bigger drop than the decline to 55.0 which economists had forecast in a Reuters poll, and its lowest since May.
However, unlike figures released on Wednesday for the much larger services sector, the gauge remained well above the 50 level which separates growth from contraction.
""The construction sector was a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy month for the UK economy during October,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
House-building was the biggest contributor to growth, reflecting a boom in demand since the end of lockdown, helped by a temporary cut in property taxes which has seen lenders approve the highest number of mortgages since 2007.
New orders in the sector, which makes up about 6% of Britain's economy, rose by the most in five years.
The construction industry is also exempt from the four-week lockdown which started in England on Thursday -- although firms last month were concerned about the potential knock-on effects on demand from rising COVID-19 cases.
""Survey respondents widely commented on renewed economic uncertainty and concerns about the sustainability of the recovery as pent-up demand begins to wane,"" Moore said.

The civil engineering sector continued to report steep declines in activity, while growth in commercial activity was fairly muted.

Industrial orders rose 0.5% in September, less than the 2% analysts had expected, partly because bookings from other members of euro zone fell by 6%, offsetting expansion in both Germany and the rest of the world.
A purchasing managers' survey from earlier this week showed that though manufacturing in the euro zone was booming, it was almost entirely driven by Germany's recovery, highlighting the economic behemoth's vulnerability to its neighbours' economic weakness.
Growth slowed from the previous month, when orders were up a revised 4.9% as the economy recovered from the earlier lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the pandemic.
In September, domestic orders rose 2.3% on the month and those from the rest of the world by 2.7%.
""After a first strong recovery following the lockdown in April, industry continues to fight its way out of the crisis,"" the Economy Ministry said, hailing the data - which showed the fifth expansion in a row - as a positive signal.
Orders were up a full 29.1% in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter, the ministry said. Domestic demand rose 15.5%, euro zone demand 41.0% and demand from the rest of the world 40.4%.

Last week, data showed the German economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter as higher consumer spending and exports helped it recover partly from its worst-ever recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased less than expected in October and activity in the services industry cooled, providing early signs of a slowdown in economic growth as fiscal stimulus diminishes and new COVID-19 infections surge across the country.
The recovery from the coronavirus pandemic could also be impacted over the next few months by political uncertainty following Tuesday's cliffhanger presidential election, which economists warned could cause businesses to be more cautious about spending decisions. 
The election hung in the balance on Wednesday, with a handful of close-fought states set to decide the outcome in the coming hours or days. There are fears of a contested result between President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden, who both still have possible paths to reach the needed 270 Electoral College votes to win the White House.
""This is not a good outcome for the economy since the headwinds from rising Covid cases, troubled state and local government finances and falling incomes as unemployment benefits expire, are growing in strength,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. 
""Animosity and the threat of legal challenges argues against a swift fiscal support package which will be a concern as activity becomes increasingly constrained.""
Private payrolls increased by 365,000 jobs last month after rising 753,000 in September, the ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would advance by 650,000 in October.
Job gains last month were broad, though they were concentrated in industries directly impacted by the coronavirus crisis, including the leisure and hospitality sector. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the country could lead to renewed business restrictions to slow the spread of the respiratory illness as winter approaches. 
Even without new restrictions, Americans are likely to stay away from air travel, hotels, gyms, bars, restaurants and other consumer-facing businesses, worsening already lackluster demand, which has seen the labor market struggling to recoup all the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Though it has fallen short of the government's private payrolls count since May because of methodology differences, it is still watched for clues on the labor market's health.
It was released ahead of the government's closely watched, and comprehensive, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, private nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 700,000 jobs in October after rising 877,000 in September. 
With government payrolls expected to have dropped again last month as more temporary workers hired for the Census departed and state and local governments struggle with tight budgets, overall nonfarm payrolls are forecast increasing by 600,000 jobs after rising 661,000 in September. That would leave employment 10.1 million jobs below its peak in February.
GRIDLOCK
Surprisingly, U.S. financial markets were mostly higher despite the political uncertainty. Stocks on Wall Street rose. U.S. Treasury prices were higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. 
""My sense is traders and investors are increasingly comfortable Republicans will hold the Senate and Democrats will hold the House,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""From a markets standpoint, that means whoever emerges with White House control, Trump or Biden, will not be able to do much.""
A survey from the Institute for Supply Management on Wednesday showed its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 56.6 in October from 57.8 in September, falling back below its 57.3 level in February. 
The survey's measure of services industry employment slipped to 50.1 from a reading of 51.8 in September, consistent with views that the labor market was stalling after being boosted by more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief for businesses and workers, which is now gone.
That is consistent with analysts' expectations for a step-down in economic growth in the fourth quarter after a historic 33.1% annualized rate of expansion in the third quarter. The economy contracted at a record 31.4% pace in the April-June quarter.
A third report from the Commerce Department showed the trade deficit fell 4.7% to $63.9 billion in September as food exports jumped to the highest level since July 2012, boosted by shipments of soybeans. Economists had forecast the trade shortfall narrowing to $63.8 billion in September.
Goods exports rose 3.1% to $122.8 billion, also lifted by telecommunications equipment, industrial engines and computer accessories. Exports to China were the highest since March 2018. New COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe could curb export gains.
Goods imports climbed 0.3% to $203.5 billion, the highest level since December 2019. Food imports were the highest on record in September. The nation also imported more capital goods, automotive vehicles, parts and engines. 

Imports from China were the highest since July 2019. The United States imported 157.9 million barrels of crude oil in September, the fewest since February 1992.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain looks on course to enter a double-dip recession this winter, as business surveys show economic growth almost halted last month even before the latest England-wide lockdown was announced, financial data company IHS Markit said.
The IHS Markit/CIPS services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to a four-month low of 51.4 in October from 56.1 in September, closer to the 50 mark that represents zero growth than an initial reading of 52.3.
The composite PMI, which includes stronger manufacturing data released on Monday, sank to 52.1 from 56.5, also weaker than the initial 'flash' estimate.
""October data indicates that the UK service sector was close to stalling even before the announcement of lockdown 2 in England,"" IHS Markit economist Tim Moore said.
""The UK economy seems on course for a double-dip recession this winter and a far more challenging path to recovery in 2021,"" he added.
The new orders component in the services PMI fell sharply, and businesses shed jobs for the eighth month in a row.
From Thursday all non-essential shops, pubs and restaurants in England will close for four weeks, except where they serve takeaway food.
The restrictions are less wide-ranging than in March and April, but some economists have predicted output in November will fall by as much as 10%, reducing output for the fourth quarter by around 3%.
British gross domestic product slumped by 20% during the longer lockdown in the second quarter of 2020, the biggest decline of any major advanced economy.
The Bank of England looks set to launch another round of bond purchases on Thursday and downgrade its economic forecasts from those it gave in August, when it predicted GDP would be back to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2021.

Since then, COVID-19 cases have risen sharply in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, and Britain's government fears hospitals will be overwhelmed if it cannot slow the disease's spread.

Alongside their peers, Germany and France -- the 19-country bloc's two biggest economies -- have reimposed tough lockdown measures, likely dealing a heavy blow this month as restaurants, gyms and shops remain closed and citizens stay at home.
""With lockdown measures being tightened, it is becoming increasingly hard to see how the euro zone economy will avoid falling back into decline,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at survey compiler IHS Markit. 
""For all countries the outlook has grown increasingly dark.""
The euro zone economy contracted 11.8% in the second quarter but expanded a much-better-than-expected 12.7% in July-September after many lockdown restrictions were eased, official data showed on Friday.
But rising coronavirus cases pose a serious risk to the bloc's recovery, a Reuters poll said last month, and IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, dropped to 50.0 last month from September's 50.4, although above a preliminary reading of 49.4. [ECILT/EU]
That was bang on the 50 mark which separates growth from contraction and was dragged down by the services PMI which fell to 46.9 from 48.0, its lowest since May when the first wave of the virus was sweeping across Europe.
""Service providers have been hit especially hard, led by intensifying weakness in consumer-facing sectors such as hospitality, offsetting the brighter news seen in manufacturing during the month,"" Williamson said. [EU/PMIM]
The IHS Markit survey was conducted largely before many of the new restrictions were put in place across Europe but forward-looking indicators were already bleak.
Services firms cut headcount for an eighth month, demand dropped further, backlogs of work were again depleted and optimism waned. The business expectations index sank to 54.2 from 59.2, and it has mostly only ever been lower this year and during the last two financial crises.
To offer support, the European Central Bank committed last week to take new action in December to contain the growing fallout, having already pumped in unprecedented stimulus.
The Bank's policy mandate is to have inflation just below 2% but it registered -0.3% in October, official flash data showed, so policymakers are likely to be disappointed to see firms cutting prices to drum up demand.

Despite input costs rising sharply, the composite output prices index was firmly below breakeven at 49.2, albeit above September's 47.8.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.5 from 50.6 in the previous month.
The reading, published on Wednesday, came in higher than a flash estimate of 48.9 but still marked the first month since June that the services index was below the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction.
The biggest drops were reported by hotels and restaurants, which were hit by travel curbs and local curfews in October. Transportation and storage providers also registered weaker activity.
""As many businesses close their doors again during November and virus cases continue to rise, a double dip in economic activity is looking increasingly likely,"" IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said.
Germany entered a partial lockdown on Monday at least until the end of November, forcing bars, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theatres and domestic tourism to close. Shops can remain open under conditions to guarantee social distancing.
But the drop in services activity was offset, by robust growth in manufacturing in October and the final composite PMI, which covers both sectors of the economy, rose to 55.0 from 54.7 in September. That was higher than the flash figure of 54.5.
The German economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter as higher consumer spending and exports helped Europe's largest economy start to recover from its worst-ever recession, caused by the pandemic.

Economists expect the economy to stagnate or even shrink again in the fourth quarter, however, due to the new lockdown measures.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 47.5 from 48.5 in September, marginally better than a preliminary reading of 47.3.
The index dropped further away from the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction to hit its lowest level since May, when France emerged from a first lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
""The results point to a worrying trend for business activity, showing that the recent surge in infections and the introduction of new restrictions have already negatively impacted the economy,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""Moving through the winter months, the downward trajectory is likely to persist, particularly as declines at service providers begin to spill over onto their manufacturing counterparts,"" he added.
In October, a government curfew aimed at halting a resurgence of new COVID-19 cases met with little success, leading to a new nationwide lockdown last week.
In the face of the new restrictions, the PMI index for the dominant service sector fell to 46.5 from 47.5 in September, unchanged from a preliminary reading.

The weakness offset an improvement in the manufacturing sector, which remained in expansionary mode, according to already published data.

Investing.com – China’s services sector saw a sixth consecutive month of growth in October, with hiring seeing its highest level in a year but overseas demand dropping.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) grew to 56.8 in October, higher than the previous month’s 54.8 reading and above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. The Caixin manufacturing PMI for October, released earlier in the week, rose to 53.6. The manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, released on Saturday, rose to 51.4 and 56.2 respectively.
Accounting for around 60% of the world’s second largest economy and half of urban jobs, the services sector had trailed behind the manufacturing sector in recovering from the impact of the nationwide COVID-19 lockdowns imposed earlier in the year. Although domestic demand boosted the service sector recovery, which has quickened in the past months, new export business received by Chinese services firms slipped further into contraction in October, the fastest rate since July.
European countries, such as France, Germany and the U.K. have recently re-imposed lockdowns to curb a second wave of COVID-19 cases in Europe and the U.S.
""The second wave of COVID-19 infections in Europe and the third wave in the U.S. have significantly suppressed China's overseas demand,"" Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in comments released alongside the survey.
However, hiring by Chinese firms rose for the third consecutive month and at the fastest pace since September 2019, hinting at the labor market’s continuing recovery from the COVID-19 impact.
Although the sector’s rebound was boosted by recovering pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion and buoyant exports, there were warnings of a dimming global outlook as the fight against COVID-19 continues.
""In the coming months, a continued recovery of the Chinese economy is highly likely, but it is necessary to be cautious about the normalization of monetary and fiscal policies in the post-epidemic period,"" Wang added.
China reported a weaker-than-expected GDP of 4.9% in the third quarter year-on-year in October, and GDP for the full year is projected to grow around 2%, the weakest in three decades."

Quarterly retail volumes advanced 6.5% in the three months through September, after declining 3.5% in the prior quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. Growth was partly offset by a 4.2% decline in Victoria state, which remained under lockdown in the quarter, while sales in New South Wales soared 11.6%, leading gains in all states and territories.
“The quarterly rise was driven by a recovery in industries that saw sharp falls in the June quarter 2020, as well as continued strength in industries such as food retailing, other retailing and household goods,” said Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys at the ABS.
Australia’s economy is showing signs of strengthening as consumer confidence surges, with optimists now exceeding pessimists, job advertisements advancing and house prices rising for the first time in six months. The recovery will receive a boost from the Reserve Bank of Australia‘s new round of stimulus.
The RBA on Tuesday cut its key interest rate, its three-year bond yield target and a bank lending facility rate, all to 0.10% from 0.25%. It also announced a A$100 billion ($71.5 billion) quantitative easing program to spur hiring and investment. At the same time, the central bank said it was upgrading its near-term economic outlook.
“The recent household spending and employment data have been a little stronger than we were expecting,” RBA chief Philip Lowe said in a speech Tuesday.
“It now appears probable that GDP increased solidly in the September quarter despite the lockdown in Victoria,” he said. “And growth over the year to June 2021 is expected to be close to 6%, compared with an expectation of 4% growth when we reviewed our forecasts three months ago.”
Wednesday’s quarterly sales release removes the impact of prices and provides a gauge of the household consumption component of gross domestic product, which accounts for more than half of activity.
The seeming contradiction in delivering more stimulus despite the better economic outlook is explained by expectations that unemployment will remain elevated for an extended period. A separate ABS report Wednesday showed payrolls fell 0.8% in the two weeks to Oct. 17.
On a monthly basis, retail sales slid 1.1% in September, compared with economists’ forecasts for a 1.5% drop.

1259,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>","China's service sector recovery strengthens in October, hiring picks up: Caixin PMI","BEIJING (Reuters) - The recovery in China's service sector activity extended into a sixth straight month in October, an industry survey showed on Wednesday, with hiring picking up to the highest level in a year but overseas demand slipping. 
The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.8 from September's 54.8, the highest reading since June and staying well above the 50-mark that separates monthly growth from contraction.
The services sector, which accounts for about 60% of the economy and half of urban jobs, had initially been slower to return to growth than large manufacturers, but the recovery has gathered pace in recent months.
Domestic demand drove activity, with the survey showing new export business received by Chinese services firms slipping further into contraction in October, at the fastest rate since July.
""The second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe and the third wave in the U.S. have significantly suppressed China's overseas demand,"" said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, in comments released alongside the survey.
But firms hired more for the third month in a row and at the fastest pace since September 2019, indicating a strengthening recovery in a labour market hit hard earlier in the year by measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus. 
Service firms were highly optimistic about business prospects, with a sub-index for confidence in the year rising to the strongest level since 2012. 
The official PMI showed activity in China's services sector expanded at the fastest pace since 2013 in October.
Pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion and surprisingly resilient exports have propelled China's rebound, though the global outlook is dimming as many Western countries battle renewed surges in the virus that causes COVID-19, with some going back into virus lockdowns.
""In the coming months, a continued recovery of the Chinese economy is highly likely, but it is necessary to be cautious about the normalisation of monetary and fiscal policies in the post-epidemic period,"" Wang said. 

China's economy grew a weaker-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter from a year earlier. It is expected to expand around 2% for the full year - the weakest in more than three decades but still much stronger than other major economies.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",U.S. factory orders rise solidly; outlook uncertain,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made goods increased solidly in September, but further gains could be limited amid an anticipated slowdown in consumer spending as government money for businesses and workers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic runs out. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that factory orders rose 1.1% after climbing 0.6% in August. Orders were boosted by increased demand for primary metals, computers and electronic products as well as motor vehicles and fabricated metal products. But orders for machinery, furniture and electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would rise 1.0% in September.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of U.S. economic activity, has been boosted by a shift in spending from services toward goods as Americans set up home offices and remote classrooms and avoid public transportation because of the coronavirus. 
A survey on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management on Monday showed its measure of national factory activity raced to its highest level in nearly two years in October, with new orders surging to their highest level in almost 17 years. 
But the strong manufacturing sentiment likely overstates the health of the sector. A report from the Federal Reserve last month showed production at factories dropped 0.3% in September and remained 6.4% below its pre-pandemic level.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors bet Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would beat President Donald Trump in Tuesday's bitterly contested election. The dollar (DXY) fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief juiced economic growth last quarter, with nearly all segments rebounding strongly, with the exception of government spending and business investment in intellectual property products and nonresidential structures like gas and oil well drilling.
The economy grew at a historic 33.1% annualized rate in the July-September period. That followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the second quarter. Output remains 3.5% below its level at the end of 2019. There is no deal in sight for another round of fiscal stimulus. 
Unfilled orders at factories fell 0.2% in September after declining 0.6% in August. Inventories at factories were unchanged for a second straight month, while shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.3%.
The government also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, increased 1.0% in September, as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, rose 0.5%. They were previously reported to have gained 0.3%.

Business spending on equipment rebounded at a 70.1% rate in the third quarter, ending five straight quarters of decline.

1261,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 02, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturing near two-year high; road ahead difficult,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated more than expected in October, with new orders jumping to their highest level in nearly 17 years amid a shift in spending toward goods like motor vehicles and food as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
The survey on Monday from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) was the last piece of major economic data before Tuesday's bitterly contested presidential election. But the outlook for manufacturing is challenging.
While the coronavirus crisis has boosted demand for goods complementing the pandemic life, a resurgence in new cases across the country could lead to authorities re-imposing restrictions to slow the spread of the respiratory illness as winter approaches, which could crimp activity. Government money for businesses and workers hit by the pandemic, which boosted economic growth in the third quarter, has dried up. 
""Manufacturing rebounded strongly with fewer restrictions on economic activity and stimulus efforts, but the path forward will be more difficult as the economy continues to cope with the pandemic,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. 
The ISM said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 59.3 last month. That was the highest since November 2018 and followed a reading of 55.4 in September. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 55.8 in October.
The jump in activity, however, likely overstates the health of the manufacturing sector. A report from the Federal Reserve last month showed output at factories dropping 0.3% in September and remaining 6.4% below its pre-pandemic level.
Manufacturers and suppliers said last month they ""continue to operate in reconfigured factories"" and with every month were ""becoming more proficient at expanding output."" 
Though sentiment among manufacturers remained upbeat, there were two positive comments for every cautious comment, a slight decrease compared to September. 
The outcome of Tuesday's vote is expected to lead to a brief period of uncertainty. President Donald Trump is trailing former Vice President and Democratic Party candidate, Joe Biden, in national opinion polls.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher following their steepest weekly loss. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

NEW ORDERS SURGE 
Fifteen industries, including apparel, food, furniture and transportation equipment reported growth last month. Textile mills and printing reported a contraction. 
Manufacturing's continued recovery will likely keep the economy floating, with growth expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter after a historic 33.1% annualized rate of expansion in the July-September period. 
Growth last quarter, which followed a record 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter, was juiced up by more than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief. There is no deal in sight for another round of fiscal stimulus.
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Monday showed construction spending rose a moderate 0.3% in September, slowing after a 0.8% increase in August. [
(GRAPHIC: Construction spending - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/nmovayaklva/constspend.png) 
The coronavirus crisis has pulled spending away from services towards goods that complement the changed life-style. Spending on goods has surpassed its pre-pandemic level.
Makers of chemical products reported ""business continues to be robust."" Food manufacturers said they had ""increased production due to stores stocking up for the second wave of COVID-19."" Manufacturers of computer and electronic products said the coronavirus continued ""to have an effect on supplier support and operations, more from a decreased labor perspective rather than unavailable material.""
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index surged to a reading of 67.9 last month, the highest reading since January 2004, from 60.2 in September. Customers' inventories remained too low for the 49th straight month and order backlogs steadily increased, which bodes well for future production.
""On the upside, social distancing efforts, which have been a factor in consumers pivoting spending away from services and toward goods, is showing no signs of abating, especially as virus case counts are surging again,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
""This shift to goods spending should continue to underpin orders, but is unlikely to go on with the same muster as it did earlier when an initial flurry of spending on manufactured goods aimed at setting up at-home offices and remote classrooms boosted goods spending.""
With orders booming, manufacturing employment expanded for the first time since July 2019. The ISM's manufacturing employment gauge rose to a reading of 53.2 from 49.6 in September. That likely supported overall job growth in October.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 700,000 jobs last month after rising 661,000 in September. Employment growth has cooled from a record 4.781 million in June. About 11.5 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered. 
The government is scheduled to publish October's employment report on Friday.

IHS Markit's Final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 58.2 in October, the highest reading since February 2018.
This was higher than a flash reading of 58.0 and surpassed September's 56.4 mark.
Phil Smith, principle economist at IHS Markit, said the recovery was being clouded by rising COVID-19 cases in Europe.
""Less positively and perhaps a sign that growth could be about to slow as more firms get back to pre-COVID levels of output, we saw the first setback to manufacturing expectations for seven months in October,"" said Smith.
""It comes amid rising numbers of coronavirus cases in Europe, and the increased threat of renewed disruption to supply and demand that comes with it,"" he added.
Chancellor Angela Merkel last week announced an emergency month-long lockdown that includes the closure of restaurants, gyms and theatres to reverse a spike in coronavirus cases that risks overwhelming hospitals.

The measure went into effect on Monday and include limiting private gatherings to 10 people from a maximum of two households. Restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas, pools and gyms will be shut and concerts cancelled. Schools and daycare centres remain open as well as shops under strict conditions.

Investing.com – China continued to see factory activity growth on its path towards economic recovery from COVID-19, but the pace of the growth slowed slightly in October.
The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for October rose to 53.6, beating the predicted 53 in forecasts prepared by Investing.com and September’s reading of 53, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released earlier in the day.
The data follows the growth reported in Saturday’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs, which rose to 51.4 and 56.2 respectively. Although the manufacturing PMI was slightly down from September’s reading of 51.5, it beat the forecast 51.3 figure. The composite PMI also grew 55.3%, more than the forecast 55.1%.
The positive data, particularly for new export orders (which rose to 51.0, improving from September’s 50.8), is a good indication that the trade figures will also be strong, China Everbright (OTC:CHFFF) Bank analyst Zhou Maohua said in a note. However, the spread of COVID-19 outside China could increase uncertainties for Chinese exports over the next few months, he added.
With Europe and the U.S. battling a second wave of COVID-19 cases, and the U.K. becoming the latest country to re-introduce lockdowns after France and Germany, the dim global outlook could well impact China’s own economic recovery.
Although pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion, and a surprising resilience in exports continue to drive the country’s economic recovery after a COVID-19-induced lockdown earlier in the year, the data showed that smaller firms slipped back into contraction at 49.4 from September’s 50.1 and unemployment continues to hamper the recovery. Employment fell to 49.3 in October from September’s 49.6.
However, some investors remained positive.
“The manufacturing industry overall continues to pick up,” said NBS official Zhao Qinghe, while also noting that small companies face weak market demand.
Some companies reported that the resurgence of the epidemic overseas had lengthened procurement periods for imports of raw materials and increased transport costs, he added in a NBS statement released with the data.
China also continues to deal with re-emerging clusters of the COVID1-19 virus in the country, but the number of cases remain low and daily life in the country is returning to normal.
Investors now await the Caixin services PMI and trade data, including imports and exports, due later in the week."

The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 53.6 from September's 53.0, with the gauge staying above the 50-level that separates growth from contraction for the sixth consecutive month.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast the headline reading would remain steady at 53.0.
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy early this year, though the global outlook is dimming as many Western countries battle still rising COVID-19 infections and go back into virus lockdowns.
October's PMI reading was the highest since January 2011. 
Pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure and surprisingly resilient exports have propelled the manufacturing rebound. Consumption, although hit hard earlier in the year, has also recovered in the third quarter.
""Recovery was the word in the current macro economy, with the domestic epidemic under control. Manufacturing supply and demand improved at the same time,"" Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, wrote in a note accompanying the survey release.
While the Caixin survey showed total new orders surged to the highest level since 2010, the gauge for new export orders fell from the month before, though it remained in expansionary territory. 
""The second wave of coronavirus infections in Europe and the third wave in the U.S. have significantly suppressed China’s overseas demand,"" Wang said.
The private survey also showed Chinese factories hired workers for the second month in a row, though the increase was slight.
Factory output also rose slightly from the month before, while a gauge of business confidence rose to a multi-year high.
The pandemic has been largely controlled in the world'ssecond-largest economy, although a local outbreak emerged recently in the western region of Xinjiang.
The Caixin survey focuses more on small and export-oriented firms while China's official survey, which was released on Saturday, largely tracks large companies and state-owned enterprises.
The official gauge showed factory activity expanded at a slightly slower pace in October but it was slightly above analysts' expectations.
""There are still many uncertainties outside of China, so policymakers need to be cautious about normalizing post-coronavirus monetary and fiscal policies,"" said Wang.

Analysts expect China's economy to grow about 2% in 2020, the weakest since 1976 but still far stronger than other major economies.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean exports slipped back into contraction in October, as the Chuseok holiday cut working days, although chip and car sales remained robust, government data showed on Sunday.
Exports slid 3.6% from a year earlier to $44.98 billion, after a 7.6% jump in September - the first expansion since February and the fastest rise in 23 months.
The October decline was less than the 4.0% drop forecast by 15 economists in a Reuters survey.
Average daily exports, however, recorded the first expansion in nine months with a 5.6% rise, adding to recent signs that Asia's fourth-largest economy is seeing a moderate recovery.
South Korea's monthly trade data, the first to be released among major exporting economies, is considered a bellwether for global trade.
A ""negative reading was inevitable due to fewer working days, but the rate of decline was better than expected. ... That shows exports recovery has been resilient at least by October,"" said HI Investment & Securities' chief economist Park Sang-hyun.
The trade ministry said shipments of semiconductors and cars jumped 10.4% and 5.8%, respectively, but those surged 20.9% and 15.9% each in average daily terms.
Shipments to China, South Korea's biggest trading partner, dropped 5.7% due to its eight-day National Day holiday, but that rose 3.2% when eliminating calendar effect, the trade ministry said.
Those to the United States and European Union rose 3.3% and 9.5%, but surged 13.1% and 19.9%, respectively, in per-day terms.
Economists are now worried surging coronavirus cases globally and fresh lockdowns in Europe may hurt overseas demand for South Korean goods again.
Given the time lag in export orders, ""shipments to the EU in December-January is the biggest worrisome,"" Park said. ""But exports to China will likely rebound and may offset the sluggish sales to EU.""
October imports fell 5.8%, reversing the previous month's 1.6% rise. This led to a preliminary trade surplus of $5.98 billion, smaller than $8.70 billion in September.

Analysts had expected a 2.1% drop in imports.

But smaller firms continued to struggle. A sub-index for those companies stood at 49.4 in October, slipping back into contraction from September's 50.1.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy grew 12.0% during the third quarter, largely as expected, making up for much of the record contraction over the previous three months at the height of the coronavirus lockdown, preliminary data showed on Friday.
The seasonally-adjusted jump in gross domestic product (GDP) published by national statistics agency INEGI was fractionally better than the 11.9% expansion predicted by a Reuters poll.
The quarter-on-quarter increase was easily the biggest since current records began at the start of the 1980s, and benefited from massive stimulus spending in the United States.
U.S. demand helped Mexico rack up large trade surpluses during the past four months, as exports picked up speed, especially in the automotive industry. By contrast, domestic demand has lagged, with many businesses still struggling.
Alfredo Coutino, an economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, said Mexico was still heavily reliant on the U.S. economy, and forecast the recovery would slow in the months ahead.
""The Mexican economy is benefiting from the upturn in the U.S. business cycle, mainly through the U.S. demand for Mexican exports and remittances sent by Mexican migrants working in the U.S.,"" Coutino said in a research note.
Between April and June, at the peak of Mexico's pandemic lockdown, the economy shrank 17.1% from the first quarter.
Mexico has not recovered as quickly as the U.S. economy, which shrank by an annualized rate of 31.4% in the second quarter then jumped by 33.1% in the July-September period.
COMEBACK
Despite the economic chaos of the pandemic, remittances to Mexico have surged this year, and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has forecast they will reach a record $40 billion.
During a regular news conference, Lopez Obrador hailed the GDP figures as evidence the economy was bouncing back.
A breakdown of the data showed primary activities like farming, forestry and fishing advanced by 7.4% compared with the previous quarter. Secondary activities such as manufacturing increased by 22.0%, INEGI said. Meanwhile tertiary activities, which encompass consumer spending and services, climbed 8.6%.
Lopez Obrador was eager to point out that the primary sector, which he has pushed with schemes to boost farming and tree planting, is doing better now than it was a year ago.
Mexico's economy is forecast to shrink almost 10% in 2020, its deepest annual contraction since the Great Depression.
However, primary activities, which make up only a small part of the economy, were up 2.7% in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period in 2019, INEGI said.
The severest months for the Mexican economy were April and May, when much of business activity ground to a halt, leading to the loss of roughly one million formal jobs. By Oct. 28, more than 400,000 jobs had been recovered, Lopez Obrador said.
Compared with the same period last year, Latin America's no. 2 economy shrank by 8.6% in unadjusted terms in the third quarter, just less than the Reuters forecast of 8.7%.

Final third quarter data is due to be published on Nov. 26.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending beats forecasts; worries over decreasing government money,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in September, but decreasing benefits for millions of unemployed Americans, cooling temperatures and a resurgence in COVID-19 cases across the nation could crimp spending in the fourth quarter.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed inflation remaining muted last month, which could allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates near zero for a while to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 recession as fiscal stimulus runs out. More than $3 trillion in government pandemic relief, which included a weekly unemployment benefits subsidy, spurred record economic growth in the third quarter.
""This recovery could be at risk without additional stimulus, as households with unemployed workers find themselves stretched financially heading into the holiday shopping season,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Personal income and consumer spending could also take a big hit if the pandemic continues to spread and states re-impose restrictions on economic activity in response.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 1.4% last month after gaining 1% in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending rising 1% in September.
Consumers boosted purchases of goods like new motor vehicles, clothing and footwear. They also lifted spending on healthcare, membership clubs, as well as outlays at sports centers, parks, theaters and museums. Still, consumer spending remains below its level at the start of the year, held back by outlays on services like air travel and hotel accommodation.
Spending has shifted towards goods, indicating the services-driven economy's recovery from the recession, which started in February, would be slower than previous downturns. 
Consumer sentiment was little changed at the end of October from earlier in the month amid fears over rising COVID-19 cases, other data showed on Friday.
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar dipped versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
DROPPED THE BALL
The spending data was included in Thursday's advance gross domestic product report for the third quarter, which showed the economy rebounding at a historic 33.1% annualized rate. That followed a 31.4% pace of contraction the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
A jaw-dropping 40.7% pace of growth in consumer spending accounted for 76.3% to the bounce back in GDP. The economy remains 3.5% below its level at the end of 2019 and analysts expect the gap to be closed in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Much of the spending last quarter was driven by billions of dollars in government transfers, including a $600 weekly unemployment subsidy and a one-off $1,200 check to households.
Unemployment insurance payments tumbled 42.2% to $364.8 billion last month. The government attributed the plunge to the expiration of the $600 weekly unemployment supplement in July. The decrease was partially offset by a 34.6% increase in other government transfers, including an additional weekly $300 unemployment benefit, which replaced the $600 subsidy. 
Funding for the $300 weekly subsidy mostly ran out in September and there is no deal in sight for another rescue package. The smaller supplement, together with gains in wages and rental income boosted personal income, which rebounded 0.9% in September after falling 2.5% in August. 
""There is clear evidence some people are being left behind,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Congress has dropped the ball and income will fall bigly in the next income and consumption report. Couple that with a COVID resurgence and the fourth quarter will be challenging.""
Americans are also dipping into savings to fund spending. The saving rate slipped to a still high 14.3% from 14.8% in August. It peaked at record 33.6% in April.
Despite the stronger-than-expected jump in consumer spending last month, inflation remained benign. 
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2% after climbing 0.3% in August. In the 12 months through September, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5% after advancing 1.4% in August.
The core PCE index is the preferred inflation measure for the Fed's 2% target, a flexible average. 
The tame inflation environment was underscored by a third report from the Labor Department on Friday showing the Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.5% in the third quarter, matching the second quarter's gain. 
That lowered the year-on-year rate of increase to 2.4%, the smallest rise since the second quarter of 2017, from 2.7% in the April-June period. The ECI is widely viewed by policymakers and economists as one of the better measures of labor market slack and a predictor of core inflation as it adjusts for composition and job quality changes.

""The easing trend in compensation costs suggest that inflation should not rise to a threatening pace anytime soon,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

But consumer prices continued to fall in October as expected, Eurostat estimated, pulled down by plunging energy costs despite more expensive food alcohol and tobacco.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy grew by a record 8.2% in the third quarter as higher consumer spending and exports helped Europe's largest economy to recover partly from its worst-ever recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, data showed on Friday.
The jump in output from July to September was the biggest since the Federal Statistic Office began collecting quarterly growth data in 1970 and was stronger than the 7.3% increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.
The jump followed an unprecedented plunge of nearly 10% in the second quarter, when household spending, company investments and trade collapsed during the first wave of the pandemic.
""The deeper you push a ball under water, the higher it jumps out of it. That also applies to the economy,"" DekaBank analyst Andreas Scheuerle said.
An aggressive second wave of infections and a new partial lockdown to slow down the spread of the disease are now clouding the growth outlook for the fourth quarter and beyond.
The bigger-than-expected rebound in the third quarter was driven by higher private consumption, rebounding investments in equipment and strong exports, the statistics office said.
The preliminary data did not include a lot of details, but car companies and engineering associations have pointed to surprisingly strong demand from China in recent months.
Separately, the German government on Friday revised upwards its estimate for gross domestic product this year. It now expects GDP to shrink by 5.5% in 2020 compared with a previous estimate for a 5.8% decline. Adjusted for calendar effects, it sees the economy shrinking by 5.9%.
The government confirmed its 2021 forecast for the economy to grow by 4.4% despite the second wave of infections and the partial lockdown. Bars, restaurants, cinemas and gyms will close from Monday until end of November. Schools and shops will stay open under certain conditions.
The government is planning to compensate companies affected by the lockdown by paying them up to 75% of their sales from last year's November. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has earmarked 10 billion euros for this new aid package.
The government has since March unleashed massive rescue and stimulus measures, including cash handouts for parents and a temporary value-added tax cut that together seem to have stabilized domestic demand.
But in a sign that some consumers are holding back despite relatively stable employment and income, retail sales fell more than expected on the month in September, separate data showed.

Compared with February, the month before the coronavirus outbreak in Germany, retail sales in September were 2.8% higher.

But on a quarterly, seasonally adjusted basis, the economy grew by 3%, compared with a 0.1% contraction in the previous three months, advance estimates showed.
It is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year contractions for the city, which was hit hard by anti-government protests last year and more recently by the global health crisis and geopolitical tension.

Values climbed 5.8% from a year earlier to an average of 227,825 pounds ($294,000), Nationwide Building Society said Friday. The report comes a day after Bank of England data showed mortgage approvals reached a 13-year high.
In October alone, prices gained 0.8% as a government tax cut fed post-lockdown demand to move. It left values up 3.5% over the past three months, the biggest gain since 2009.
Still, that jump stands in contrast with reports from other parts of the economy, which are already losing steam in their recovery from the initial wave of coronavirus disruption.
With new restrictions to control a resurgence in the virus becoming more severe, Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank said on Friday its measure of U.K. business confidence fell for the first time since May.
The stand-out strength in the housing market is in large part due to a government decision to suspend a tax on home purchases until the end of March. There’s also evidence of pent-up demand following the lockdown, as well as a desire for bigger properties as people work from home more regularly.
Many analysts say gains will reverse next year as unemployment rises and aid packages come to an end. That could be compounded by more severe restrictions to control the spread of the virus.
“The outlook remains highly uncertain and will depend heavily on how the pandemic and the measures to contain it evolve,” said Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. “Activity is likely to slow in the coming quarters, perhaps sharply.”"

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's industrial output rose for the fourth straight month in September as the world's third-largest economy continued to shake off the drag from the COVID-19 crisis largely thanks to improving external demand.
Separate data showed the September jobless rate held steady, while the number of available jobs per applicant fell to the lowest level since late 2013.
Official data released on Friday showed factory output surged 4.0% in September from the previous month, mainly due to strength in car and production machinery manufacturing.
""Overseas economies and especially China are picking up, and Japan's exports are growing,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG)  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities.
""The output recovery in the automobile industry and in high-tech components whose production moves closely in line with exports is the overall driving force.""
The jump beat the median market forecast of a 3.2% gain in a Reuters poll of economists, and compared with a downwardly revised 1.0% rise in August.
Manufacturers surveyed by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) expect output to rise 4.5% in October and 1.2% in November.
The government kept unchanged its assessment of industrial production, saying it was picking up.
The economy posted its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic but has been gradually recovering. Gross domestic product data due on Nov. 16 is expected to show a return to growth in the three months through September, thanks in part to a rebound in exports and output.
But some analysts warned that capital spending will likely put a drag on third-quarter growth as firms are forced to put off investments due to the heavy impact of COVID-19 on corporate earnings.
""Capital spending usually recovers slower than output,"" said Miyazaki. ""It'll possibly pull down third-quarter growth.""
Output of capital goods, which are an indicator of the health of capital spending, rose just 2.6% from the previous month, following a steep 4.5% fall in August.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will announce next week a plan for extra stimulus measures to speed up the patchy recovery, four government and ruling party sources told Reuters this week.
Although the size of the package has yet to be decided, some ruling party lawmakers have already called for one of about 10 trillion yen ($95.51 billion), including measures to stimulate domestic demand.
Japan's seasonally adjusted jobless rate was steady at 3.0% in September, separate government data showed, beating the median estimate of 3.1%.

The jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 1.03 in September from 1.04 in the previous month to hit its lowest level since December 2013.

1276,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Economy Shows First Signs of Revival Since Protests Began,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s economy is showing the first signs of emerging from a crippling recession sparked by political unrest last year and deepened by the global pandemic.
After more than a year of weakness in multiple economic indicators, data this week showed exports from the Asian financial hub surged the most in almost two years in September, fueled by a 17% increase in shipments to mainland China. Advance third-quarter economic growth figures to be released today are forecast to show quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.7%, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
That would mark the first time the measure has risen since before the start of anti-government protests last year, as a third wave of virus infections subsided last month. The economy has been in its longest recession since the tumultuous period from 1997 to 1998 that included the handover to China and the Asia financial crisis.
Still, the recovery is nascent and Hong Kong will need more robust commerce and tourism to sustain a return to economic growth, economists say. On a year-on-year basis, the city’s economy is forecast to extend declines for a fifth quarter.
“Hong Kong needs to see its border reopening with mainland China before the city can benefit from the rapid recovery there,” said Tommy Wu, senior economist with Oxford Economics in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is among other economies in Asia including Singapore and South Korea that are starting to recover from months of anti-virus measures. Removing border restrictions with the mainland would benefit industries beyond tourism -- such as trade and finance -- making it the government’s most urgent task alongside containing the virus, said Dong Chen, senior Asia economist with Pictet Wealth Management.
“Opening the border needs to be a government priority,” Chen said.
Hong Kong and Singapore have announced plans to create a travel bubble between the two cities that is targeted to launch next month, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a press briefing. People in both cities would be exempted from compulsory quarantine, replaced by coronavirus testing. The pact joins efforts in several markets in the region to loosen travel restrictions.
In an Oct. 25 blog post Financial Secretary Paul Chan said if the flow of people and commerce between Hong Kong and mainland China is safely restored, the city can be “revitalized substantially” even if the global economy remains constrained.
‘Main Force’
“The sustained rapid economic recovery in the mainland can be said to be the main force supporting the Hong Kong economy,” Chan said. “Only by effectively controlling the epidemic and thoroughly cleaning up local infection cases can we truly create an environment conducive to economic recovery.”
The government is pursuing a law that would make Covid-19 tests mandatory for some groups even as it slowly eases virus-related restrictions, Lam said at the briefing. Hong Kong is ready to re-open the border with China from a technical perspective, but it requires mutual consent, she said.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s efforts to stimulate the economy remain under scrutiny. The city has announced more than HK$310 billion ($40 billion) in relief this year, yet the prolonged recession has led to shuttered storefronts and unemployment at an almost 16-year high of 6.4% as of September. Joblessness is likely to rise further after Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd. last week said it will slash more than 5,000 jobs and close a regional carrier.
Cathay Pacific Joins Aviation Jobs Cull, Closes Regional Carrier
Hong Kong, along with the rest of the world, must reckon with the human cost of the pandemic, said Iris Pang, greater China chief economist with ING Bank NV.
“Certainly the economy will benefit from opening the border,” she said. “But the loss of human lives, in terms of economic theory, hurts the long-term growth of an economy.”

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 29, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. economy posts record growth in third quarter; COVID-19 scarring to last,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a historic pace in the third quarter as the government injected more than $3 trillion worth of pandemic relief which fueled consumer spending, but the deep scars from the COVID-19 recession could take a year or more to heal.
The 33.1% annualized growth rate reported by the Commerce Department on Thursday, the last major economic scorecard before next Tuesday's presidential election, did not ease the human tragedy inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic, with tens of millions of Americans still unemployed and more than 222,000 dead.
The economy remains 3.5% below its level at the end of 2019 and incomes plunged in the third quarter. Nevertheless, with five days remaining to Election Day President Donald Trump, trailing in most national opinion polls, cheered the report.
""Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""So glad this great GDP number came out before November 3rd.""
Trump's Democratic challenger Joe Biden highlighted the lack of full recovery and the rapidly petering growth spurt.
""We are in a deep hole and President Trump's failure to act has meant that third-quarter growth wasn't nearly enough to get us out of (it),"" said Biden. ""The recovery that is happening is helping those at the top, but leaving tens of millions of working families and small businesses behind.""
According to Christopher Way, an associate professor of government at Cornell University, the report ""will have absolutely zero effect on the election and it is economic performance in the first half of an election year that matters.""
The rebound in gross domestic product followed a 31.4% rate of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest since the government started keeping records in 1947. On a year-on-year basis GDP jumped 7.4% last quarter after sinking 9.0% in the April-June period. The rebound reversed about two-thirds of the 10.1% drop in GDP in the first half. By comparison, the economy contracted 4% peak to trough during the 2007-09 Great Recession. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP expanding at a 31% rate in the July-September quarter. The economy plunged into recession in February.
The government's rescue package provided a lifeline for many businesses and the unemployed, juicing up consumer spending, which on its own contributed 76.3% to the surge in GDP.
But government funding has been depleted with no deal in sight for another round of relief. New COVID-19 cases are spiraling across the country, forcing restrictions on businesses like restaurants and bars.
""We still don't have the level of GDP surpassing the pre-COVID level until fourth-quarter 2021 and closing the output gap will take even more time,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
Foreshadowing a slowdown in consumer spending, personal income tumbled at a $540.6 billion rate in the third quarter after surging at a $1.45 trillion pace in the prior period. The drop was attributed to a decline in government transfers related to the pandemic relief programs. 
Though savings remain high, the pace at which Americans are stashing away money is moderating. That, together with persistent layoffs and slowing employment growth could restrain consumer spending in the coming months. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
ELEVATED LAYOFFS
A separate report from the Labor Department on Thursday showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 40,000 to a seasonally adjusted 751,000 in the week ending Oct. 24. Including a government funded program, 1.1 million people sought unemployment benefits last week.
Though claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million in March, they remain above their 665,000 peak seen during the 2007-09 Great Recession. About 22.7 million Americans were receiving unemployment benefits in early October, though many have exhausted their eligibility for state aid. 
Just over half of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recouped.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, rebounded at a historic rate of 40.7% in the third quarter, driven by purchases of goods like motor vehicles, clothing and footwear. Americans also boosted spending on recreation, healthcare and dining out. But spending on services remained below its fourth quarter level. 
Spending was boosted by billions of dollars in government transfers, including a $600 weekly unemployment subsidy and a one-off $1,200 check to households. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are below a 5% rate.
""Without further stimulus, the winter may indeed be very painful,"" said Jeff Madrick, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York.
The shift toward goods spending pulled in imports, resulting in a widening of the trade deficit. Some of the imports, however, ended up in warehouses. The accumulation of inventory offset the trade hit to GDP growth.
There was also a turnaround in business investment after the second-quarter drubbing, but the bounce could be temporary as demand for goods that do not complement life-style changes brought by COVID-19 remains weak.  Boeing Co  (N:BA) reported its fourth straight quarterly loss on Wednesday.
The pandemic has also crushed oil prices, weighing on spending on nonresidential structures like gas and oil well drilling. Business spending on nonresidential structures contracted for a fourth straight quarter. 

Record low interest rates boosted housing. Government spending fell, pressured by cuts at state and local governments, whose finances have been squeezed by the coronavirus.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 2.2% to 130.0. The decreasing was likely due to a shortage of homes available for sale. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, rising 3.4% in September.
Pending home sales increased 20.5% from a year ago. 
The housing market has been one of the economy's star performers even as the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown millions out of work. The unemployment burden has fallen disproportionately on low-wage earners in the services industry, who tend to be young.
There has been a surge in demand for housing in suburbs and low-density areas as Americans seek spacious accommodation in the new work-from-home era. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is averaging 2.80%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). 
Reports this month showed a surge in homebuilder confidence in October, and an acceleration in single-family home construction and sales of previously owned homes in September.

Last month, pending home sales rose in the Northeast. They fell in the Midwest, South and West.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy grew at its fastest rate since records began in the third quarter, reversing much - but by no means all - of the output lost in the second quarter under the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Commerce Department said gross domestic product grew at an annualized 33.1% in the quarter, after contracting by 31% in the second quarter. Analysts had expected an expansion of 31.9%.
U.S. stock futures turned positive on the news, with the Dow 30 futures contract rising 110 points in response, erasing earlier losses for the session. The dollar also strengthened to $1.1706 against the euro, albeit the latter was hit by the European Central Bank signaling after its council meeting that it will likely ease monetary policy again in December.
The figures, while spectacular, are essentially backward-looking and exaggerated by the habit of annualizing GDP data.  They reflect the reopening of many businesses in the summer after government-mandated stay-at-home orders had crippled both manufacturing and services output in the spring.
""The general population judge living standards by their personal experience, not abstract concepts,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, in a morning podcast.
An arguably better indication of current developments in the economy came from the weekly jobless claims numbers, which were released at the same time.

The European Commission's monthly survey showed sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro unchanged at 90.9 points this month, beating market expectations of a drop to 89.5 points.
The survey is typically conducted in the first two to three weeks of the month, meaning they relate to the mood before this week's announcements of lockdowns in France and Germany.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German unemployment fell much more than expected in October and demand for job protection schemes kept declining as the labour market in Europe's largest economy continued to recover from the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
The surprisingly strong data, released by the Labour Office on Thursday, suggested household spending should support growth in the fourth quarter, though a partial lockdown to break a second wave of infections, which takes effect on Monday, is likely to hurt consumption.
The number of people out of work fell by 35,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.863 million, the data showed, far more than a 5,000 drop forecast in a Reuters poll.
The unemployment rate eased to 6.2% in October from 6.3% in the previous month.
""Unemployment and underemployment fell sharply in October. The use of short-time work continues to decline,"" Labour Office head Detlef Scheele said. But he added that there were still some scars from the first wave of the pandemic and that the new curbs would also weigh.
""This will hit the labour market, but it won't collapse,"" Scheele said.
The number of people on short-time work schemes, which have shielded the labour market from the brunt of the pandemic, dropped sharply to 2.58 million in August - the last month for which reliable data was available.
This compared to more than 4 million in July and a peak of nearly 6 million reached in April, at the height of the pandemic.
The government hopes that its massive rescue and stimulus measures supported a strong recovery over the summer months after the economy plunged by nearly 10% in the second quarter.
Preliminary third-quarter gross domestic product figures are due on Friday, with analysts predicting a rebound with the quarterly output jumping 7.3%.
For the fourth quarter, the Ifo institute on Monday forecast a slowdown in economic growth to 2.1%.
But that was before federal and state governments late on Wednesday announced a partial lockdown that will force restaurants, bars, cinemas, theatres and gyms to close from Nov. 2 until the end of the month. Shops can remain open under strict conditions, and schools and day care centres are to stay open.

LONDON (Reuters) - British lenders approved the highest number of mortgages since September 2007 last month, unexpectedly extending a post-lockdown surge, but there was a record drop in unsecured lending to consumers, Bank of England data showed on Thursday.
Mortgage approvals for house purchase jumped to 91,454 in September from August's already-high reading of 85,530, exceeding all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had instead pointed to a decline.
Activity in Britain's housing market has rebounded sharply since the end of lockdown restrictions and was further fuelled when finance minister Rishi Sunak temporarily suspended property purchase taxes in July.
Earlier this month, mortgage lender Halifax reported a 7.3% annual rise in house prices for September, the biggest increase since 2016.
The rapid rebound in the property market contrasts with a gloomier picture for many other parts of Britain's economy, which shrank by 20% in the three months to June. Output in August was still 9% lower than before the pandemic.
The housing market pick-up is likely to fade, Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco, said.
""The post-lockdown bull run is already over,"" he said. ""Lenders have been pulling down the shutters due to ongoing struggles with capacity and concerns over rising unemployment levels, specifically the impact on house price growth.""
Headwinds to the British economy are mounting with a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases through September and October, and the risk of higher unemployment as government job support is steadily scaled back.
Unsecured lending to consumers in September was 4.6% lower than a year earlier, the sharpest annual drop since 1994 when the BoE started collecting these figures on a monthly basis.

BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Asia is starting to see signs of economic recovery as it rides on the back of an upturn in China, which is entering a new expansion phase less than a year after it recorded the world's first cases of COVID-19.
While international attention has been focused on the looming U.S. election and the struggle to halt the spread of the coronavirus in the Americas and Europe, China has quietly been clocking up improvements in several key sectors.
After imposing some of the world's strictest lockdown measures early in the pandemic, China is now the only major economy forecast by the International Monetary Fund to report growth - of 1.9% - this year. 
Official data showed China's economy grew 4.9% in the September quarter from a year earlier, following 3.2% growth in the second quarter and a 6.8% contraction at the start of the year when the domestic coronavirus outbreak was at its peak and lockdowns were imposed.
(Graphic: China's V-shaped recovery? link: https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-ECONOMY/GDP/qzjpqaewypx/chart.png)
""The underlying details ... make clear that the new expansion phase China is entering will prove strong and resilient,"" Westpac senior economist Elliot Clarke said. 
""As the world contracts by 4% in 2020, China is set to grow around 2%. And come 2021, a key support for world growth of around 6% will be near-10% growth in China."" 
For China's neighbours, that growth is increasing demand for their exports and supporting activity in their own economies. 
""China remains the only major commodity consumer where industrial production is now higher than pre-COVID levels,"" Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) analysts said. 
China's imports surged 13.2% year-on-year in September, with a 28% rise in semiconductor imports a boon for Taiwan and South Korea in particular. 
The flow-on for Seoul is already evident. Data on Tuesday showed South Korea posted its fastest quarterly growth rate in a decade in the September quarter, expanding a seasonally adjusted 1.9% after a 3.2% contraction the previous quarter. Exports soared 15.6% in the third quarter, the biggest rise since 1986 and largely reversing a 16.1% contraction in the second quarter. 
""Exports rapidly improved on the back of recovery in China and other major economies, which spearheaded our third quarter growth,"" Finance minister Hong Nam-ki said on Tuesday. 
China's early recovery has also been a relief for Japan, as China is the destination for more than 22% of its overall exports, just ahead of the 19% share that heads to the United States. 
Japan's exports to China jumped 14% in the year to September, the biggest rise in more than two years, driven by robust demand for nonferrous metals, chip-making equipment and automobiles. 
That is giving the Bank of Japan some optimism over the domestic outlook, with industry feedback pointing to improving demand from China. 
""Automobile sales in China are increasing from year before levels after economic activity resumed. We're seeing an increase in auto-parts exports to China,"" a transport machinery maker in Nagoya was quoted as saying in the BOJ's quarterly report on the regional economies.
Taiwan is also benefiting, even as political tensions with Beijing remain high. Its exports to China rose an annual 22% in September, and export orders, a key leading gauge for global tech demand, rose 9.9% as Chinese orders jumped by almost one-third. 
RISKS REMAIN
China's renewed growth has been spread across several sectors, including manufacturing, construction, investment and domestic demand.
There are risks to the outlook, however, including the potential that some economies shut down again to tame the coronavirus, a scenario mining giant  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO) flagged in a production report.
While Rio noted strong global activity in the third quarter, it also cautioned that a range of data suggested ""the rate of recovery in growth is slowing in most economies, with pent-up demand dissipating, and the rise of renewed lockdowns threatening recovery"".

Further, any escalation of China-U.S trade hostilities or other geopolitical tensions after the U.S. presidential election would also be a risk for Asia's hopes of sustained economic recovery.

1284,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>","Record U.S. third-quarter growth assured as goods trade deficit falls, inventories rise","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States' trade deficit in goods narrowed sharply in September and inventories at retailers surged, sealing expectations for record economic growth in the third quarter after the worst performance in at least 73 years.
The data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday added to reports ranging from retail sales, durable goods orders and housing that suggested the economy has regained some footing, though gross domestic product would still likely remain below the department's forecast for the fourth quarter. 
The anticipated surge in GDP was driven by a more than $3 trillion government rescue package early this year, which provided a lifeline for many businesses and the unemployed as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the economy. The fiscal stimulus has since been exhausted, leaving the outlook for the fourth quarter murky amid a resurgence in new coronavirus cases.
The government is scheduled to publish its advance GDP growth estimate for the third quarter on Thursday, five days ahead of the U.S. presidential election next Tuesday.
""We should remember output will be below that of the end of fourth quarter of 2019,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""There is a long way to go before the economy is fully healed and unfortunately the challenges are mounting.""
The goods trade deficit decreased 4.5% to $79.4 billion last month. Exports of goods increased 2.7% to $122 billion, led by a surge in shipments of foods, feeds and beverages. There were also increases in exports of motor vehicles, consumer and capital goods. Exports of industrial supplies fell.
Imports fell 0.2% to $201.4 billion last month, pulled down imports of industrial supplies, consumer goods and other goods.
U.S. stocks fell as spiraling coronavirus cases soured investor sentiment. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
SMALLER TRADE HIT 
September's decrease in the goods trade deficit after two straight monthly increases suggested trade would be a smaller drag on GDP growth than had been anticipated earlier. The trade hit to output could also be offset by accumulation of inventories.
Stocks at retailers jumped 1.6% last month after gaining 0.5% in August. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.9%.
The trade and retail inventory data put a upside risk to the third-quarter GDP growth estimate. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the economy likely grew at a 31% annualized rate in the July-September quarter. 
The anticipated historic growth pace would follow a 31.4% pace of contraction in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947.

""It will still likely take until the third quarter of 2021 for real GDP to regain its level of the fourth quarter of 2019,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Funds in New York.

1286,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 09:27PM ET</span>",China’s Recovery Shows Mixed Signals as Global Outlook Dims,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic recovery displayed mixed signals while remaining broadly steady in October, with small businesses turning more cautious and the property market weakening even as car sales soar.
The aggregate index combining eight early indicators tracked by Bloomberg was unchanged from the previous month.
Small business confidence eased in October, with sub-indices weakening across the board, according to Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which surveys more than 500 smaller firms each month. As the world’s largest exporter, China is exposed to the deteriorating outlook in the rest of the world amid resurgent virus cases, threatening a domestic recovery that remains otherwise robust.
“The pace of recovery slowed in October,” Standard Chartered’s economists Shen Lan and Ding Shuang, wrote in a report. “The ‘expectations’ sub-index fell to 52.6 in October from an average of 54.7 in the third quarter, indicating a more cautious business outlook toward year-end.”
Home sales, which remained fairly resilient despite the economic downturn this year, started to cool as policy makers tightened their grip on financing to developers.
South Korean exports, a barometer of global trade, also deteriorated in the first 20 days of October -- although the data was affected by fewer working days in the month. Factory deflation likely deepened in the month, weighing on profit growth at industrial firms that face a faster rise in input prices than output prices.
At the same time, car sales improved, registering solid growth in line with the general upward trend seen recently in consumer spending.
The pickup in consumption may help to spur services output, which outperformed manufacturing at smaller firms for the first time since the Covid-19 shock, according to Standard Chartered.
Purchasing managers’ indexes, due in coming days, will also give insight into the recovery. The official manufacturing index looks poised for a small retreat in October, likely because of closures during China’s golden week holiday this year, not a loss of recovery momentum, according to Bloomberg Economics’ Chang Shu.

1287,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>",Korea Consumer Confidence Jumps Most Since 2009 as Virus Eases,"(Bloomberg) -- South Korea’s consumer confidence jumped the most since the global financial crisis in another upbeat sign for the economy as it rebounds from a pandemic-driven recession.
The consumer sentiment index rose by 12.2 points in October to reach 91.6, the highest since February, the Bank of Korea said in a statement on Wednesday. The monthly increase was the biggest since April 2009.
The increased confidence coincides with stronger-than-expected economic growth last quarter led by exports and investment. The BOK said households’ perceptions of the economy and their finances improved as a summer coronavirus wave eased and the government relaxed social-distancing restrictions.
Biggest Export Jump Since 1986 Fuels Korea Recession Rebound
Among components of the headline index, households’ spending projections contributed the most to the rise, followed by expectations for income and the overall economic outlook. The reading below 100 means pessimism still outweighs optimism.
The sentiment index sank to 79.4 in September after daily infections snowballed to hundreds, prompting authorities to tighten business regulations. The resurgence has since waned, supporting optimism that the economy is set to emerge from the pandemic in better shape than most major economies where the virus is still spreading fast.
To accelerate the recovery momentum, South Korea‘s government is seeking to reinvigorate consumption with campaigns that include a nationwide shopping event in November. Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post Tuesday that the government will step up efforts to put the economy back on a normal track as soon as possible.
For the year as a whole, South Korea’s economy is still expected to shrink with a potential virus flareup at home and abroad a key risk. Its export-reliant rebound means unless the pandemic subsides in major trade partners, strong growth momentum is unlikely to be sustained.

The Conference Board's findings came ahead of next Tuesday's fiercely contested battle for the White House between Trump and Democratic nomineee Joe Biden. Trump is trailing the former vice president in national opinion polls.
Consumer confidence in Florida dropped to a reading of 100.3 this month from 114.4 in September. Though confidence has rebounded after slumping as the COVID-19 pandemic swept across the state, it is near levels seen just before the 2016 election.
In Pennsylvania, consumer confidence tumbled to a reading of 92.0 from 115.5 in September. Consumer confidence in Michigan fell to 119.2 in October from a reading of 124.1 in the prior month. Confidence in the three swing states was dragged by declines in consumers' expectations.
""The numbers can be choppy, but this does not bode well for Donald Trump's chances of re-election and with incomes being squeezed and COVID-19 cases on the rise, neither for the economy,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
Consumer confidence also fell in Ohio and Illinois and Texas this month, but edged up in New York and California. 
As result, overall consumer confidence dipped to a reading of 100.9 in October from 101.3 in September. 

""There is little to suggest that consumers foresee the economy gaining momentum in the final months of 2020, especially with COVID-19 cases on the rise and unemployment still high,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 27, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. core capital good orders hit six-year high; consumer confidence ebbs,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased to six-year high in September, wrapping up a quarter of potentially record growth in business spending and the economy, thanks to fiscal stimulus aimed at softening the blow from the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed shipments of these goods rising modestly last month, supporting expectations of slower economic activity heading into the fourth quarter. That was reinforced by a dip in consumer confidence this month. The reports came ahead of next Tuesday's fiercely contested presidential election. 
A more than $3 trillion government rescue package early this year provided a lifeline for many businesses and the unemployed, helping to boost consumer spending and the housing market. But funding has dried up and new coronavirus infections are surging across the country.
""The recovery is now entering a more challenging phase, in which it will face the pandemic crisis without meaningful fiscal support,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 1.0% last month to the highest level since September 2014. These so-called core capital goods orders rose 2.1% in August.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.5%. Though core capital goods orders have pulled above the their pre-pandemic level, they were down 0.5% year-on-year in September. 
Orders last month were lifted by increased demand for primary metals, fabricated metal products and computers and electronic products. But orders for machinery and electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
 Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT), a bellwether for economic activity, on Tuesday reported lower quarterly earnings, but said the pace of decline in sales of its yellow bulldozers, mining trucks and other equipment was moderating.
Separately, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to a reading of 100.9 this month from 101.3 in September amid concerns about the future. The Conference Board said ""there is little to suggest that consumers foresee the economy gaining momentum in the final months of 2020, especially with COVID-19 cases on the rise and unemployment still high."" 
Consumer confidence is now at levels seen in October 2016. There are fears that the outcome of next Tuesday's vote could weigh on business and consumer sentiment, and undercut the recovery from the worst recession in at least 73 years. 
More than four in ten supporters of both President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger and former Vice President, Joe Biden, said they would not accept the result of the November election if their preferred candidate loses, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
""Consumers are clearly worried about what tomorrow will bring as they have been hit with a second wave of the coronavirus, mounting election uncertainty as voting day grows close, and even the good news of the recovery in the stock market has gone away,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
U.S. stocks were trading lower. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
SHIPMENTS SLOWING
Shipments of core capital goods gained 0.3% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They increased 1.5% in August. 
The three straight months of growth in shipments likely helped to lift overall business investment from a deep hole in the third quarter. But September's small rise could be bad news for the fourth quarter.
Business investment tumbled at a record 27.2% annualized rate in the second quarter, with spending on equipment collapsing at an all-time pace of 35.9%. Investment in equipment has contracted for five straight quarters.
Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.2% annualized rate, which would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of the coronavirus.
The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. The government is scheduled to publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP on Thursday. 
Manufacturing is holding up. Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, jumped 1.9% in September after rising 0.4% in August. Durable goods orders were driven by a 4.1% rebound in orders for transportation equipment, which followed a 0.9% decline in August.
Orders for motor vehicles and parts recovered 1.5% after falling 4.1% in August. But there no orders for civilian aircraft reported for the third straight month.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co lost another three orders for its grounded 737 MAX jetliner in September, and delivered 11 total aircraft to customers, less than half the number from the same month a year ago, the planemaker reported this month. Boeing has struggled with cancellations as airlines grapple with sharply reduced demand for air travel because of the pandemic. 

The 737 MAX jets have been grounded since March 2019 following two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.

China's economic rebound has been gaining momentum following the sharp COVID-19-driven downturn thanks to strong exports, pent-up demand and government stimulus, but slower-than-expected third quarter gross domestic product growth highlighted pockets of weakness for one of the few drivers of global demand.
Profits at Chinese industrial firms in September rose 10.1% year-on-year to 646.43 billion yuan ($96.34 billion), National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Tuesday. 
That marked the fifth month of profit growth albeit slower than a 19.1% increase in August.
Zhu Hong, a senior statistician at the NBS, attributed the slower growth in September to deepening declines in factory-gate prices, rising losses from asset depreciation and increasing raw material costs for auto and electronics sectors.
Factory gate prices, a key barometer of industrial demand, fell at a faster-than-expected pace in September, and consumer inflation slowed to its weakest in 19 months.
""Although industrial profits continued to recover steadily in the first three quarters, cumulative operating income and profit growth have yet to turn positive, while growth rates of accounts receivable and inventory of finished goods are still high,"" Zhu said. 
""The foundation for continued improvements in corporate profits still needs to be consolidated."" 
For January-September, industrial firms' profits fell 2.4% on an annual basis to 4.37 trillion yuan, with the downturn easing from a 4.4% decrease in the first eight months.
Auto manufacturing, non-ferrous metal smelting and processing and ferrous metal smelting and processing industries contributed to the bulk of the profit increases in the first nine months. 
Major mining firms including  Zijin Mining  Group (SS:601899) and Chifeng  Jilong Gold  Mining (SS:600988) reported stronger net profits for the nine-month period.
Profit margins at big industrial firms rose 13.8% in the third quarter from a year ago, compared with a 4.0% fall in the second quarter, while earnings at small industrial firms rose 15.8% in the third quarter, NBS data showed. 

The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenue over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Surging shipments into the United States are fueling record high freight costs and logjams at seaports, but transportation executives say the rally will lose steam with a second wave of COVID-19 restrictions on the cards. 
Container shipping companies, which move goods for customers including Amazon.com (O:AMZN) and Walmart (N:WMT), got stung late last year and early this year when COVID-19 halted trade around the world, and they question whether the U.S. import boom can be sustained.
""Let's not get carried away,"" Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of Germany's Hapag Lloyd (DE:HLAG), told reporters. ""This is just a spike that no one has foreseen in an unusual period. There will be a correction to that.""
U.S. consumer confidence ticked up in September, when retail sales accelerated. Still, consumers are eating through savings, layoffs are mounting and the country just set a record for new COVID-19 infections.
""Everything depends on the demand and how the second wave of COVID affects the world economy,"" Aristides Pittas, CEO of shipping company Euroseas (O:ESEA), said at a Capital Link virtual event. 
In recent weeks, the cost of transporting goods from Asia to the United States - one of the world's biggest retail markets – topped $4,500 per 40-foot container unit (FEU), the highest recorded level, data from S&P Global Platts Containers showed. 
""We are sold out. The ships are 100% full. The containers are 100% full. You can't get a container,"" Jeremy Nixon, CEO of Japanese container group Ocean Network Express (ONE), said at a recent International Chamber of Shipping virtual event. 
Total imports to the 10 largest U.S. seaports increased 9.2% in August and 12.4% in September, trade data from Descartes (NASDAQ:DSGX) Systems (TO:DSG) showed. 
U.S. business inventories rebounded in August, as retailers and other companies raced to restock depleted warehouses and distribution centers. 
""Inventories are still quite low and there's a significant need to replenish them,"" said LeAnne Coulter, vice president of freight management at Penske Logistics. 
Data suggests that record volume at the Port of Los Angeles, the busiest U.S. ocean trade hub, could stretch through November. Meanwhile, it is causing backups that could ripple through the supply chain. 

""This will probably taper off in the first or second week of December,"" Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said of the import rush.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes unexpectedly fell in September after four straight monthly increases, but the housing market remains supported by record low mortgage rates and demand for more space as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
The decrease in sales reported by the Commerce Department on Monday followed data last week showing single-family homebuilding and permits racing to levels last seen in 2007 in September. Confidence among homebuilders hit a record high in October, while sales of previously owned homes jumped to their highest level in more than 14 years in September. 
""While there could be some ups and downs along the way, we still look for strength in the housing market as low mortgage rates boost activity and earlier pent-up demand for housing is released,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
New home sales fell 3.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 959,000 units last month. August's sales pace was revised down to 994,000 units from the previously reported 1.011 million units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 12.8% of housing market sales, rising 2.8% to a rate of 1.025 million units.
New home sales surged 32.1% year-on-year. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. September's monthly decline could, however, be flagging a slowdown in housing market momentum heading into the fourth quarter.
Applications for loans to purchase a home have dropped for four straight weeks. While homebuilder confidence is at historic highs, shortages of land, labor, lumber and other key building materials are lengthening construction times.
""This month's new home sales figures indicate that the housing market might be finally losing some steam,"" said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank in Jacksonville, Florida.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower, setting the Dow for its worst day in more than seven weeks, dragged down by rising new coronavirus cases. The PHLX housing index (HGX) fell. The dollar rose versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.
BRIGHT STAR 
Though the COVID-19 pandemic has bruised the economy, it has boosted the housing market as Americans flee from city centers to the suburbs and low-density areas in search of more space for home offices and schooling. Staggering unemployment, which has left 23.2 million people on jobless benefits, has disproportionately affected low-wage workers.
Home sales have been concentrated in the single-family segment and in the higher price ranges. Both first-time and second-home buyers have been active in the market, with bidding wars reported in some parts of the country.
Last month's decline in new home sales did not change expectations that the housing market likely contributed to a sharp rebound in economic activity in the third quarter. Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.3% annualized rate, which would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of the pandemic.
The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. The government is scheduled to publish its snapshot of third-quarter GDP on Thursday. 
Third-quarter GDP growth was juiced up by government money, which has since run out. That together with the resurgence in coronavirus infections has led to projections of a steep slowdown in activity in the fourth quarter. 
For a graphic on New home sales:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/oakvenxbgpr/nhs.png
""The housing sector should remain supportive of growth at least for the next couple of quarters as strong demand drives new construction,"" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 2.80%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). 
In September, new home sales tumbled 28.9% in the Northeast. They fell 4.7% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions, and dropped 4.1% in the Midwest. But sales increased 3.8% in the West. 
The median new house price increased 3.5% to $326,800 in September from a year ago. New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000 to $399,000 price range.
There were 284,000 new homes on the market last month, up from 282,000 in August. At September's sales pace it would take 3.6 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, up from 3.4 months in August. Just over two-thirds of the homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

""The share of homes sold but not yet started continues to trend upwards,"" said Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington. ""This suggests that homebuilders are struggling to keep up with demand.""

Only 12.9% of respondents believe the country’s economy will strengthen in the next six months, the smallest share since early May, telephone polling shows. That left the Bloomberg Nanos Canadian Confidence Index slightly lower at 51.8. The index has dropped for four straight weeks from a post-pandemic high of 53.2 late last month.
The share of respondents who see the Canadian economy weakening in the next six months rose to 56%, which means pessimists now outnumber optimists about four to one
Weakening sentiment in Canada reflects the new containment measures provinces like Quebec and Ontario have imposed to dampen the second wave of Covid-19. The new lockdown measures include closures of bars, restaurants and gyms as well as limiting the number of people in social gatherings.
As of Sunday, the number of active Covid-19 cases in Canada had more than doubled in the past month to 24,177.
Every week, Nanos Research surveys 250 Canadians for their views on personal finances, job security and their outlook for the economy and real estate prices. Bloomberg publishes four-week rolling averages of the 1,000 responses.
In addition to the Nanos numbers, the impacts of the new restrictions are showing up in high-frequency indicators. Restaurant demand dropped after indoor dining was been banned in several large cities and even outdoor dining was prohibited in parts of Quebec for 28 days, allowing only takeout.
Credit-card spending growth slowed in October after the new measures were implemented, according to reports from Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank. The spending weakness is concentrated among restaurant, travel and entertainment merchants.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government will revise upwards its forecast for growth domestic product (GDP) for 2020 when it presents an update to its estimates this week, a source familiar with the government's forecast told Reuters on Monday.
The government now expects GDP to shrink 5.5% in 2020 compared to a previous estimate for a 5.8% decline, the source said.
This means the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic will be slightly milder than the loss of output caused by the global financial crisis in 2009 when GDP fell by a record 5.7%.
The economy ministry declined to comment and said Economy Minister Peter Altmaier would present the updated forecast on Wednesday.
The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic.
An easing of lockdown measures, coupled with an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus packages, led to a robust recovery in the third quarter.
But a spike in new coronavirus cases has caused concern activity could slow again, and German business morale fell for the first time in six months in October. [L8N2HH24A]

For 2021, the government is still sticking by its previous forecast for GDP growth of 4.4%, the source said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale fell for the first time in six months in October, weighed down by companies' concerns about rising coronavirus infection rates that are making them more cautious about the coming months, a survey showed on Monday.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index fell to 92.7 from a downwardly revised 93.2 in September. A Reuters poll had foreseen a decline to 93.0.
""Companies are considerably more sceptical regarding developments over the coming months,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement. ""In view of rising infection numbers, German business is becoming increasingly worried.""
The cooling of the sentiment in Europe's largest economy coincides with a survey showing British consumer confidence also falling for the first time in six months. 
An easing of lockdown measures, coupled with an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus packages, led to a robust recovery in the third quarter from a 9.7% second-quarter slump, but a spike in new coronavirus cases has caused concern activity could slow again.
The number of confirmed cases in Germany rose by 8,685 to 437,866, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday.
The Ifo survey did not point to another economic slump, said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. ""But as all of Europe is in the second wave of the virus, today's Ifo index definitely marks the end of the rebound and the start of double-dip fears,"" he added.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe forecast fourth-quarter growth of 2.1%, but said that could prove too optimistic if rising infection rates triggered a second lockdown. Rising infections in France, Italy and Spain were also hitting exports, he added.
""The real hit would come if schools and kindergartens had to close,"" he said. ""That would have a massive impact on the economy and industry.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to avoid that scenario and on Saturday reinforced her appeal to Germans to curb social contacts and keep travel to a minimum.
Wohlrabe said the auto industry was one bright spot. ""The carmakers are doing really well at the moment.""
Recent German data has been mixed.
Consumer morale fell heading into November as fears about a second coronavirus wave made Germans less willing to spend, a survey showed last Thursday.

A separate survey on Friday showed private sector activity grew for the fourth month running in October. Manufacturing expansion accelerated, but services activity shrank, suggesting the economy is operating at two speeds.

Concerns about household finances and property values pushed down the index to 101.3, down 1.1 points from September.

Data firm IHS Markit said on Friday its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, rose to a reading of 55.5 this month. That was the highest since February 2019 and was up from 54.3 in September. A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output.
It said some manufacturers and service industry companies noted the coronavirus crisis had weighed on demand. The survey found other companies said a number of clients were holding back on placing orders until after the fiercely contested race to the White House between Republican President Donald Trump and former Vice President and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden.
Growth in foreign client demand also slowed ""notably,"" with manufacturers reporting a renewed contraction in new export orders, IHS Markit said. 
Despite the reported pick-up in business activity, economists are predicting slower economic growth in the fourth quarter after what is believed to have been a record performance in the third quarter, thanks to a more than $3 trillion rescue package early this year for businesses and the unemployed.
But the fiscal stimulus is gone and new COVID-19 cases are rising around the country, which could lead to state and local government restrictions or more people shunning establishments like restaurants and bars, and undercut consumer spending.
The survey's flash composite new orders index dipped to 54.3 this month from a reading of 54.8 in September. 
Still, confidence among businesses is steadily improving.
The survey's flash services sector PMI rose to 56 this month, a 20-month high, from a reading of 54.6 in September.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 54.6 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
A measure of new businesses in the services sector dropped to 54.3 from a reading of 55.0 in September.

Manufacturing was steady this month. The survey's flash manufacturing PMI inched up to a reading of 53.3 from 53.2 in September. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11.3% of the economy, rising to 53.4 in October. A measure of new orders received by factories increased to a reading of 54.2 from 53.6 in September.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone economic activity slipped back into decline this month as a second wave of the coronavirus sweeps across the continent, heightening expectations for a double-dip recession, surveys showed on Friday.
Renewed restrictions to control the pandemic forced many businesses in the bloc's dominant service industry to limit operations and nearly 90% of economists polled by Reuters this week said there was a high risk the coronavirus resurgence would halt the nascent euro zone economic recovery. [ECILT/EU]
""The euro zone PMI confirms that the second wave of the coronavirus is weighing more and more on the economy. A double-dip in the fourth quarter is becoming more likely at this rate,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
IHS Markit's Flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, fell to 49.4 from September's final reading of 50.4.
That was below the 50-mark separating growth from contraction and only fractionally better than the 49.3 predicted in a Reuters poll.
That headline PMI was dragged down by the service industry's PMI, which sank more than expected to 46.2 from 48.0.
""The further decline in the euro zone Composite PMI in October adds to the evidence that the second wave of infections, and the new wave of containment measures, is taking a heavy toll on the economy,"" said Jack Allen-Reynolds at Capital Economics.
Friday's surveys showed the bloc's economy is running at two speeds, with manufacturing benefiting from strong global demand and services struggling to remain active as lockdowns force consumers to stay home and businesses to close.
Echoing the divide between services and manufacturing, German factories powered ahead this month, while in France activity contracted as a resurgence of the virus hit the euro zone's second-biggest economy.
Outside the currency bloc and now outside the European Union, Britain's economic recovery also lost more momentum as restrictions hit businesses in the hospitality and transport sectors.

WINTER IS COMING
It will likely be a chilling winter for the job market which until now has been shielded by government furlough schemes as the uncertain outlook meant firms reduced headcount for an eighth month.
The composite employment subindex nudged up slightly, but remained in negative territory, while the Reuters poll concluded that the bloc's jobless rate would not peak for at least six months.
With infection rates and the death toll rising, optimism fell. The services business expectations index dropped to 54.6 from 59.2, its lowest since May when the initial lockdowns were being eased.
A 750 billion euro stimulus plan agreed by the European Union in July to support its suffering economies will be delayed, a senior diplomat said on Thursday, which is also likely to have a negative impact on sentiment.
Still, factories fared much better than expected. The flash manufacturing PMI climbed to a 26-month high of 54.4 and was far above the median forecast in a Reuters poll.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to its highest since early 2018.
Strong demand for manufactured goods meant factories were also able to increase their prices for the first time since mid-2019, albeit only slightly.

That will provide some relief to policymakers at the European Central Bank as inflation, which they want close to 2%, has been negative for two months.

An early ""flash"" reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a gauge of private sector growth, fell to a four-month low of 52.9 in October from 56.5 in September.
A Reuters poll of economists pointed to a smaller decline to 53.9.
""The pace of UK economic growth slowed in October to the weakest since the recovery from the national COVID-19 lockdown began,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
""The weakening is most pronounced in the hospitality and transport sectors, as firms reported falling demand due to renewed lockdown measures and customers being deterred by worries over rising case numbers,"" he added.
The survey added to signs that the economic recovery is fading as COVID-19 cases surge, prompting some parts of the country to reimpose health restrictions that require pubs and restaurants to close early and limit social gatherings.
Britain's economy shrank 20% in the second quarter, the largest decline of any major advanced economy, and official data has shown that the initially rapid recovery was already beginning to falter in August.
Since then COVID cases have risen sharply, and on Thursday finance minister Rishi Sunak was forced to expand support for businesses struggling to pay their staff at a time when he had hoped to wean firms off state support.
New orders across British businesses fell in October for the first time since June, survey compiler IHS Markit said.
The services PMI, which covers the bulk of the economy, fell to 52.3 in October from 56.1 in September, its lowest level since June. The survey pointed to a month of heavy job losses.
The performance of the much smaller manufacturing sector was better, although similarly marked by a sharp drop in employment.

The factory PMI fell to 53.3 from 54.1, its lowest since July, though optimism about future output struck a five-year high in October.

But retail sales likely fell for the seventh straight month last month, suggesting a patch recovery as the pandemic hammered the broader economy. 
Industrial output is forecast to have risen 3.2% in September from the previous month, the poll of 16 economists showed on Friday, but the pace of increase has been slowing down from a record 8.7% jump in July.
""We expect factory output grew led by autos,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""Exports are clearly recovering on a pickup in the economy overseas. So factory output is expected to recover led by exports.""
Retail sales are expected to have fallen 7.7% in September from a year earlier as the pandemic kept consumers at home. 
The trade ministry will announce retail sales data at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Thursday, October 29 (2350 GMT Wednesday) and factory output data on Friday. 
The nation's jobless rate probably inched up to 3.1% in September from 3.0% in August, and the jobs-to-applicants ratio, a gauge of the availability of jobs, likely held steady at 1.04.
One analyst said some more people have started looking for jobs, which brings them back into the data but is part of the reason for a slightly higher unemployment rate as they haven't found jobs yet.
Tokyo's core consumer price (CPI) index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, likely fell 0.5% in October from a year earlier led by energy price falls, the poll found. 
The government will publish Tokyo core CPI and jobs data at 8:30 a.m. Japan time on Friday. 

The poll also found the Bank of Japan would maintain its policy interest rate at minus 0.1%, and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield target at around 0% when it holds a policy meeting on Oct. 28-29.

Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, slipped to 54.5 in October from 54.7 the previous month.
The reading surpassed the consensus forecast of analysts polled by Reuters, who expected a decline to 53.2, and was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
Manufacturing proved robust, with the flash PMI rising to 58.0, its highest level since April 2018. The service sector contracted, however, with the flash PMI dipping to 48.9.
Markit economist Phil Smith said the survey data pointed to resilience in the economy in the face of a second wave of coronavirus cases, with the decline in service sector activity quite limited so far while manufacturing remained solid. 
""It's increasingly looking like a two-speed economy,"" he said. ""Manufacturing businesses have been able to continue operating with less disruption from any new restrictions than many of their service sector counterparts, whilst at the same time reaping the benefits of a resurgence in global goods trade.""
""As more manufacturers get back or close to pre-COVID-19 levels of activity, however, sustaining growth is going to become more challenging,"" Smith added.
The German government expects gross domestic product to shrink in 2020 by 5.8% before rebounding by 4.4% next year.

Berlin has since March implemented an array of rescue and stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing of some 218 billion euros, which it hopes will help consumers and companies get out of the crisis more quickly.

The volume of goods sold in stores and online gained 1.5% from August, the Office for National Statistics said Friday, beating economists estimates for a reading of 0.2%. Sales were 17.4% higher in the third quarter following a lockdown-induced slump in the previous period.
While the report will be welcome for policy makers hoping to support the economy going into winter, there are already signs that rising unemployment and the prospect of a messy divorce from the European Union at the end of the year.
Household confidence was starting to retrench even before the virus flared up again, forcing many areas into renewed restrictions, a report by GfK showed Friday. The number of job cuts jumped the most on record in the June-August quarter.
Nevertheless, retail sales in September were 5.5% higher than in February, before the pandemic struck. They were led by home improvement items and garden centers. Grocery stores also saw an increase, while clothing sales dropped.
Online sales were particularly strong, rising to 27.5% of the total compared with 20.1% in February. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). has said it will hire an additional 7,000 people for permanent jobs in the U.K. this year to deal with the surge in demand.
On Thursday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced a significant increase in U.K. government support, including more wage subsidies and grants for businesses. Most of the generous job-supporting measures introduced at the height of lockdown are due to expire this month.
Even so, Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR) has announced it’s moving jobs to Singapore.  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) is restructuring to cut its workforce by 35,000 over the next three years. Cineworld Group Plc is closing its cinemas as moviegoers are forced to stay home.
September was “Probably this year’s peak, given the outlook for falling incomes and renewed lockdowns,” said Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Economics.
Several Bank of England policy makers say they stand ready to increase stimulus to support the economy. The next decision falls on Nov. 5."

LONDON (Reuters) - British retail sales beat expectations last month and grew for a fifth month in a row, capping a record quarter of growth that took total sales volumes to 5.5% above their level before the pandemic.
Retail sales volumes grew by 1.5% in September alone and are 4.7% higher than a year earlier, taking the annual rate above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Strong household demand has been the mainstay of Britain's recovery from the initial shock of the coronavirus lockdown, when output contracted by 20%, more than in any other major advanced economy.
Britain's economy is set to record a rapid rebound for the third quarter, and Friday's retail sales data showed a record 17.4% increase in sales volumes for the period.
However, rising coronavirus restrictions are hurting consumer morale and weighing on the broader economy.
""Total consumer spending will probably start to stutter over the next few months as the furlough scheme ends and unemployment rises, despite the increased generosity of the Job Support Scheme,"" said Thomas Pugh of Capital Economics.

British consumer sentiment fell this month by the most since a slump at the start of the coronavirus pandemic as lockdown restrictions tightened across much of the country, according to a long-running survey published on Friday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices slipped for the second consecutive month in September, a sign that a coronavirus-induced demand downturn is piling deflationary pressure on the world's third-largest economy already blighted by recession.
The data is likely to heighten expectations the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will maintain its massive stimulus programme to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, analysts said.
But analysts mainly blamed the drop on a government campaign aimed at promoting domestic travel, underscoring the tricky task of supporting the economy without pushing inflation further away from the central bank's 2% target.
""The declines in August and September were caused largely by the government's travel discount campaign,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Weak service-sector demand could exert further downward pressure on prices at least until the coronavirus is contained.""
The nationwide core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes energy, fell 0.3% in September from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday. That compared with a median market forecast for a 0.4% decline.
When stripping away the effect of the government's travel discount campaign, core consumer prices were flat in September from a year earlier, the data showed.
The data will be among factors the BOJ will scrutinise at next week's rate review. People familiar with BOJ thinking have told Reuters the bank is likely to slash its economic and price forecasts for the current fiscal year.
Japan's economy suffered its biggest postwar slump in the second quarter of the year, and analysts expect any rebound to be modest due to soft consumption and capital spending.
While demand for durable goods is picking up, social distancing policies and fears over a resurgence in infections continue to weigh on service consumption.

As part of efforts to rescue Japan's ailing tourism sector, the government in July started a campaign offering discounts for domestic travel that is set to last until January next year.

A gauge of prices excluding fresh food fell 0.3% from a year earlier, largely reflecting the impact of government travel subsidies, following a 0.4% drop in August, the ministry of internal affairs reported Friday. Analysts had forecast a 0.4% decline.
The result comes ahead of a meeting next week where the Bank of Japan will give its latest inflation forecasts. While the latest data may help ease concerns of a descent into longer-term deflation for the time being, additional factors are expected to weigh on prices from next month.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",UK consumer sentiment falls by most since start of pandemic: GfK,"LONDON (Reuters) - British consumer sentiment fell this month by the most since a slump at the start of the coronavirus pandemic as lockdown restrictions tightened across much of the country, according to a long-running survey published on Friday.
The GfK Consumer Confidence Index tumbled to -31 in October, its lowest level since late May and down sharply from a nine-month high of -25 in September, as well as being below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
The six-point fall in the index in the space of a month was the largest since the 25 point decline recorded just after the start of the lockdown in March.
""There's a worrying threat of a double-dip in consumer confidence as concerns for our personal financial situation and even deeper fears over the state of the UK economy drag the index down,"" GfK director Joe Staton said.
The index showed an especially large 12-point decline in households' outlook for the economy over the next 12 months.
Polling took place between Oct. 1 and Oct. 14 - before big cities such as Manchester moved to the highest tier of COVID lockdown - and GfK warned that sentiment risked falling further.
Strong household demand has been the mainstay of Britain's recovery from the initial shock of the coronavirus lockdown, when output contracted by 20%, more than in any other major advanced economy.
Retail sales in July and August were above pre-pandemic levels, and the number of house purchases in September was close to its level a year earlier.
Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane said on Thursday that consumer spending had been unexpectedly resilient in Britain, and noted that in the United States a second wave of COVID cases had done little to dent spending there.
But other economists worry that a big part of the rebound has been driven by pent-up demand which is likely to fade, especially if unemployment climbs steeply in the final months of the year like the BoE forecast in August.
Britain's main furlough programme expires at the end of this month, and finance minister Rishi Sunak announced a fresh set of changes to its replacement on Thursday following warnings from business that it did too little to preserve jobs.

GfK conducted the survey on behalf of the European Commission.

Inflation is set to weaken markedly next year as a sluggish economic recovery and rising unemployment exert downward pressure on wages and consumer spending. The Reserve Bank in August projected inflation would slow to just 0.3% by the end of 2021, and has signaled it is prepared to provide more stimulus through negative interest rates if needed. It targets inflation of 1-3%.

The companies signed up for $8.7 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, down from $10 billion a year earlier. Borrowings in September rose 24% from the previous month.
""Despite the drop in September year-over-year new business, a look at the data beginning with the advent of the pandemic in February shows that the industry, in general, is holding its own,"" ELFA Chief Executive Officer Ralph Petta said.
""Anecdotal evidence from some ELFA member companies indicates they are enjoying a very strong year.""
Washington-based ELFA, which reports economic activity for the nearly $1-trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals rose to 72.9% in September from 71% in August.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States.
The index is based on a survey of 25 members, including Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Dell Technologies Inc (N:DELL),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, but remained very high as the labor market recovery shows signs of strain amid a relentless COVID-19 pandemic and ebbing fiscal stimulus.
While other data on Thursday showed home sales racing to a more than 14-year high in September, economic activity is slowing heading into the fourth quarter. A measure of the economy's prospects increased moderately last month.
The slow and uneven recovery from the worst economic downturn in at least 73 years and uncontrolled coronavirus crisis could cost Republican President Donald Trump a second four-year term in the White House when Americans vote on Nov. 3. Trump is trailing former Vice President and Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden in national opinion polls. 
""There are still millions and millions on the nation's unemployment rolls because many of the jobs lost during the steepest downturn in economic history have not yet returned,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Time will tell if the still-record number of people out of work will act as a brake on the economic recovery or whether the economy's fortunes depend more on the course of the virus."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 55,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 for the week ended Oct. 17. Data for the prior week was revised to show 56,000 fewer applications received than previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 860,000 claims in the latest week. California, the most populous state in the nation, resumed the processing of new applications after a two-week pause in late September to combat fraud. 
Unadjusted claims fell 73,125 to 756,617 last week. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state jobless programs, 1.1 million people filed claims last week.
For a graphic on Jobless claims:
https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/yxmpjjjlopr/joblessclaims.png
First-time claims have been stuck above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though they have declined from a record 6.867 million in March. A more than $3 trillion rescue package early this year provided a lifeline for many businesses, allowing them to keep workers on payrolls. It also lifted economic activity from the recession, which started in February. 
Though Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are working out details of a new relief package, a deal is unlikely before the Nov. 3 presidential election amid stiff opposition in the Republican-controlled Senate.
With funding depleted, businesses, especially in the transportation industry, are either laying off or furloughing workers as demand remains subdued. More pain lies ahead amid a resurgence in new coronavirus cases around the country, which could lead to state and local government restrictions or more people shunning establishments like restaurants and bars.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
SOFT PAYROLLS NUMBER?
Last week's claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of October's employment report. Payrolls increased by 661,000 jobs in September, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May.
""Elevated initial jobless claims and the unwind of temporary Census hiring means we could get a soft payrolls number,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""A weak figure would probably be a more significant catalyst for politicians to deliver action on fiscal stimulus.""
Though the claims report showed a further decline in the number of people on unemployment rolls in early October, that was in part due to millions exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to six months in most states.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 1.024 million to 8.373 million in the week ending Oct. 10, the lowest in nearly seven months.
At least 3.296 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Oct. 3, up 509,823 from the prior week. Economists said claims for extended benefits, which expire in December, were understated.
""Today's report does not include 600,000 recipients in Florida listed on the state's dashboard, as well as workers in major states like Washington and Texas who report delays of up to one month between programs,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York. 
A staggering 23.2 million people were on unemployment benefits at the beginning of October.
Unemployment has, however, disproportionately affected lower-wage workers. With many higher-paid employees working from home, there has been a housing market boom, with home sales jumping 9.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million units in September, the highest level since May 2006. 
For a graphic on Existing home sales:

But the housing market's strength is not enough to offset weakness elsewhere. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose 0.7% last month, slowing from a 1.4% increase in August.

That is consistent with economists' projections for slower growth in the fourth quarter after what is believed to have been a record performance in the third quarter.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","Investors pile into options to bet on rate rise, Treasury weakness","By Karen Brettell
(Reuters) - Investors have been buying options on eurodollar futures and interest rate swaps to bet on higher rates and falling U.S. Treasury debt prices if lawmakers pass more fiscal stimulus after next month’s presidential election, if not before.
Investors are betting that eurodollars, which reflect shorter-term rate expectations, could fall in price on a growing expectation of a Federal Reserve rate hike as soon as 2023.
This can be seen in increased demand for put options that pay off when prices fall, and higher implied volatility, a key component of options pricing that rises and falls with demand.
“The very front-end has been awoken from its slumber. There are a number of options trades going through, particularly in the eurodollar space, targeting a tightening of policy in 2023/2024,” said Michael de Pass, global head of U.S. Treasury trading at Citadel Securities.
Short-term rate markets have been moribund for months as the Fed commits to holding rates near zero to tackle economic weakness after businesses shut down to try to stem the spread of COVID-19.
“We were coming off an incredibly low base for implied volatility and that’s ticked up a bit over the last couple of weeks,” de Pass said.
The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA MOVE index, a measure of Treasury market volatility, has jumped to around 60, from a record low of 37 reached in September. It remains well below the high of 164 reached at the peak of market volatility in March.
The White House and Democrats in the U.S. Congress are in discussions about pumping trillions more dollars into the economy.
Even if a deal is not reached, investors see a jump in spending as likely after the Nov. 3 election, with a larger bill more likely if Democrats win control of the U.S Senate.
Trading volumes in options on Eurodollar futures have jumped to 7.67 million contracts so far this month, more than were traded in each of August and September, though volumes remain lower than earlier this year, data from the CME Group (NASDAQ:CME) show.
Put options make up 63% of October's activity, up from 42% of volumes in June, and 30% in March, CME data show.
Options referencing Eurodollar futures that mature in 2023 and 2024 also make up 36% of October's total options trading volume, up from 16% in June and only 2% in March, CME said. 
Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said there has also been an increase in bearish trades placed in swaptions, or options based on interest rate swaps. Swaps are exchanges of interest rate payments and are used to bet on or protect against a rate change.
“With the rise in yields people are trying to gauge if perhaps we could see an earlier start to Fed rate hikes than what the market’s currently pricing in,” she said.
The predominance of short positions, however, could lead to investors taking profits during any further bout of weakness, which in turn could cap the extent of yield increases, Rajappa said.
Benchmark 10-year yields hit a four-month high of 0.853% on Thursday and five-year yields reached 0.378%, up from a record low of 0.189% in August.
Analysts caution that ongoing economic weakness and global demand for yield could limit any large increase in bond yields.
The Fed is also expected to shift more of its bond purchases to longer-dated debt if it sees yields rising faster than economic growth warrants.
But options are ""a cheap hedge,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York. Yields “tend to move in pretty defined patterns in the sense they tend to grind, grind, grind lower, and then they pop higher on something.”

""It's hard to hedge those types of moves and you are only able to do it in the options market,"" he said.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales blow past expectations in September,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales surged to a more than 14-year high in September, boosted by historically low mortgage rates, but record high prices amid a shortage of houses could curb further gains.
The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing home sales jumped 9.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.54 million units last month, the highest level since May 2006. Data for August was revised down to a rate of 5.98 million units from the previously reported 6 million units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales increasing 5% to a rate of 6.30 million units in September. 
Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, vaulted 20.9% on a year-on-year basis in September. 
Sales increased in all four regions and were concentrated in the upper price end of the market. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a migration to the suburbs and low-density areas as Americans seek more space for home offices and schooling, making the housing market the star of the economy's recovery from the recession, which started in February. Staggering unemployment, which has left 23.2 million people on unemployment benefits, has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically young and renters.
But housing market activity could slow in the fourth quarter, with applications for loans to purchase of home falling in the past four weeks, likely because of the tight inventory. 
There were 1.47 million previously owned homes on the market in September, the fewest since the NAR started tracking the series in 1982, down 19.2% from a year ago. As a result, the median existing house price soared 14.8% from a year ago to $311,800 in September.
At September's sales pace, it would take 2.7 months to exhaust the current inventory, the shortest since 1982. That was down from 3.0 months in August and 4.0 months in September 2019. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

1314,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 09:18AM ET</span>",California’s Data Revisions Paint Less-Dire Picture of U.S. Jobs,"(Bloomberg) -- The number of Californians who filed for unemployment benefits the week ended Oct. 10 was almost almost a quarter less than previously reported, according to Labor Department figures that show a better trajectory than previously thought for the U.S. labor market because of the state’s size.
For the three weeks spanning late September and early October, federal reports on jobless claims showed California’s number of applications for state benefits stuck at the mid-September level of 226,179 while the state paused processing to whittle down a massive backlog and improve fraud prevention. That skewed the national reading higher because it didn’t reflect the true picture of claims in the most populous state, which is home to one of eight Americans.
A technical note included with Labor’s claims report on Thursday said California completed its pause in claims processing and resumed reporting actual unemployment insurance filings data based on weekly activity. The revised state data showed claims in California at 171,220 for the week ended Sept. 26 and 148,213 for the following week -- both significant drops from the previously reported placeholder number of 226,179. Thursday’s main U.S. report showed 176,083 Californians filed initial claims during the week ended Oct. 10.

The revisions don’t alter the broader picture of a still-struggling labor market, where the number of Americans filing for unemployment each week remains far above pre-pandemic levels. But if the national numbers had reflected an accurate count in California, the improvement would show greater momentum from week to week.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits fell to 787,000 last week, the lowest since April, but remained at levels indicating that the recovery in the labor market is struggling for momentum as the coronavirus pandemic enters its first full winter.
Economists had forecast a decline to 860,000. The prior week's figure was revised down to 842,000 from an initially reported 898,000.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, fell sharply for a second straight week to 8.373 million. The previous week's figure was revised down to 9.397 million. Continuing claims are falling in part because many people have exhausted their eligibility for regular state benefits.
The Labor Department said that California had completed its pause in processing of initial claims and had resumed reporting new claims as part of the national total. The report reflected the count for California for the current week and revisions to the two previous weeks. Earlier this month, the state said it needed to suspend data filings in order to reduce its claims processing backlog and implement fraud prevention technology.
""The return of California to the mix with better data revised down the level of claims for previous weeks but not as much as hoped,"" said Grant Thornton chief economist Diane Swonk via Twitter. 
The report comes as talks in Washington over a economic stimulus deal drag on amid doubts over whether the negotiations would continue or pause until after the Nov. 3 election. The number of all people claiming unemployment-related benefits fell by just over 1 million to 23.15 million, as of October 3, the last date for which such data are available.
Grant Thornton's Swonk noted that the number of those applying for extended unemployment benefits increased, which she said was  ""a sign of deeper scarring and an inability to recall more workers.""
""This is starting to look like a more traditional and longer recession, which bolsters the case for more stimulus now,"" Swonk added."

The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) monthly order book balance - the difference between factories reporting a rise and a fall in orders - became less negative in October at -34, compared with -48 in September.
While still historically low, it was the best reading since March and above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to a figure of -45.
""Conditions remain tough in the manufacturing sector, with output and orders still down on the quarter, albeit to a lesser degree,"" said CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith.
The CBI's quarterly gauge of business optimism rose to its highest level since January.

China's economy in the July to September quarter expanded by 4.9% from a year earlier, weaker than analyst expectations but faster than the second quarter's 3.2% growth.
For the first nine months of the year, fiscal revenues fell 6.4% from a year earlier to 14.10 trillion yuan ($2.12 trillion), while fiscal expenditures dropped 1.9% to 17.519 trillion yuan, the ministry said.

""The decline in accumulative fiscal revenues will gradually moderate,"" he said.
The government is on track to cut taxes and fees by more than 2.5 trillion yuan in 2020, including 1.88 trillion yuan in the first eight months, the ministry said.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>","UK borrowing exceeds forecasts, debt highest since 1960","By David Milliken and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government borrowing in the first half of the financial year was more than six times higher than before the COVID pandemic, official figures showed on Wednesday, taking public debt to its highest since 1960.
Public borrowing in September alone totalled 36.101 billion pounds ($46.90 billion), above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists, although August's figure was revised down by more than 5 billion pounds to 30.113 billion pounds.
The increased borrowing took total public debt further above the 2 trillion pound mark to 2.060 trillion pounds or 103.5% of GDP, its highest on this measure since 1960, the Office for National Statistics said.
Driven by a surge in coronavirus-related spending and a fall in tax revenue after the biggest economic hit since at least the 1920s, borrowing from April to September totalled 208.5 billion pounds, over six times more than for the same time in 2019.
Britain's Office for Budget Responsibility predicted in August that borrowing would reach a record 372 billion pounds by the end of this financial year, equivalent to 18.9% of gross domestic product, the most since World War Two. 
Borrowing to date is below what the OBR pencilled in for this point in the tax year, though the ONS data does not yet include the cost of defaults on government-backed COVID loans which the OBR has factored in.
Spending risks rising again in the second half of the financial year as lockdown restrictions return to much of the United Kingdom, pressuring the government to offer extra support to closed businesses and their workers.
""The OBR's forecast for public borrowing of 372 billion still looks about right,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded Britain's sovereign credit rating on Friday to the same level as Belgium's and the Czech Republic's, warning that Britain ""effectively has no fiscal anchor"". 
But financial markets have shrugged off rising borrowing, and 10-year government borrowing costs (GB10YT=RR) of around 0.2% are only slightly above an all-time low struck at the start of the pandemic. 
Economists polled by Reuters expect the Bank of England to launch a further 100 billion pounds of bond purchases next month, adding to the 300 billion pounds announced since March.
Britain's government had aimed to set out a three-year plan for public spending next month, but said on Wednesday this would only cover one year due to COVID uncertainty, with exceptions for schools, healthcare and some infrastructure.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said after the data his ""enduring priority"" would be to protect jobs during the crisis.
""Over time and as the economy recovers, the government will take the necessary steps to ensure the long-term health of the public finances,"" he said.

Separately, the Office for National Statistics said annual consumer price inflation in September rose to 0.5% in September from 0.2% in August, when it had been reduced by a temporary scheme to promote dining in restaurants.

1319,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 10:36PM ET</span>",Australian Retail Sales Drop as Household Goods Give Back Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- Australian consumer spending fell in September, the first back-to-back monthly decline this year, as demand eased in industries like food and household goods that have remained buoyant during Covid restrictions.
Preliminary retail sales slid 1.5% from the previous month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday in Sydney. All states and territories, bar the Northern Territory, fell in September. Victoria state recorded a small monthly decline, following a large drop in August, the bureau said.
“Food retailing, household goods retailing, and other retailing, which includes online only retailers, recorded falls this month,” said Ben James, director of Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys at the ABS. “These industries have recorded elevated levels of turnover during the Covid-19 pandemic.”
The data span a period when Victoria remained under hard lockdown to combat a renewed outbreak of coronavirus -- and it remains the only state or territory to be trading below September 2019 levels. While Australian households’ consumption has been constrained by virus-related restrictions, their incomes have risen due to huge government stimulus and central bank easing.
That’s left the savings ratio at the highest level since the 1970s.
Sales of clothing, footwear and personal accessories all fell last month, according to the ABS. This was partly offset by rises in department stores, and cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services, which recorded gains after significant falls in August, the bureau said.
Slump Down Under
While Australia tipped into its first recession in almost three decades due to the coronavirus requiring large tracts of the economy to be shuttered, the hit has been less than in many developed-world peers. Yet, unemployment is tipped to rise further as Victoria reopens and government support programs wind down.
Retail sales have been volatile through the Covid period, posting a record decline in April when national lockdown peaked, before rebounding by a record in May as restrictions were eased. Sales have also benefited from panic buying at supermarkets and households spending on goods for their home.
Australia is now entering the Southern Hemisphere summer, which may provide some respite from the virus. This contrasts with weather conditions in Europe and the U.S., with the former already experiencing a sharp increase in cases.
Consumer confidence Down Under surged further this month, with optimists now outweighing pessimists, following an expansionary budget and greater containment of the virus. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to ease policy further next month, with the key interest rate currently at 0.25% and a yield target on the three-year government bond at the same level.

Exports fell 5.8% in the first 20 days of the month from a year earlier, according to customs office data released Wednesday. the value of average daily shipments still rose 5.9%, as the period had 1.5 fewer business days compared with last year.
South Korea’s trade data serve as a barometer of global demand. The rise in daily shipments suggests overseas demand is slowly picking up as countries adapt to life with the coronavirus.
South Korea’s memory chips have been among the biggest beneficiaries from the pandemic-driven increase in remote work and schooling arrangements. The country’s exports are also expected to get a boost from a broadening economic recovery in China, its biggest trade partner.
“The rise in Korea’s main products such as semiconductors should help keep the overall exports on the rise,” said Lee Jae-sun, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment Co. “Given China’s speedier recovery than other countries, Korea should see its exports of intermediate goods gradually increasing.”
South Korea’s semiconductor shipments increased 12% during Oct. 1-20, despite the smaller number of working days, while exports to China fell 4.6%.
The country’s national Chuseok holiday fell on Sept. 30-Oct. 2, as opposed to mid-September last year, likely disturbing trade performance at the start of October.
Exports to the U.S. declined 2.3%, while shipments to the European Union rose 14% and those to Japan dropped 17%. Overseas shipments of cars fell 7.6%, while oil products decreased 42%. Sales of computer devices rose 11%.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","U.S. single-family homebuilding, permits surge to more than 13-year high","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. single-family homebuilding raced to a more than 13-year high in September, cementing the housing market's status as the star of the economic recovery amid record-low mortgage rates and a migration to the suburbs and low-density areas in search of more room for home offices and schooling. 
The report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday also showed building permits and housing completions scaling levels last seen in 2007. That could help to ease an acute shortage of homes for sale, which has fueled house price inflation.
The data reinforced expectations that the economy rebounded sharply in the third quarter after suffering its deepest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter. But the recovery from the COVID-19 recession has entered a period of uncertainty, with fiscal stimulus depleted.
""It appears the strength in housing is being driven by the first-time home buyer coming off the sidelines and taking advantage of historically low mortgage rates along with the opportunity to purchase a home in a location they might not otherwise consider outside of the current work-from-home environment,"" said Scott Volling, principal at PwC in Atlanta.
Single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, jumped 8.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.108 million units last month, the highest level since June 2007. That offset a 16.3% decline in starts for the volatile multi-family segment to a pace of 307,000 units. 
Overall, housing starts increased 1.9% to a rate of 1.415 million units last month. Groundbreaking activity rose in the West, South and Northeast, but fell in the Midwest.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts increasing to a rate of 1.457 million units in September. 
Homebuilding advanced 11.1% year-on-year, with single-family starts surging 22.3%. Further gains in single-family home construction are likely, with building permits shooting up 7.8% to a rate of 1.119 million units last month, the highest level since March 2007. 
Builders are taking advantage of the strong demand, lean inventories and low mortgage rates to ramp-up construction. A survey on Monday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders hit a record high in October. 
But builders said constructing affordable homes was becoming increasingly challenging because ""shortages of lots, labor, lumber and other key building materials are lengthening construction times.""
The PHLX housing index was trading higher, outperforming a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar dipped versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
BRIGHT SPOT
The housing market has been a bright spot in the economy despite 25.3 million people being on unemployment benefits. Unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically young and renters. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.81%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
The Commerce Department report suggested a swift turnaround in the housing market in the third quarter after an unprecedented collapse in the April-June quarter. Data last week showed an acceleration in retail sales in September. 
Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.2% annualized rate, which would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of the coronavirus. 
The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947. With government money gone, growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been slashed to as low as a 3% rate from above a 10% pace.
""We expect some moderation in the pace of housing starts in the fourth quarter as a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, a slow recovery and a weak labor market take a toll on the resilient housing sector,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, in the immediate term, the risk may be for further upside surprises.""
Overall permits for future homebuilding increased 5.2% to a rate of 1.553 million units in September, the highest since March 2007. Multi-family building permits slipped 0.9% to a rate of 434,000 units.
""The relative strength of single-family construction compared to multifamily units could partly reflect a shift in housing demand away from multifamily structures in more densely populated cities and towards single-family units in suburbs and less populated areas,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in New York. ""This trend would also be consistent with softer rents but resilient house prices recently.""
Housing completions vaulted 15.3% to a rate of 1.413 million units last month, the highest since August 2007. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to close the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction was unchanged at a rate of 1.209 million units.

""We expect housing starts for the year to total around 1.4 million units,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio. ""This is one of those very rare periods when starts will rise during a recession year.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic recovery accelerated in the third quarter as consumers shook off their coronavirus caution, although the weaker-than-expected headline growth suggested persistent risks for one of the few drivers of global demand.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.9% in July-September from a year earlier, official data showed on Monday, slower than the 5.2% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll but faster than the second quarter's 3.2% growth.
""China's economy remains on the recovery path, driven by a rebound in exports. Consumer spending is also headed in the right direction, but we cannot say it has completely shaken off the drag caused by the coronavirus,"" said Yoshikiyo Shimamine, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo.
""There is a risk that the return of lockdowns in Europe and another wave of infections in the United States will hurt consumer spending and trigger more job losses, which would be a negative for China's economy.""
The weaker-than-expected headline figures weighed on China's yuan  and mainland stock benchmarks (SSEC) (CSI300) and capped broader market gains in Asia.
The world's second-largest economy grew 0.7% in the first nine months from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said.
Graphic - China's V-shaped recovery? https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-ECONOMY/GDP/qzjpqaewypx/chart.png
Policymakers globally are pinning their hopes on a robust recovery in China to help restart demand as economies struggle with heavy lockdowns and a second wave of coronavirus infections.
China has partially emerged from a record slump caused by coronavirus shutdowns in the first months of the year.
NBS spokeswoman Liu Aihua warned that growth remained patchy.
""Internally, the economy is still in the process of recovery,"" she told a briefing in Beijing. ""Some or most of the indicators have not returned to the normal growth level, and some of the cumulative growth rate has also declined.""
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 2.7% in the third quarter, the NBS said, compared with expectations for a 3.2% rise and an 11.5% rise in the previous quarter.
But despite the headline disappointment, analysts were encouraged by a broader upturn in consumption and continued factory strength.
Retail sales grew 3.3% in September from a year earlier, speeding up from a modest 0.5% rise in August and posting the fastest growth since December 2019. Industrial output grew 6.9% after a 5.6% rise in August, showing the factory sector's recovery was gaining momentum.
Fixed-asset investment rose 0.8% in the first nine months from a year earlier, returning to year-to-date growth for the first time this year.
In the property sector, investment rose 12% in September from a year earlier, the fastest pace in nearly 1-1/2 years, providing a key support for broader investment.
The government has rolled out a raft of measures including more fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the coronavirus-hit economy and support employment.
While the central bank stepped up policy support after widespread travel restrictions choked economic activity, it has more recently held off on further easing.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast an expansion of 1.9% for China for 2020, which is close to the central bank's own projection of 2%.
That would make China the only major economy expected to report growth in 2020, albeit at the slowest annual pace since 1976, the final year of Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. 
CONSUMERS STEP UP
China's retail spending has lagged the comeback in factory activity this year as heavy job losses and persistent worries about infections kept consumers at home, even as restrictions lifted.
However, recent indicators suggest consumer activity is now turning around.
In the travel sector, domestic passenger flights in September beat their COVID-19 levels, a sign that that segment of the market is approaching a full recovery, even as international borders remain largely shut.
Auto sales marked a sixth straight month of gains in September while  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) China vehicle sales jumped 25% in the third quarter from a year earlier.
The breakdown of GDP showed final consumption accounted for 1.7 percentage points growth, while capital formation accounted for 2.6 percentage points and net exports contributed 0.6 percentage points, NBS said.
The coronavirus outbreak, which caused China's first contraction since at least 1992 in the first quarter, is now largely under control in the country, although there has been a small resurgence of cases in the eastern province of Shandong.
""The single most important thing for the Chinese economy in the coming months is whether service consumption can catch up,"" said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Capital in Hong Kong.

Investing.com – Chinese quarterly growth data for the third quarter showed a continuing economic recovery from the impact of COVID-19. However, overall growth missed forecasts, indicating that challenges remain in the road ahead for the country.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics released earlier in the day showed that GDP grew 4.9% year-on-year, smaller than the 5.2% predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com but larger than the second quarter’s 3.2% growth. The GDP’s quarter-on-quarter growth stood at 2.7%, which also missed the forecast 3.2% growth and much smaller than the second quarter's 11.5% growth.
Industrial production grew 6.9% year-on-year in September, beating the forecast 5.8% growth and August’s 5.6% growth. Retail sales grew 3.3% year-on-year in the same month, also beating the forecast 1.8% and August’s 0.5% growth. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, down from the previous quarter’s 5.6% reading.
“The rebound in Q3 GDP was less strong than expected, but was still a decent 4.9% year-on-year … September data beat expectations, suggesting a pickup in momentum towards the latter part of the third quarter ... The pickup in momentum was broad-based, which bodes well for the fourth quarter outlook,” Westpac head of macro strategy for Asia Frances Cheung told Reuters.
However, as the number of  COVID-19 cases continues to rise globally and new restrictive measures in Europe and the U.S. revive fears of fresh lockdowns, the data comes as a disappointment to investors who were expecting the data to show a robust recovery.
China has seen a steady recovery from the economic impact of the lockdowns seen during the first quarter to curb the spread of COVID-19, and the uptick in retail sales also pointed to increasing consumption in the third quarter. The government has also rolled out measures, including increased fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks’ reserve requirements, to aid the economic recovery and support employment. China is the only country forecast to report growth in 2020 by the International Monetary Fund, with the country expected to report a 1.9% expansion for the full year.
However, persistently high unemployment and feats of a fresh COVID-19 outbreak has been China’s Achilles’ heel on the road to recovery. Premier Li Keqiang warned earlier in the month that China needs to make arduous efforts to achieve its full-year economic goals.
Meanwhile, the country continues to monitor a new outbreak of cases in the city of Qingdao, with 13 cases reported for Oct. 17."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports fell in September at the slowest pace in seven months as U.S.-bound vehicle shipments rose from lows brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating easing pressure on the world's third-largest economy.
Exports fell 4.9% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, more than the 2.4% economists forecast in a Reuters poll. Still, the pace followed six months of double-digit decline, including a 14.8% drop in August.
Fewer exports of iron to Taiwan and ships to Panama left September marking the 22nd consecutive month of export decline, the longest run since the 23-month stretch through July 1987.
To help the economy through the health crisis, the government should compile a third extra budget for the current fiscal year, economists told Reuters last week. The two earlier budgets helped fund $2.2 trillion in economic stimulus, such as cash payments to households and small business loans.
Indeed, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga plans to order his government to compile another stimulus plan as early as November, to support consumer sentiment at risk from a new wave of COVID-19 infection, local media reported.
Still, the slowing decline in exports adds to other signs of gradual economic recovery such as a pickup in factory output.
""Production has recovered substantially, but as that's mostly a rebound after sharp falls, the recovery pace will probably slow,"" likely after year-end, said chief economist Yuichi Kodama at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
Moreover, a recovery in exports would likely have limited impact on the size of any further stimulus package given the focus will likely be on helping firms suffering from weak domestic demand, Kodama said.
By destination, shipments to the United States rose 0.7%, the first increase in 14 months, driven by stronger demand for electrical power machinery as well as passenger cars, whose numbers jumped 18%.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 14.0%, the sharpest rise since January 2018. Those to Asia as a whole fell 2.0%, their slowest pace of decline since February.
Imports shed 17.2% versus the 21.4% median estimate of economists polled by Reuters, resulting in a trade surplus of 675.0 billion yen ($6.41 billion).
Marcel Thieliant, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said imports of goods and services may return to pre-virus levels until the end of 2022.

""The upshot is that after knocking three percentage points from GDP growth in Q2, net exports will support growth over the coming quarters.""

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected annual industrial output growth to have quickened to 5.8% in September from a 5.6% gain in August, as more businesses resumed production after measures to contain the spread of the virus were lifted.
China's retail sales edged up 3.3% last month from a year earlier, beating analysts' forecast for 1.8% growth compared with 0.5% growth in August.

Fixed asset investment increased 0.8% in the first nine months of the year from the same period in 2019, compared with a forecast 0.8% increase and a 0.3% decline in the first eight months of the year.

The value of Japan’s overseas shipments fell 4.9% from a year earlier in September, narrowing from a 14.8% drop in August, the finance ministry reported Monday, offering an indication that the low point for virus-hit trade has passed. Economists had projected a 2.4% decline.

1330,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 18, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",China’s Rebound Helps to Stabilize a Shattered World Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic recovery from the depths plunged during the Covid-19 pandemic is providing support for a world economy suffering its deepest recession since the Great Depression.
Third quarter data due at 10 a.m. in Beijing Monday is expected to show gross domestic product climbed 5.5% from the same period a year earlier, according to the median of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Retail sales, investment and industrial production are all forecast to pick up in September, suggesting the recovery is broadening.
If the numbers meet expectations, that’ll mean the world’s second-largest economy -- and the first to suffer from the virus shock -- will have regained all the ground it lost in the first half.
Underpinning the recovery has been an aggressive containment of the deadly coronavirus that has allowed factories to quickly reopen and capitalise on a global rush for medical equipment and work-from-home technology -- a dynamic that helped exporters win record market share in the seven months to July.
Shoppers have been more cautious, but robust spending through the recent Golden Week holidays suggest they too are starting to open their wallets again.
The recovery has come with relatively restrained government borrowing and central bank easing compared to China’s peers. Instead, the government has focused on targeted support for business, a contrast to how it responded to the global financial crisis.
“China is supporting the world in a different way from what it did after 2008,” said Shen Jianguang, chief economist of e-commerce giant, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com. “A slowing economy means it could not afford another stimulus in 2020. Instead, it did its job by serving as the ‘supplier of last resort.’”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“The path of industrial production is the most relevant for China’s production-based GDP growth data. Based on production growth in July and August and our projection for September, we estimate GDP growth at 5.3% year on year for 3Q, though recent signs point to some upside to the projection.”

Analysis of International Monetary Fund data shows the proportion of worldwide growth coming from China is expected to increase from 26.8% in 2021 to 27.7% in 2025, according to Bloomberg calculations.
The IMF says Chinese growth is virtually the only reason it expects global output to be 0.6% higher by the end of 2021 compared to the end of 2019.
But the recovery isn’t without its holes. The economy is still forecast to be only 0.7% larger in the nine months through September than it was in the same period in 2019. At the start of the year the government expected full-year growth of around 6%.
And consumers have been slow to spend as they once did. Even with the virus under control, shoppers have spent about 9% less in the first eight months of the year compared to the same period last year.
It’s also unclear how durable the recovery will prove to be given domestic pressures from unemployment and rising corporate and household debt. China Evergrande Group, the world’s most indebted developer, has rattled investors amid fears for its financial health.
Much will also depend on how relations with the U.S. evolve after November’s presidential election. Any worsening of trade frictions could throw a spanner in the export revival. At the same time, the resurgent virus in Europe and the U.S. will complicate the global rebound and could impair China’s own recovery.
Getting the economy quickly back on its feet is crucial to China’s global ambitions. They were hammered home last week by President Xi Jinping during a tour of tech-hub Shenzhen, where he doubled down on calls to take the global lead in technology and other strategic industries.
Urging an “unswerving” commitment to technological innovation in a period of “changes unseen in a century,” Xi again promoted a need to become more self reliant, a policy that is expected to be a central part of a new 5-year economic plan that will be discussed at a Communist Party gathering expected later this month.

That focus on driving growth in new economy sectors like consumption, technology and services means investment there is outstripping that in old sectors, making this cycle different from the credit and construction boom post 2008, noted Cui Li, head of macro research at CCB International Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“An industrial cycle led by the economic upgrade and the absence of a large credit expansion will make this growth recovery more sustainable,” she said. “The Chinese recovery will sustain.”

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",Coronavirus spending pushes U.S. 2020 fiscal year deficit to record $3.132 trillion,"By David Lawder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. budget deficit hit a record $3.132 trillion during fiscal 2020, more than triple the 2019 shortfall due to massive coronavirus rescue spending, the U.S. Treasury said on Friday.
The deficit more than doubled the previous record of $1.416 trillion in fiscal 2009, when the United States was battling a financial crisis.
At the start of the 2020 fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the U.S. government had been forecast to rack up a $1 trillion deficit before coronavirus lockdowns began in March, shutting down large portions of the travel, retail and small business sectors of the economy.
Outlays for fiscal 2020 jumped $2.105 trillion from 2019 to a total of $6.55 trillion, with the increase made up almost entirely from coronavirus aid programs: increased healthcare costs, stimulus checks and unemployment compensation, along with the cost of small business and corporate rescue programs approved by Congress.
As a result of programs that kept paychecks flowing to laid off workers through September, receipts for the full year fell only about 1% or $43 billion from fiscal 2019, totaling $3.42 trillion.
The final fiscal 2020 deficit numbers come as the Trump administration and Congress have been unable to agree on a new round of coronavirus stimulus, with many Senate Republicans calling for fiscal restraint in another package.
A joint statement from the U.S. Treasury and the White House Office of Management and Budget emphasized an ""incredible comeback"" of economic activities as businesses reopened over the summer months.
""The administration remains fully committed to supporting American workers, families, and businesses and to ensuring that our robust economic rebound continues,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.
In September, the year's final month, the U.S. budget deficit was $125 billion, compared with an $83 billion surplus in September 2019, the Treasury said.

September receipts totaled $373 billion, just $1 billion below a year earlier as higher Federal Reserve earnings and excise tax collections made up for lower personal and corporate income tax receipts. September outlays rose by $206 billion from a year earlier to $498 billion, due to COVID-19 related spending.

1332,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales blow expectations in September; dark clouds gathering,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales accelerated in September, rounding out a strong quarter of economic activity, but the recovery from the COVID-19 recession is at a crossroads as government money runs out and companies continue to layoff workers.
New coronavirus cases are also surging across the country, which could lead to restrictions on businesses like restaurants, gyms and bars, and undercut consumer spending. The economy is already shifting into lower gear. Other data on Friday showed an unexpected drop in output at factories last month.
""Although sales growth is strong, it will slow through the rest of this year and into next year,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""The slowing will be even larger if Congress does not pass another stimulus bill. Unemployment remains pervasive throughout the U.S. economy.""
Retail sales jumped 1.9% last month as consumers bought motor vehicles and clothing, dined out and splashed out on hobbies. That followed an unrevised 0.6% increase in August.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would rise 0.7% in September. Some said September's surge was likely exaggerated by difficulties stripping seasonal fluctuations from the data after the shock caused by COVID-19. Unadjusted retail sales fell 2.8% after dropping 1.0% in August.
Retail sales have bounced back above their February level, with the pandemic boosting demand for goods that complement life at home, including furniture and electronics. An aversion to public transportation has boosted motor vehicle purchases. Retail sales rose 5.4% on a year-on-year basis in September. 
They account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the other portion. 
Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, sales increased 1.4% last month after a downwardly revised 0.3% drop in August. 
These so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously estimated to have dipped 0.1% in August.
Economists have attributed the strength in retail sales to fiscal stimulus, especially a weekly subsidy paid to tens of millions of unemployed Americans. September's robust sales reinforced expectations for record consumer spending and economic growth in the third quarter.
Growth estimates for the July-September quarter are as high as a 35.2% annualized rate. That would recoup roughly two-thirds of the output lost because of COVID-19. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947.
U.S. stocks bounced from three straight days of losses on the retail sales data and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s announcement that it could apply for emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate as early as November.
BROAD SALES GAINS 
Last month, sales at auto dealerships surged 3.6%. Receipts at restaurants and bars increased 2.1%. Receipts at clothing stores jumped 11.0%.
""Some of the gain may have reflected increased demand from back to school sales, but with most schools remote learning the reported strength seems dramatic and likely unsustainable,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI), chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.
Even with September's gains, sales at bars, restaurants and clothing stores remain well below their pre-pandemic levels. 
Purchases at electronics and appliance stores fell 1.6%. 
Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.5%. Furniture store sales gained 0.5%. Sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores rebounded 5.7%. These categories notched big year-on-year increases in September, which economists said showed the uneven impact of the recession.
""It's further evidence of how many top earners have managed to dodge the pandemic by working from home, while most lower- paid workers have been forced to choose between jobs putting them at risk, when they can find them, and unemployment,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York.
The White House and Congress are struggling to reach a deal on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed. The government reported on Thursday that new claims for unemployment benefits increased to a two-month high last week.
Last month's jump in retail sales set consumer spending on a higher growth path heading into the fourth quarter, which will likely ensure that the economy continues to expand, though at a moderate pace. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been slashed to as low as a 3% rate from above a 10% pace. 
Some economists believe that historic savings could cushion consumer spending in the absence of more financial aid from the government. Others, however, caution that rising COVID-19 infections and job losses could encourage some consumers to hunker down and conserve savings.
A survey from the University of Michigan on Friday showed consumer sentiment edging up in early October. 
Consumers, however, worried about current economic conditions because of ""slowing employment growth, the resurgence in COVID-19 infections and the absence of additional federal relief payments.""
They were less enthusiastic about buying household appliances. The share who believed it was a good time to buy a car was the lowest in nine years.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Consumer outlooks brightening more among Democrats than Republicans: UMich survey,"By Dan Burns
(Reuters) - Democratic consumers gained ground on their Republican counterparts in their assessment of the economic outlook in early October as the race for the White House that appears increasingly to favor their candidate enters its final stretch.
Overall U.S. consumer sentiment inched up to a seven-month high in early October, led by an uptick in optimism for the future, according to the preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers sentiment index.
But the gain largely came on the back of consumers identifying as Democrats who grew markedly more optimistic, while confidence in the future among those identifying as Republicans increased just negligibly. 
Readings for economic expectations hit their low-water marks for consumers from both parties in May - after two straight months of nationwide business shutdowns to contain COVID-19 tanked the economy. Since then, optimism for the future among Democrats has rebounded sharply, even as their assessment of current conditions has barely improved, an improvement that dovetails with the trajectory of polls showing a widening lead for Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden over the incumbent Republican president, Donald Trump.
In fact, the University of Michigan's expectations index for Democratic consumers has improved by 44% off May's low versus a gain of just 15% among Republican consumers.
Throughout Trump's presidency, Republicans have been more inclined to have a brighter economic outlook than Democrats, just as Democrats tended to have a rosier view throughout the eight years of Barack Obama's term in the Oval Office. But that Republican margin of optimism now stands at its narrowest of Trump's presidency.
Among all households in the survey, 52% now expect a Biden win versus 48% in July, August and September, while those seeing a Trump victory dropped to 45% from 47% over the same period. That represents a net gain of six percentage points for Biden.
Moreover, fewer Republican consumers now expect Trump to win next month than they did in the previous three months, while Democratic consumers have become more confident in a Biden win, the University of Michigan data showed. 
""While self-identified Democrats and Republicans heavily favored the candidate from their own party, that proportion grew by 8 points among Democrats and shrunk by 5 percentage points among Republicans,"" Surveys of Consumers Chief Economist Richard Curtin said. 
Still, he said, all may not be lost for Trump because independents see him winning by a narrow margin.

""Most elections are decided by those who are non-aligned with either party,"" Curtin said. ""The views of Independents remained unchanged and nearly equal, giving Trump a slight advantage of 2 or 3 points.""

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",U.S. business inventories increase for second straight month in August,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories increased for a second straight month in August, suggesting restocking could blunt the hit to economic growth in the third quarter from a widening trade deficit.
Business inventories rose 0.3% in August after edging up 0.1% in July, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Inventories, a key component of gross domestic product, increased in July after six straight monthly declines.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast business stocks rising 0.4% in August.
Retail inventories increased 0.4% in August instead of 0.8% as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 1.2% rebound in July. Motor vehicle inventories rose 0.3% rather than 0.6% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, increased 0.5% instead of 0.9% as estimated last month.
An inventory drawdown contributed to GDP declining at a record 31.4% annualized rate in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted 3.5 percentage points from GDP, the most since the first quarter of 1988. They have been a drag on GDP for five straight quarters. The economy fell into recession in February.
Businesses are rebuilding inventories with imports, which led to the goods trade deficit surging to a record high in August. With most of the imports going to replenish inventories, the wider goods trade deficit will likely make a small dent in GDP growth in the third quarter. Trade contributed to GDP growth in the last three quarters.
Wholesale inventories rose 0.4% in August. Stocks at manufacturers were unchanged.

Business sales increased 0.6% in August after surging 3.4% in July. At August's sales pace, it would take 1.32 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.33 months in July.

The Univeristy of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary index reading for October climbed to 81.2 from a final September level of 80.4. It was the highest level since March and modestly exceeded the median expectation of economists in a Reuters poll of 80.5.
The increase was led by a gain in the expectations index to 78.8, again the highest since March, from 75.6 in September. Economists were looking for a reading of 76.5. The current conditions index, meanwhile, slid to 84.9 from 87.8 and was short of a Reuters estimate of 88.5.

""Slowing employment growth, the resurgence in COVID-19 infections, and the absence of additional federal relief payments prompted consumers to become more concerned about the current economic conditions,"" Surveys of Consumers Chief Economist Richard Curtin said. ""Those concerns were largely offset by continued small gains in economic prospects for the year ahead.""

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Persistently high U.S. weekly jobless claims point to labor market scarring,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose to a two-month high last week, stoking fears the COVID-19 pandemic was inflicting lasting damage to the labor market.
The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed at least 25 million were on jobless benefits at the end of September. It reinforced views the economy's recovery from the recession, which started in February, was slowing and in urgent need of another government rescue package.
The economic hardship wrought by the coronavirus crisis is a major hurdle to President Donald Trump's chances of getting a second term in the White House when Americans go to the polls on Nov. 3. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's candidate, has blamed the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic for the worst economic turmoil in at least 73 years.
""The increase in initial claims is disturbing,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN in New York. ""It is difficult to see it and not think the recovery is vulnerable."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 53,000 to a seasonally adjusted 898,000 for the week ended Oct. 10. Data for the prior week was revised to show 5,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 825,000 applications in the latest week. The surprise increase came even as California processed no claims. California, the most populous state in the nation, suspended the processing of new applications for two weeks in late September to combat fraud. It resumed accepting claims last Monday. 
Graphic: Jobless claims https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/xklpymgympg/joblessclaims.png
Unadjusted claims rose 76,670 to 885,885 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the pandemic. Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.3 million people filed claims last week.
Seven months into the pandemic in the United States, first-time claims remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though below a record 6.867 million in March. With new COVID-19 cases surging across the country and the White House and Congress struggling to agree on another rescue package for businesses and the unemployed, claims are likely to remain elevated.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he would keep trying to reach a deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, before next month's election.
Stocks on Wall Street were lower. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
MILLIONS EXHAUST BENEFITS
About 3.8 million people had permanently lost their jobs in September, with another 2.4 million unemployed for more than six months. Economists fear those numbers could swell. 
Though the claims report showed a decline in the number of people on unemployment rolls in early October, economists said that was because many people had exhausted their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to six months in most states.
The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 1.165 million to 10.018 million in the week ending Oct. 3.
About 2.8 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Sept. 26, up 818,054 from the prior week. That was the largest weekly gain since the program's launch last spring. These benefits are set to expire on Dec. 31. 
Tens of thousands of airline workers have been furloughed. State and local government budgets have been crushed by the pandemic, leading to layoffs that are expected to escalate without help from the federal government. 
""Risks to the labor market outlook are weighted heavily to the downside,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""The increased spread of the virus across much of the country could result in an even larger pullback in business activity than expected.""
Though economic activity rebounded in the third quarter because of fiscal stimulus, the stubbornly high jobless claims suggest momentum ebbed heading into the fourth quarter.
Other reports on Thursday showed mixed fortunes for regional manufacturing in October. A survey from the New York Federal Reserve showed its business conditions index fell seven points to a reading of 10.5 this month. Companies reported continued gains in new orders and shipments, though unfilled orders maintained their decline. Factory employment rose modestly, but the average workweek increased significantly. 
Separately, the Philadelphia Fed said its business conditions index jumped to a reading of 32.3 from 15.0 in September. Measures of new orders and shipments at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware rose. A gauge of factory employment fell, but manufacturers increased hours for workers. 

Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate. The economy contracted at a 31.4% pace in the second quarter, the deepest decline since the government started keeping records in 1947.

The Labor Department said on Thursday import prices increased 0.3% last month. Data for August was revised up to show import prices increasing 1.0% instead of 0.9% as previously reported.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, rising 0.3% in September. In the 12 months through September, import prices fell 1.1% after decreasing 1.4% in August.
Petroleum prices fell 4.2% last month. Excluding petroleum, import prices increased 0.7%. That followed a 0.8% jump in August. The dollar declined 5.6% against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners between April and September. 
The strong rise in ex-petroleum import prices together with a strong increase in producer prices in September suggests that a recent slowdown in consumer inflation was unlikely to translate into falling prices. 
Imported food prices increased 0.8% last month. The cost of goods imported from China were unchanged after edging up 0.1% in August. Prices were flat year-on-year in September.
Last month, prices for imported capital goods ticked up 0.1%. The cost of imported motor vehicles rose 0.2%. Prices for consumer goods excluding autos gained 0.1%.

The report also showed export prices rose 0.6% in September, lifted by gain in nonagricultural and agricultural goods. That followed a 0.5% increase in August. Export prices fell 1.8% on a year-on-year basis in September after declining 2.7% in August.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased to 898,000 last week, its highest since late August, compounding fears that the recovery in the labor market is stalling.
Economists had forecast a decline to 825,000. The prior week's figure was revised up to 845,000 from an initially reported 840,000.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased by over 1 million 10.018 million, a bigger fall than expected. The previous week's figure was revised up by 200,000 to 11.183 million. Continuing claims are falling in part because many people have exhausted their eligibility for regular state benefits.
In the week to September 26, the last for which data are available, just under 800,000 signed off from the regular state rolls, while 818,000 joined the rolls for Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation. the federal program that  provides up to 13 extra weeks of benefits for such people. The overall number of people claiming benefits linked to unemployment fell by some 215,000 to 25.29 million in the last full week of September.

Investing.com – China saw annual factory gate prices fall at a faster-than-predicted pace, while consumer prices rose at their slowest pace in 19 months, highlighting the challenges facing the nation in its economic recovery from COVID-19.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that the consumer price index gained 1.7% year-on-year in September, down on the predicted 1.8% rise and August’s 2.4% growth. The index gained 0.2% month-on-month, against the forecast 0.3% rise and August’s 0.4% gain.
Meanwhile, the producer price index fell 2.1% year-on-year, more than the forecast 1.8% fall and the 2% fall reported in August.
The data also showed that core inflation minus volatile food and energy prices stood at 0.5% year-on-year in September, unchanged from August and gross domestic product grew 3.2% year-on-year in the second quarter.
The data follows Tuesday’s mixed trade data, showing that exports were up 9.9% year-on-year, up from August’s 9.5%, imports were up 13.2% year-on-year, higher than August’s 2.1% slump, and a trade surplus of $37 billion, down from August’s $58.93 billion surplus and missing the $58 billion surplus predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released during the previous week, rose to 54.8 in September.
The world’s second largest economy continues to recover from a grim first quarter which saw country-wide lockdowns to curb the spread of COVID-19, as September saw a faster-than-expected growth in factory activity. However, the rise in consumer prices was the slowest since February 2019.
Producer prices also saw a slowdown which could renew deflation concerns and lead to the government unrolling more aggressive stimulus measures, some investors warn. Producer prices are uses to measure industrial demand, which drives investment and profit.
Premier Li Keqiang also warned on Monday that China needs to make continuous efforts to achieve the country’s full-year economic goals."

The producer price index (PPI) fell for an eighth straight month on an annual basis while consumer prices grew more slowly than expected.
The world's second largest economy has seen a steady recovery after being hard hit by the coronavirus in the first quarter. But a sustained fall in producer prices, seen as a gauge of industrial demand, may rekindle worries about deflation and prompt authorities to provide more support, analysts said.
""The PPI has not rebounded strongly despite the improving trend, pointing to continued weakness in industrial demand. It is unlikely to return to positive territory this year,"" said Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.
""It is possible that the economic recovery in the fourth quarter may not be as strong as it has been in the third quarter.""
The PPI fell 2.1% from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said in a statement. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected the index to decline 1.8% after a 2.0% drop in August. On a monthly basis, PPI rose 0.1%, after increasing by 0.3% in August.
China's gross domestic product grew 3.2% year-on-year in the second quarter, and recent data has pointed to a sustained rebound, underpinned by government stimulus and as the virus comes under control. China releases GDP data for the third quarter on Monday.
But Premier Li Keqiang warned this week that China needs to make arduous efforts to achieve its full-year economic goals, citing a complex domestic and foreign environment. 
China's consumer price index (CPI) rose by 1.7% in September from a year earlier, its slowest increase since February 2019, as pork price inflation moderated further, the NBS data showed.
Economists in a Reuters poll had expected CPI to increase 1.8% after a 2.4% rise in August.
Pork price inflation slowed year-on-year as hog production rebounded and as the government increased sales of frozen pork from state reserves, said Dong Lijuan, senior statistician at the NBS. Pork prices surged this time last year as the African swine fever decimated China's pig herd. 

Pork prices rose 25.5% year-on-year in September, slowing from a 52.6% increase in August. On a monthly basis, they fell 1.6% in September after gaining 1.2% in August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices increased more than expected in September amid a surge in the cost of hotel and motel accommodation, leading to the first year-on-year gain since March.
But the report from the Labor Department on Wednesday, which also showed a jump in the price of iron and steel scrap, did not change the view that overall inflation was cooling amid excess capacity at industries. It, however, confirmed that fears of deflation, which dominated when the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States, were misplaced. 
Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices. Economists expect the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates near zero at least through next year. 
""The prices of some producer prices are climbing, but factories are not back to normal yet,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Fed officials will remain cautious on the inflation outlook until producer price pressures heat up further.""
The producer price index for final demand rose 0.4% last month after advancing 0.3% in August. A 0.4% increase in the cost of services accounted for nearly two-thirds of the gain in the PPI last month. Services increased 0.5% in August. 
In the 12 months through September, the PPI rebounded 0.4% after falling 0.2% in August.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would gain 0.2% in September and rise 0.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.4% in September. The so-called core PPI had increased by 0.3% for three straight months. In the 12 months through September, the core PPI climbed 0.7%. The core PPI gain 0.3% on a year-on-year basis in August.
U.S. stocks were trading largely flat. The dollar (DXY) slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mostly higher.
CONSIDERABLE SLACK
The government reported on Tuesday that consumer prices increased 0.2% in September, with a 6.7% jump in prices for used cars and trucks accounting for most of the gain.
Business closures to slow the spread of the coronavirus caused bottlenecks in the supply chain, pushing up prices of some goods. Though supply chain disruptions have eased, weak demand and slack in the labor market are limiting businesses' ability to raise prices.
The Fed is now more focused on the labor market and has embraced flexible average inflation targeting, which in theory could see policymakers tolerate price increases above the U.S. central bank's 2% target for a period of perhaps several years to offset years in which inflation was lodged below that goal.
The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 1.6% in the 12 months through August. September's core PCE price index data is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.
With new coronavirus infections surging across the United States and the recovery from the downturn, which started in February, showing signs of stress, inflation could remain tepid. At least 25.5 million people are on unemployment benefits.
The third straight monthly increase in services in September was driven by a 3.9% jump in prices for hotel and motel accommodation. There were also increases in the costs of hardware, building materials and supplies. Margins for final demand trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, increased 0.2%. 
Hospital inpatient care rebounded 0.4%, leading to a 0.2% rise in healthcare costs. Portfolio fees shot up 1.4%. Prices for airline tickets rebounded 2.5%. 
Those airline ticket, healthcare and portfolio management costs feed into the core PCE price index. With the relevant CPI and PPI components in hand, economists are predicting the core PCE price index increased by between 1.6% and 1.7% in September.
Some, however, cautioned that used motor vehicles were a wild card. Used cars and truck prices surged in August and September, driving consumer prices in each of the two months. 
Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), noted that there has been ""an unusual relationship between PPI data and PCE data related to used vehicles in recent months.""
Wholesale goods price inflation also picked up last month, boosted by a 14.7% surge in the cost of iron and steel scrap. Prices for goods accelerated 0.4% after edging up 0.1% in August. 
Food prices rebounded 1.2% following three straight monthly declines, but the cost of wholesale gasoline fell 2.8%. 
Excluding food and energy, wholesale goods prices increased 0.4% after climbing 0.3% in August. The fourth straight monthly increase in core goods prices likely reflects a weaker dollar. The greenback has dropped 2.8% against the currencies of the United States' main trade partners since July.

""Goods inflation will remain healthy over the coming months,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in Washington.

(Reuters) - Florida is one of the five best states in the nation in which to do business, according to a new survey. It’s also one of the five worst, according to the same survey, thanks to COVID-19.
Every three years, Development Counsellors International, an economic development marketing firm, surveys executives to rank business climates in the various U.S. states. For the first time since they began doing the survey in 1996, a single state landed in the top five in both categories: Florida. The DCI report was released on Tuesday.
“The rationale for Florida being on both the best and worst lists was entirely due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Julie Curtin, president of DCI’s economic development practice. “In our follow-up questions to corporate executives about the states they selected, the majority of the corporate executives who selected Florida said that the state’s handling of the pandemic had negatively affected their perception of the state’s business climate.”
Because of how the survey is structured, however, other executives were still able to cite Florida as a good place to do business because of things like low taxes and access to skilled workers.
Florida has been a hotspot for the pandemic. So far, 15,552 have died in the state, according to a Reuters tally. Only four other states, New Jersey, New York, California, and Texas, have had more deaths.

The once-every-three-year ranking is usually quite predictable. California has ranked as the worst state to do business in seven of nine surveys. New York took that distinction the other two years. Texas ranks as having the best business climate in this year’s survey, as it did in seven of the last eight surveys.

(Reuters) - U.S. consumers on balance paid only a little bit more for goods and services last month as supply chain disruptions that contributed to a bump up in inflation over the summer began to ease, a welcome respite for the millions who remain unemployed.
While that easing pressure on pinched consumers might offer a benefit to Republican President Donald Trump's reelection prospects against Democratic challenger Joe Biden, it does come with a big ""on the other hand"" caveat: It is the latest sign of fading momentum in the rebound from this spring's record-setting economic slump.
A bit of inflation typically is an indication of strengthening demand, an encouraging signal that consumers have reliable sources of income allowing them to contribute to growing an economy that hinges extensively on their spending. But with roughly 11 million still out of work and desperate for a new round of COVID-19 relief from Washington, September's modest uptick in prices is no such signal.
Here's Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) chief financial economist Aneta Markowska's take: ""After several months of above-trend gains, price pressures are finally normalizing. Both headline and core CPI increased by just 0.2% (month-to-month) in September, with the underlying details painting an even weaker picture.""

In fact, she notes prices would have been unchanged but for one thing: The largest monthly increase in used car and truck prices since 1969. And with cash-strapped consumers increasingly reliant on their own transport to get to an on-site job, that's no welcome development. 
Food price increases, too, are moderating after a big run up in the spring, but where you eat makes a big difference. 
If eating at home, as millions without work have no choice but to do, then food prices were lower for a third straight month.
If eating out, though, as more consumers are doing as restaurants continue to reopen around the country, prices shot up by the most in 12 years last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices increased for a fourth straight month in September, with the cost of cars and trucks rising by the most since 1969, but inflation is slowing amid excess capacity in the economy as it gradually recovers from the COVID-19 recession.
Though the benign report from the Labor Department on Tuesday will have no direct impact on monetary policy, it should allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates near zero for a while and continue with massive cash infusions as it nurses the economy back to health. 
The U.S. central bank is now more concerned about the labor market and has embraced flexible average inflation targeting, which in theory could see policymakers tolerate price increases above its 2% target for a period of perhaps several years to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its goal.
""Price gains are modest as supply chain disruptions have eased and weak demand and excess capacity in many parts of the economy have limited firms' pricing power,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""As long as inflation remains below 2% the Fed will keep providing stimulus to the economy.""
The consumer price index rose 0.2% last month after gaining 0.4% in August. The CPI advanced 0.6% in both June and July after falling in the prior three months as business closures to slow the spread of the coronavirus weighed on demand.
A 6.7% jump in the prices of used cars and trucks again accounted for most of the increase in the CPI last month. That was the biggest gain since February 1969 and followed a 5.4% advance in August. The strong increases likely reflect a shortage of used motor vehicles amid an aversion to public transportation because of fears of contracting COVID-19. 
New motor vehicle prices rose 0.3%. There were also increases in the costs of recreation. But prices for motor vehicle insurance, airline fares and apparel fell.
In the 12 months through September, the CPI increased 1.4% after rising 1.3% in August. Last month's inflation readings were in line with economists' expectations.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI climbed 0.2% after rising 0.4% in August. The so-called core CPI gained 1.7% year-on-year, matching August's increase.

Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
WEAK DEMAND
Inflation is likely to remain muted at least through 2021 amid signs the economy's recovery from the downturn, which started in February, is showing signs of fatigue without more money from the government. At least 25.5 million people are on unemployment benefits. The slack in the labor market has left workers with limited power to bargain for higher wages.
High unemployment makes it harder for landlords to raise rents. The pandemic has also fueled a migration to suburbs and other low-density areas from urban centers, which over time could result in higher vacancy rates for apartments and restrain rent growth. Wages and rents are the biggest inflation drivers.
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, ticked up 0.1% in September after a similar gain in August. That led to an annual gain of 2.5%, the smallest since February 2014.
Gasoline prices edged up 0.1% after rising 2.0% in August. But electricity prices shot up 0.9%, the largest increase since October 2018. 
Food prices were unchanged after nudging up 0.1% in August. The cost of food consumed at home fell 0.4%, declining for a third straight month. Prices for nonalcoholic beverages fell 0.8%, the most since December 2010. Dairy products, meat and fruits and vegetables were also cheaper last month. 
The cost of food away from home rose further, gaining 0.6%. Prices for limited service meals jumped 0.9%, the largest increase since the series started in 1997. Restaurants have raised prices to cover costs related to social-distancing measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. 
The cost of recreation rose 0.2% last month. Apparel prices decreased 0.5% after rising for three consecutive months. The cost of motor vehicle insurance declined 3.5%. Airline fares dropped 2.0% after increasing in each of the last three months. 
Healthcare costs were unchanged after gaining 0.1% in August. Costumers paid more for hospital services, but less for doctors' services and prescription drugs. 
Education prices fell 0.3% after dropping by the same margin in August, which was the first decline since the series started in 1993. Many schools and universities have shifted to online classes because of the pandemic.

The average perceived chance of becoming unemployed over the next year dropped to 16.6% in September from 18% in August but was still well above the pre-pandemic level of 13.8% in February. The drop was driven by an improvement in sentiment among people above age 60 and those with household incomes below $50,000. 
While the U.S. labor market continues to heal from the damage caused by the pandemic, data released by the Labor Department earlier this month shows the recovery is slowing. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 661,000 jobs in September, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May. 
The Fed survey suggested that some consumers think the worst of the pain in the labor market has passed. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher in a year dropped to an average 36.4% in September from 39.1% in August. 
Consumers reported feeling better about their pay and their ability to spend. The median expectation for household income growth increased to 2.3% in September, up 0.1 percentage point from August but still below the 2019 average of 2.8%. Median expectations for household spending growth increased to 3.4% in September, from 3% in August, reaching the highest level since May 2019. 
The survey of consumer expectations is a monthly poll conducted on a rotating panel of 1,300 households.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's imports grew at their fastest pace this year in September, while exports extended strong gains as more trading partners lifted coronavirus restrictions in a further boost to the world's second-biggest economy.
Exports in September rose 9.9% from a year earlier, customs data showed on Tuesday, broadly in line with analysts' expectations and up from a solid 9.5% increase in August.
The strong trade performance suggests Chinese exporters are making a brisk recovery from the pandemic's hit to overseas orders. 
As the global economy restarts, Chinese firms are rushing to grab market share as their rivals grapple with reduced manufacturing capacity.
""The big picture is that outbound shipments remain strong, with easing demand for COVID-19 related goods such as face masks being mostly offset by a recovery in broader demand for Chinese-made consumer goods,"" Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said.
""A jump in imports suggests that domestic investment spending remains strong.""
China's factory activity has also picked up as international trading gradually resumes.
But some analysts warn exports could peak soon as the demand for Chinese-made protective gear recedes and the base effect of this year's massive declines wears off. 
Imports surged 13.2% in September, returning to growth from a fall of 2.1% in August and much stronger than expectations for a 0.3% increase. The import strength was broad based for almost all of China's main trading partners.
Imports from Taiwan surged 35.8% in September from a year ago, while purchases from the United States rose 24.7% on-year. Imports from Australia, however, fell 9.5%.

Wang Jun, chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank, said the data showed government support for the economy has kicked in as the epidemic comes under control.
""This has boosted domestic demand, especially investment-led demand, which buoyed imports,"" Wang said, adding that the yuan's recent appreciation was positive for imports and people's spending power. 
The Chinese yuan  rose to a 17-month high against the dollar on Friday.
The rise in imports pushed the trade surplus for September down to $37 billion, compared with $58.93 billion in August and lower than an expected $58.00 billion.
Across products, China bought more soybeans, grains, semiconductors, copper and steel products in September, customs data showed. Analysts expect imports to stay on an improving trend, underpinned by strengthening domestic demand.
Zhang Jun, chief economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Huaxin Securities, said higher purchases of U.S. agricultural and energy products as China implemented the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal, and the resumption of logistics services in the United States and Europe contributed to China's import strength.
Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal in a telephone call in August.

China's trade surplus with the United States narrowed to $30.75 billion in September from $34.24 billion in August.

Investing.com – Chinese imports saw their fastest growth in 2020, and exports extended strong gains in September as more countries loosened COVID-19 restrictions and world’s second-largest economy continued its economic recovery. However, the country’s trade surplus with the United States narrowed in the same month.
Data released by the National Bureau of Statistics earlier in the day showed that exports were up 9.9% year-on-year, up from August’s 9.5%, and that imports were up 13.2% year-on-year, higher than August’s 2.1% slump.
The trade surplus stood at $37 billion, down from August’s $58.93 billion surplus and missing the $58 billion surplus predicted in forecasts prepared by Investing.com. Exports also missed their predicted 10% growth, while imports more than surpassed the predicted 0.3% growth.
The trade performance data suggested that Chinese exporters are continuing to recover from COVID-19's impact on overseas orders. They are also grabbing the opportunity to increase their market share as the global economy slowly restarts and other countries struggle with reduced manufacturing capacity.
Factory activity also saw an uptick, with data released during the previous week showing that the Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 54.8 in September.
However, exports could soon peak as the demand for Chinese-made protective gear starts to decline, and the base effect of the huge declines seen during the beginning of the year starts to wear off.
U.S.-China tensions are also expected to continue escalating ahead of the U.S. Nov. 3. presidential election. Despite U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirming their commitment to their phase 1 trade deal in an August phone call, China continues to lag on its pledge, made in February, to increase its purchases of U.S. goods. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue also expressed doubt earlier in the month about the probability of China purchasing enough U.S. agricultural products as agreed to in the phase 1 deal, saying that China may fail its commitments due to “non-agricultural trade issues”.
With the number of COVID-19 continuing to rise and China reporting a new cluster of COVID-19 cases in the port city of Qingdao on Monday, the road to recovery could have additional bumps yet."

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>","UK consumers, sensing new COVID restrictions, speed up spending: surveys","LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers ramped up their spending sharply last month as some households stockpiled and began their Christmas shopping early ahead of possible new coronavirus restrictions, according to surveys published on Tuesday.
Credit card provider Barclaycard said spending rose at the fastest rate since the country was hit by the coronavirus lockdown.
Separate data from retailers showed sales values at major store chains jumped by the most in nearly 11 years, excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter. 
Consumer spending has been a rare bright spot for Britain's economy which posted a record drop during the second quarter, although mounting job losses are expected in the coming months.
Barclaycard said its measure of spending rose 2% year-on-year in September, driven by purchases of essentials and representing an acceleration from August's 0.2% increase. Pubs and bars also saw strong spending.
A quarter of consumers polled by Barclaycard said they had stockpiled last month in case of shortages of goods, as they did in the run-up to the coronavirus lockdown in March.
""While the nation's confidence in the UK economy has improved slightly, many are still cautious about the upcoming winter months, and the subsequent uncertainty it may bring has caused some to start stockpiling once more,"" said Raheel Ahmed, head of consumer products at Barclaycard.
A separate survey from the British Retail Consortium also pointed to strong spending.
Retail sales values at major store chains rose 5.6% in annual terms last month, the biggest increase since December 2009 when excluding distortions caused by the changing timing of Easter holidays. 
The BRC said there were signs that consumers had brought forward some of their Christmas shopping.

""The industry is beginning to recover, however, forced store or warehouse closures during any future lockdowns could put paid to this progress,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The pessimism hanging over Japan's manufacturers lifted slightly in October, suggesting businesses were emerging from the coronavirus pandemic's heavy blow to activity and earnings but at a glacial pace.
Some sub-manufacturing sectors, however, believed conditions would stabilise in the next few months, according to the monthly Reuters Tankan, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched tankan quarterly survey.
The result underlines the daunting task Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who rose to power last month, faces in reviving growth and bringing corporate and consumer sentiment back to levels seen before the COVID-19 crisis.
In the poll of 485 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 251 firms responded on condition of anonymity, many complained about the slow pace of recovery from the economic crisis, reporting weakening orders and capital spending.
""The recovery in manufacturing is delayed,"" a manager at a chemicals maker wrote in the survey.
A textile maker wrote: ""Auto sales are stagnating globally, while private consumption within Japan is growing only slowly.""
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers in October rose for the fourth straight month, coming in at minus 26 from minus 29 the previous month. The index has been in negative territory for 15 straight months.
The service-sector index stood at minus 16, up from minus 18 in September, with sentiment among wholesalers, transport and utilities weighing on broad business confidence.
The BOJ's latest ""tankan"" survey released on Oct. 1 showed Japanese business sentiment improved in July-September from a 11-year low hit three months earlier, in a sign economic activity was gradually recovering, though it also remained deeply negative.
The central bank will hold its first policy review since the release of those figures on Oct. 28-29. 
In the Reuters Tankan survey, a manager at a chemicals producer said conditions in the domestic market remained poor, while those in Asian markets were showing signs of a pickup in recovery.
""Private capital spending is stalling,"" a manager at a construction firm wrote in the survey.
Manufacturers saw conditions recover to minus 17 in January, the survey showed, with machinery and transport equipment makers as well as processed food producers expecting conditions to stabilise or move close to stabilisation.

Non-manufacturers especially expected the mood to approach stabilisation, with sentiment seen rising to minus 10 in January.

Industrial output rose 3.3 percent in August from July in Latin America's second largest economy and was 9.0 percent lower year-over-year, the national statistics agency said.
The monthly growth was less than half July's figure, and down from almost 19% in June.
Growth was driven by a recovery in construction, which saw a 11.2% spike in activity compared to July.

Earlier this year, industrial output fell sharply as measures put in place to stem the spread of coronavirus dragged down industries including construction and manufacturing.

Exports have not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared, due in part to record shipments of medical supplies and robust demand for electronic products, adding to hopes for a sustained economic recovery.
In September, exports are expected to have risen 10% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 24 economists. Imports likely rose 0.3% on year, improving after back-to-back decline in July and August.
Exports in August rose a solid 9.5% year-on-year, the strongest gain since March 2019. 
Stronger exports could signal a faster and more balanced recovery for the Chinese economy, which is rebounding from a record first-quarter slump thanks to domestic stimulus measures.
A manufacturing survey showed total new orders in September recorded the strongest increase since January 2011, and a gauge for new export orders--which were hit hard by the global outbreak of the coronavirus--rose at the fastest pace in over three years.
""We expect both export and import growth to accelerate further in September. Global growth has continued to recover and strong global housing activity in recent months should support Chinese exports of furniture and appliances,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a research note last week.
""Import growth may improve in September as well on the back of the solid expansion of domestic activities,"" they said.
However, external demand could suffer if virus control measures are re-imposed by trade partners due to a resurgence in infections.
China is meanwhile looking to reduce its reliance on overseas markets for development as U.S. tensions and the pandemic increase external risks that could hamper long-term progress.
Already heightened U.S.-China hostilities are expected to escalate ahead of the U.S. presidential election next month.
U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue earlier this month warned China may fall short of annual agricultural product purchasing commitments made in its Phase 1 trade deal with the United States.

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 01:05AM ET</span>","Japan September wholesale prices slump, heightening deflation risk","By Leika Kihara
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese wholesale prices fell 0.8% in September from the same month a year earlier, data showed on Monday, marking the seventh straight month of year-on-year declines and heightening the risk the country will slide back into deflation.
Squeezed mostly by soft global demand for commodities and Japanese machinery goods, the weakness in wholesale prices highlights the challenge Tokyo faces in cushioning the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the world's third-largest economy.
The 0.8% fall in the corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures the price companies charge each other for their goods and services, was bigger than a median market forecast for a 0.5% drop. It followed August's 0.6% year-on-year decrease.
Wholesale prices also slid 0.2% in September from August, marking the first on-month drop in four months, the data released by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) showed.
""With the global economy still reeling from the pandemic's pain, the pace of its recovery remains modest. That will weigh on Japan's wholesale inflation,"" a BOJ official told a briefing.
The drop in wholesale prices adds to headaches for the BOJ, which frets that sluggish consumption, particularly for services, will push consumer inflation further away from its 2% target.
Core consumer prices - the BOJ's key inflation measurement - fell 0.4% in August from a year earlier, marking their fastest year-on-year drop in almost four years.
The slew of soft price data may increase the chance the BOJ will cut its inflation forecasts at this month's rate review, when it also conducts a quarterly review of its projections.
Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the pandemic crippled demand. Analysts expect any rebound to remain modest as fears of a second wave of infections weigh on consumption.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories increased 0.4% in August, instead of rising 0.5% as estimated last month. Stocks at wholesalers fell 0.2% in July. The component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product was unchanged in August.
August inventories were down 5.2% from a year earlier.
Gross domestic product declined at a record 31.4% annualized rate in the second quarter, with inventories subtracting 3.5 percentage points, the most in 32 years. GDP is expected to bounce back strongly in the third quarter but growth is seen slowing substantially in the last quarter of this year.
Stocks of motor vehicles and parts rose 4.3% in August.

Sales at wholesalers increased 1.4% in August after rising 4.8% in July. Economists had forecast a 2.0% rise in sales. At August's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.31 months to clear shelves, down from 1.32 months in July.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted a gain of 156,600 jobs and for the unemployment rate to fall to 9.7% from 10.2% in August.
The gain brought employment to within 720,000 of its pre-pandemic level, Statscan said.
""It's a good number. It's very encouraging that we didn't decelerate in September,"" said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.
""Obviously there are some headwinds coming with COVID cases starting to rise again, but it's a very encouraging print nonetheless,"" he added. 
The Canadian dollar strengthened to a 3-week high at 1.3150 to the greenback, or 76.05 U.S. cents.
Full-time employment rose by 334,000 and compared with 44,200 new part-time positions. Employment in the goods-producing sector grew by 75,100 jobs, while the services sector grew by 303,100 positions.

If those who wanted to work but did not look for a job were included as unemployed in September, the adjusted unemployment rate would have been 11.9%, Statscan said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy struggled to grow in August, setting back its recovery from the coronavirus lockdown, and finance minister Rishi Sunak was due to announce more help to slow a rise in jobs losses as a second wave of COVID-19 infections hits.
Gross domestic product rose by 2.1% from July, official data showed, not even half the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and the slowest increase since the economy began to recover in May from a record slump.
Much of what growth there was in August was down to a one-off government restaurant subsidy programme. 
Finance minister Rishi Sunak was due to announce later on Friday a plan to support jobs in businesses that may be ordered to close to slow a resurgence of COVID-19 infections. Economists said the data also raised the chance of more stimulus from the Bank of England.
""The sharp slowdown in growth indicates that the recovery may be running out of steam, with output still well below pre-crisis levels,"" Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce said.
""The increase in activity in August largely reflects a temporary boost from the economy reopening and government stimulus, including the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme, rather than proof of a sustained 'V'-shaped recovery.""
More than half of the economy's growth in August came from accommodation and food, where output surged by 71.4% thanks to the government's one-month meals subsidies, more people taking holidays in Britain and the easing of lockdown restrictions.
JOBS PLAN
Kate Nicholls, head of the UK Hospitality trade body, said new COVID-19 restrictions introduced in September had weighed on the hospitality sector again. 
""Today's figures show our economy has grown for 4 consecutive months, but I know that many people are worried about the coming winter months,"" Sunak said.
""Throughout this crisis, my single-focus has been jobs – protecting as many jobs as possible, and providing support for people to find other opportunities where this isn't possible. This goal remains unchanged.""
Sunak's new jobs plan would subsidise two thirds of the wages of workers in pubs, restaurants and other businesses forced to close to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the Times reported.
His wage subsidy plan for workers across the economy expires at the end of this month and will be replaced by less generous support for employers, raising fears of a jump in job losses.
Friday's data showed the economy - which shrank by more than any other Group of Seven nation in the April-June period - remained 9.2% smaller than its pre-the pandemic level.

The huge services sector grew by 2.4% from July, half the pace expected by economists. Growth in the smaller manufacturing and construction sectors also fell short of forecasts.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said on Thursday that risks to the economy were ""very much on the downside"" and the central bank was ready to use its policy firepower.
Dean Turner, an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said recent surveys had pointed to the economy slowing in September which could be made worse by local COVID-19 restrictions on activity.
""Sluggish progress is likely to encourage the Bank of England to increase its bond buying program at its November meeting,"" he said. 

Britain is also facing the risk that it fails to secure a trade deal with the European Union with negotiations still ongoing ahead of the Dec. 31 expiry of the country's post-Brexit transition period.

Investing.com – China returned from a week-long holiday with a bang, with the services sector remaining positive for a fifth consecutive month in September, helped by continuous recovery from the impact of COVID-19 in domestic supply and demand.
The Caixin Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier in the day, rose to 54.8 in September, against August’s reading of 54. The Composite PMI for September also signaled continued growth, though not at last month's rate, having dropped to 54.5 from the previous month’s 55.1 figure.
Both indexes stayed above the 50-mark indicating growth, but the sector recorded the sharpest rate of expansion in three months, with the rate among the quickest recorded over the past decade.
“The services sector’s post-epidemic recovery showed signs of speeding up … domestic supply and demand in the services sector continued to recover at a faster pace, while overseas demand remained subdued. Both the business activity index and total new business expanded for the fifth straight month, and at a faster pace than the previous month, causing the gauge for outstanding business to break back into expansionary territory,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said.
“Companies remained confident about the economic outlook. In September, the gauge for business expectations rose further into expansionary territory. Companies remained positive about the ongoing economic recovery and the effective control of the epidemic,” he added.
However, employment remains a roadblock on the Chinese path to recovery. The rate of job creation remained marginal overall, despite firms expanding their workforces for the second month in a row in the wake of the sustained economic recovery.

“In the near term, there will still be uncertainties from COVID-19 overseas and the U.S. election, and the development of ‘dual circulation’ in the domestic and international markets will continue to face challenges,” warned Wang.
The services PMI corroborated the official manufacturing and no-manufacturing indices, as well as the previous week's Caixin manufacturing PMI, which remained firmly in the growth zone for the seventh consecutive month.
The manufacturing PMI and the non-manufacturing PMI remained above the 50-mark, with readings of 51.5 and 55.9 respectively. The Caixin manufacturing PMI, released on the same day, fell slightly to 53 in September from August’s 53.1 figure, but remained above the 50-mark."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's household spending fell for an 11th straight month in August and real wages marked half a year of declines, as consumers struggled to return to their pre-pandemic purchasing habits.
Analysts see the economy picking up from the slump caused by the coronavirus but weak spending and wage figures highlight the challenges new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga faces as he works to revive the economy.
Household spending declined 6.9% in August from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, matching a median forecast in a Reuters poll. 
A year-on-year decline in the household spending in August would mark the 11th straight of falls, the longest period of contraction since a 15-month stretch to May 2017.
However, the pace of decline has slowed after hitting a record 16.2% in May, when people stayed at home to prevent the virus infection under the nationwide shutdown.
The government lifted the emergency measures in late May and business activity has gradually resumed.
Compared with the previous month, household spending rose 1.7% in August after a 6.5% decline in July.
""We expect the overall economy including consumer spending will pick up as the economic activity restarts,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""But people remained cautious about risks to get the virus infection and wages are expected to worsen further, so the pace of recovery in consumer spending will likely be limited.""
Separate data on Friday showed the nation's inflation-adjusted real wages fell 1.4% in August from a year earlier, down for the sixth straight month, reflecting a big drop in overtime.

(Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits inched down last week, signaling the U.S. labor market is making little fresh headway in getting millions of people back on the job after being out of work due to COVID-19 disruptions.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 840,000 for the week ended Oct. 3, compared with an upwardly revised 849,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 820,000 applications in the latest week.
While last week's level of new claims was the lowest since March, they have stalled at historically high levels after dropping below 1 million in August as the government changed the way it strips seasonal fluctuations from the data. They are above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though filings have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March.
The data on new claims for the past two weeks has been distorted by California taking a two-week hiatus in reporting its numbers because of problems with a backlog of filings and indications of fraud. 
""With California pausing initial claims for two weeks, the change in initial claims ... is a hollow metric,"" AnnElizabeth Konkel, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, said in note. ""Headline number aside, the report points to a wounded economy that’s not in good shape for winter."" 
The number of people continuing to draw benefits after their initial claim for assistance fell to 10.976 million in the week ended Sept. 26 from 11.979 million the week before. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast continuing claims at 11.4 million.
A wider measure of those drawing assistance under measures enacted by Congress earlier this year showed 25.5 million people receiving benefits in the week ended Sept. 19, a decrease of about 1 million.
On Wall Street, stocks were higher for a second day as investors clung to the hope that the elevated claims data might be a catalyst for a new round of federal pandemic relief. The S&P 500 (SPX) was up 0.5% at a one-month high.
Labor market gains from the reopening of businesses are fading. Last Friday's employment report for September - the last one before the Nov. 3 presidential election - showed the fewest number of jobs created since the labor market began recovering in May. Roughly half of the 22.2 million people who lost their jobs in the early days of the pandemic remain out of work.
Economists are predicting a further slowdown in hiring through the rest of 2020 and into 2021, especially without another federal pandemic assistance package. 
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said talks with Congress had restarted on targeted fiscal relief. Earlier this week, Trump cut off negotiations with Democrats on new aid, shortly after being released from Walter Reed Medical Center, where he had been treated for COVID-19.
Meanwhile, progress containing the coronavirus remains elusive, with cases rising across much of the country and a surge expected in the fall, which could lead to the reimposition of restrictions on businesses in the hard-hit services sector. 

""Putting a damper on forecasts for broad, near-term economic improvement are the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the dim prospects for further substantial federal relief legislation,"" Bankrate.com Senior Economic Analyst Mark Hamrick said in a note. ""Many Americans are still facing the prospect of layoffs, and businesses of all sizes are facing the threat of failure, reduced sales and or capacity.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's service sector sentiment rose in September to the highest level in 2-1/2 years, government data showed on Thursday, suggesting that the economy is gradually recovering from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
A survey of workers such as taxi drivers, hotel workers and restaurant staff - called ""economy watchers"" for their proximity to consumer and retail trends - showed their confidence about current economic conditions grew 5.4 points from August to 49.3 in September.
It was the highest level since April 2018 and the fifth straight month of increase, boding well for the government's efforts to prevent a pandemic-driven recession from deepening.
""While conditions remain severe due to the pandemic's fallout, sentiment is improving,"" the government said on the survey. ""While there are concerns over the pandemic, sentiment is likely to continue recovering,"" it said.
A separate private survey showed the flood of money pumped out by the government and central bank is keeping companies afloat for now, despite the hit to sales from the pandemic.
The number of corporate bankruptcies totalled 3,956 cases in the first half of the fiscal year that began in April, down 5.2% from the same period last year and the lowest level in nearly 16 years, private think-tank Teikoku Databank said on Thursday.
Total liabilities for firms that went under stood at 601.25 billion yen ($5.67 billion), the second-lowest level on record, the report from Teikoku Databank showed.
The Bank of Japan has ramped up stimulus twice so far this year and created a lending facility to channel funds via banks to cash-strapped smaller firms.
The government also deployed two massive spending packages, and offered cheap loans backed by state-affiliated lenders to help companies weather the hit from the health crisis.

Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the pandemic crippled demand. Analysts expect any rebound to remain modest as fears of a second wave of infections weighed on consumption.

Employers hired permanent staff at the fastest rate in nearly two years and temporary hiring also grew, the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and accountants KPMG said.
""While it's encouraging to see a further recovery in hiring activity ..., it's concerning to see another rapid rise in total candidate availability,"" said James Stewart, vice chair at KPMG.
The number of coronavirus cases is rising quickly in Britain, as it is in other countries. 
A government support programme that paid up to 80% of the wages of temporarily laid-off employees ends this month and will be replaced by a less generous scheme that will require companies to shoulder much more of the bill.
""With increasing unease over what will happen in the coming months with the pandemic, Brexit and with the end of the furlough scheme in sight, the uncertainty for UK business is not going to dissipate anytime soon,"" Stewart said.

Around 700,000 people on payrolls have lost their job since the start of the pandemic, according to tax data, and most economists think worse is to come.

1378,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Fed Members Continue to Back Stimulus Amid Risks to Outlook: Minutes,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com - Federal Reserve policymakers agreed that current monetary policy measures were appropriate to support the economic recovery as the risks to the outlook remained tilted to the downside,  the minutes of the Fed's September meeting showed on Wednesday.
""Fiscal policy measures, along with the support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve's liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to continue supporting the second-half recovery, al­though the recovery was forecast to be far from complete by year-end. The staff's forecast assumed the enactment of some additional fiscal policy support this year; without that additional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower.""
At its previous meeting, the Fed held interest rates steady in the range of 0% to 0.25% and signaled no hikes through 2023.
The minutes of the meeting showed there was a consensus among members to keep policy accommodative until the economy has achieved maximum employment and inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2% for some time. The minutes noted, however, that inflation is not expected to meet the central bank's target any time soon.  ""With the more-accommodative monetary policy assumed in the current forecast, which reflected the recent consensus statement, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023.""
The minutes come a day after hopes that U.S. lawmakers will roll out broad-based stimulus sooner rather than later were dealt a blow.  President Donald Trump on Tuesday rejected U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's $2.4 trillion stimulus proposal, though vowed to pass a ""major"" stimulus should he emerge victorious in the upcoming election.  Trump, however, said he was ready to sign separate stimulus packages. 
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday warned Congress over the economic fallout of delivering a stimulus package that was too small.
""Too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardship for households and businesses,"" Powell said in a speech at a virtual annual meeting held by the National Association for Business Economics. ""Over time, household insolvencies and business bankruptcies would rise, harming the productive capacity of the economy, and holding back wage growth.""
The Fed's September meeting also marked the central bank's adoption of its new inflation measure allowing prices to overshoot its 2% target for a period of time. Fed members supported the shift outcome-based guidance, though some raised concerns the enhanced forward guidance could limit the central bank's flexibility and pressure yields.
""Several participants noted that while they agreed it was appropriate to incorporate key elements of the consensus statement into the postmeeting statement, they preferred to retain forward guidance similar to that provided in recent FOMC statements. These participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of policy for some time in order to foster outcomes consistent with the Committee's revised consensus statement,"" the minutes noted.
But with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did ""not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields."" These participants were concerned that forward guidance that involved the target range for the federal funds rate remaining at the effective lower bound until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the Committee's flexibility for years,"""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government upgraded its assessment of the economy on Wednesday for the first time since May 2019 after a key indicator improved for August, pointing to a gradual recovery from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The index of coincident economic indicators, which measures a range of data including factory output, employment and retail sales numbers, rose a preliminary 1.1 points from the previous month to 79.4 in August, the Cabinet Office said on Wednesday. 
Based on the index data, the Cabinet Office said that showed economic activity in the world's third-largest economy had stopped contracting, an upgrade from its previous view that the economy was ""worsening"" in July.
""There is a possibility that the index will grow further this year as there is room for exports, notably auto shipments, and consumer spending to recover,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""The economy overall has been picking up after hitting the bottom around May and a gradual recovery is expected to continue.""
The data offers some relief for new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who has pledged to contain the coronavirus outbreak and revive Japan's battered economy.
The report follows the release last month of more upbeat economic outlook from the Bank of Japan, suggesting that no immediate expansion of stimulus was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
Also on Wednesday, the Cabinet Office reported the index of leading economic indicators, which is a gauge of the economy a few months ahead and is compiled using data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, grew 2.1 points to 88.8 from July.
Still, analysts expect the pace of recovery may not be strong enough to recoup losses caused by the coronavirus outbreak, underscoring the challenge for policymakers to revive the economy.

Japan's economy sank deeper into its worst post-war contraction in the second quarter, reeling from the impact of the coronavirus.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Orders for German-made goods rose 4.5% in August, more than expected, boosting hopes for a robust third-quarter in Europe's largest economy after the coronavirus shock.
The increases were driven by demand from the euro zone, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday, suggesting companies are making good progress back to pre-crisis levels. A Reuters forecast had predicted a 2.6% gain on the previous month. 
""The catch-up process for new industry orders is continuing at a remarkable pace,"" the economy ministry said in a statement.
Order intake was now only 3.6% lower than in February, before lockdown measures were imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the office said.
Economists applauded the strong data, but cautioned that rising infection rates across Europe were increasing the risk of setbacks.
""It is difficult to imagine how German manufacturing could escape another round of lockdown measures with important trading partners,"" said ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski.
""Nevertheless, today's industrial order data suggest that full order books - at least in the near future - could help the manufacturing sector to overtake the service sector.""
Official figures released last week showed German retail sales rose much more than expected in August and unemployment fell further in September, boosting hopes that household spending would power a recovery.
Figures from the statistics office showed that orders from abroad increased by 6.5%, boosted by a 14.6% surge in orders from the rest of the euro zone. Domestic orders rose by 1.7% on the month.
The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic.
An easing of lockdown measures, coupled with an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus packages, has led to a robust recovery in the third quarter, but a spike in new COVID-19 cases has caused concern that activity could slow again.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier warned on Monday that Germany must avoid another shutdown of industrial activity.[L8N2GW4C8] 

The Ifo institute expects 6.6% output growth in the third quarter, then a slowing to 2.8% in the fourth quarter.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its non-manufacturing activity index rose to a reading of 57.8 last month from 56.9 in August. That put the index just above its 57.3 level in February. 
A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index slipping to 56.0 in September.
The improvement in services industry activity fits in with expectations for a record rebound in economic growth in the third quarter after a historic plunge in gross domestic product in the April-June period. The economy got a boost over the summer from fiscal stimulus. 
Growth has, however, shifted into low gear as businesses exhaust government loans to help them with expenses like wages and funding for a weekly unemployment subsidy for millions runs out. New coronavirus cases are rising, with a surge expected in the fall, which could lead to some restrictions being imposed on businesses in the services sector.
The ISM reported last week that factory activity slowed in September as new orders retreated from a more than 16-1/2-year high. The government reported on Friday the economy added 661,000 jobs in September, the fewest since the jobs recovery started in May, after creating 1.489 million in August. 

The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry increased to a reading of 61.5 in September after dropping to 56.8 in August. But backlog orders and exports orders fell last month. The survey's index of services industry employment rebounded to 51.8 from a reading of 47.9 in August.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic recovery faltered in September with growing evidence sectors and countries in the bloc are diverging as a resurgence of the coronavirus forces the reimposition of restrictions on activity.
A rise in infection rates in Europe, which a Reuters poll concluded last month was the biggest threat to the economic recovery, will concern policymakers who had hoped the euro zone economy was healing after contracting an historic 11.8% in the second quarter. [ECILT/EU]
Monday's purchasing managers' surveys showed services activity, which accounts for around two-thirds of the bloc's GDP, slammed into reverse after sister surveys last week suggested factories was enjoying something of a revival.
There was also a split between the currency union's member countries. While Germany's service industry barely grew in September, strong manufacturing helped the private sector in Europe's largest economy remain on track for a solid recovery.
But French business activity fell for the first time since June and in Spain the services sector sank deeper into the red as travel restrictions ravaged the summer tourism season.
Italy's services industry contracted for the second month running with no sign of recovery on the horizon.
""The recovery in industry had been lagging but does seem now to have been catching up whereas services really is bearing the brunt of tighter restrictions,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
""In Spain and France in particular, and elsewhere in the euro zone, there has been a tightening up. Fears of a resurgence are adding to consumer caution,"" Hinds said.
Meanwhile, Britain's economy, outside the currency union, proved more resilient than initially thought last month, despite a tightening of lockdown restrictions and an end to a temporary government subsidy for businesses such as restaurants and bars.
EXTRA SUPPORT
Euro zone retail sales were much stronger than expected in August due to a sharp surge of online purchases and increased clothing sales amid the pandemic, although July sales were revised downwards, official data showed on Monday.
""These sales numbers are almost too good to be true, with worries about unemployment rising and consumer confidence at historically low levels,"" said Bert Colijn at ING. 
""Current levels of spending cannot be maintained for more than a few months at best, and are likely to be reversed sooner.""
To support the bloc's economy, the European Central Bank plans to make 1.35 trillion euros of additional pandemic-related asset purchases and the European Union has announced a 750 billion euro recovery fund due to kick in next year.
But that didn't stop IHS Markit's final composite Purchasing Managers' Index, combining services and manufacturing surveys and seen as a good barometer of overall economic health, falling to 50.4 in September from August's 51.9, close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
Suggesting any pick up may take some time, however, demand for services fell in September and firms cut headcount for a seventh month. 

Still, optimism about the coming year improved to levels not seen since before Europe felt the full brunt of the pandemic. The composite future output index rose to its highest level since February.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy proved more resilient than initially thought last month, despite a tightening of lockdown restrictions and an end to a temporary government subsidy for businesses such as restaurants and bars, a major survey showed on Monday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the services sector - which does not cover retailers - dropped to 56.1 in September from August's five-year high of 58.8, but the decline was smaller than an initial ""flash"" estimate of 55.1.
Readings above 50 indicate that a majority of businesses reported growth in activity.
The composite PMI, which includes manufacturing data released last week, fell to 56.5 from August's six-year high of 59.1, again a smaller drop than first reported.
""The UK service sector showed encouraging resilience in September, with business activity continuing to grow solidly despite the government's 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme being withdrawn,"" IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson said.
""Many other consumer services activities showed a similar slide back into contraction as renewed lockdown measures were introduced,"" he added.
The PMI data painted a more upbeat picture than most other business surveys. 
The British Chambers of Commerce said on Thursday that many more firms reported falls in sales during the third quarter than saw an increase, and said its data did not point to a sharp, 'V'-shaped recovery. [nL8N2GS5KG]
Britain's economy shrank by a record 20% in the second quarter when lockdown measures were tightest, and performed worse than any other major advanced economy in the first half of the year. [nL8N2GR3AE]
However there has been a fairly rapid - though uneven - recovery and economists polled by Reuters forecast on average that August gross domestic product data, due on Friday, will show output was around 7% below its year-ago level.
Last week the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, said he expected output in September to be just 3-4% below year-ago levels, and said many commentators had underestimated the strength of the rebound. [nL8N2GR2P3]
Nonetheless, a sharp rise in COVID cases in Britain in September - following similar surges in France and Spain - has led to new restrictions on socialising at home or outside, though schools and workplaces remain open.
IHS Markit said confidence about the future remained positive, but was its weakest since May in both the services and the composite data.

Businesses also cut jobs for a seventh month in a row in September - the longest run since 2010. The reductions, though, were at the slowest pace since March despite the imminent end of a government job support programme this month.

The index dropped below the 50-point threshold dividing an expansion in activity from a contraction for the first time since June, after France emerged from a nearly two-month coronavirus lockdown the previous month.
IHS Markit's PMI index for the services sector also fell into contraction territory at 47.5. 
Already published data for the manufacturing sector, much less client-facing than services, showed that activity picked up slightly there.

IHS Markit's final services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.6 from 52.5 in the previous month.
The reading, which came in higher than a flash reading of 49.1, marked the third month in a row that the services index was above the 50 mark dividing growth from contraction.
The final composite PMI covering both the services and manufacturing sectors rose to 54.7 from 54.4 the previous month. That was higher than the flash figure of 53.7.
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said coronavirus infections in Germany had been rising to a smaller extent than in other European countries, so the impact on actual services activity had been smaller than in the likes of Spain and France.
""While the service sector is close to stalling, growth in Germany has been buoyed by a reviving manufacturing sector, which means the economy carries at least some momentum heading into the final quarter of the year,"" Smith said.
Germany is doing also better than most of its euro zone peers in terms of shielding the labour market from the brunt of the pandemic as there was some hiring across the service sector and a slowdown in factory job cuts, he added.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz have since March unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help companies and consumers recover as quickly as possible from Germany's deepest recession on record.
The packages include unlimited liquidity aid for struggling companies, a massive job protection scheme to shield workers from sudden unemployment as well as cash handouts for parents and a temporary value added tax cut to boost domestic demand.
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic.

The indicator had briefly surpassed 50 in June and July when the country emerged from a three-month lockdown. But new outbreaks of the coronavirus and travel restrictions imposed by various European countries have ravaged the summer tourism season.

The headline index, while still below the 50 neutral level, was higher than a preliminary reading of 45.6, suggesting conditions were moving closer to stabilisation.
""Overall, there are signs of improvement in the sector, however recovery is far from secure,"" said Shreeya Patel, economist at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Demand across the country remains subdued, with tourism and travel restrictions impeding new work volumes across the service sector.""
The main reading was pulled down by an accelerated decline in new orders from abroad, with surveyed firms citing depressed demand conditions in export markets as well as the closure of clients' businesses.
However, the survey also showed strong optimism in companies' outlook for the 12 months ahead on hopes of a recovery in demand, pushing the business expectations sub-index to its highest level of the year.
While job shedding continued for a seventh month, the pace of staff cuts was more modest and neared a neutral level.
The results echo a key Bank of Japan survey from last week that showed business sentiment improved in the third quarter from a 11-year low hit three months earlier, in a sign of a gradual economic turnaround.

The index has come a long way since hitting a trough of -34 in April at the height of the pandemic though it is still nowhere close to the long-run average of +6.
The survey's measure of business confidence picked up too, but stayed in negative territory, climbing to -4 from -8 in August.
The improvement in conditions was driven by a rise in all three sub-components with trading and profitability in positive territory, likely reflecting improving activity as the economy opens up.
The employment index stayed negative, suggesting businesses were not yet ready to add new positions.
Forward orders rose to -7 while capacity utilisation edged up to 76.9%. This, in addition to still negative confidence, has seen capex stay in negative territory, NAB noted.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",U.S. job growth slows; nearly four million Americans permanently unemployed,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth slowed more than expected in September and over 300,000 Americans lost their jobs permanently, dealing a potential blow to President Donald Trump ahead of the fiercely contested Nov. 3 presidential election. 
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday underscored an urgent need for additional fiscal stimulus to aid the economy's recovery from a recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. The slowdown in hiring compounds problems for Trump, who announced overnight that he had tested positive for coronavirus.
Just over half of the 22.2 million jobs lost during the pandemic have been recouped. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party nominee, blames the economic turmoil on the White House's handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 people and infected over 7 million in the nation.
""The jobs report adds to Trump's woes,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""Betting odds signal a diminished chance he will win re-election and a much higher probability of a Democrat clean sweep.""
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 661,000 jobs last month, the smallest gain since the jobs recovery started in May, after advancing 1.489 million in August. Every sector added jobs with the exception of government, which shed 216,000 positions because of the departure of temporary workers hired for the Census and layoffs at state and local government education departments as many school districts shift to online learning.
Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 318,000, accounting for nearly half of the gain in nonfarm employment. Payrolls are 10.7 million below their pre-pandemic level. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 850,000 jobs were created in September. Employment growth peaked in June when payrolls jumped by a record 4.781 million jobs.
(Graphic: Nonfarm payrolls - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvoaeqevd/nfpr.png)
The unemployment rate fell to 7.9% in September as 695,000 people left the labor force from 8.4% in August. The jobless rate was again biased down by people misclassifying themselves as being ""employed but absent from work."" 
Without this error, the government estimated that the unemployment rate would have been about 8.3% in September. There were 3.8 million people who had lost their jobs for good, up 345,000 from August. More experienced long bouts of unemployment, with the number of people out of work for more than 27 weeks surging 781,000 to 2.4 million. 
The slowing labor market recovery is the strongest sign yet that the economy has shifted into lower gear heading into the fourth quarter. Growth got a boost over the summer from fiscal stimulus. Third-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates are topping a 32% annualized rate, which would reverse a historic 31.4% pace of contraction in the April-June quarter. 
Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to around a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.
""The virus is in the driver's seat in controlling the speed of the recovery and right now the economy is in the slow lane unless Congress and the White House can settle their differences and provide additional stimulus,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street fell. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were lower.
WOMEN LEAVING LABOR FORCE
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday approved a $2.2 trillion rescue package. Objections from top Republicans are likely to doom the plan in the Senate.
New coronavirus cases are rising, with a surge expected in the fall, which could lead to some restrictions being imposed on businesses in the services sector. Trump's positive coronavirus test added to political uncertainty that could extend beyond the election, and make businesses cautious about hiring.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. said this week it would lay off roughly 28,000 employees in its theme parks division. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines, two of the largest U.S. carriers, said they were beginning furloughs of more than 32,000 workers on Thursday, absent government assistance.
With many enduring long spells of joblessness, economists believe the unemployment rate will not see its pre-crisis level of 3.5% until mid-2024 and it could take a year to regain the lost jobs. This could further widen the income inequality gap.
The COVID-19 crisis has disproportionately affected the lower-income population and women, who have dropped out of the labor force to look after children. 
(Graphic: Labor market participation - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwjzqrvw/lmparticipation.png)
The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 61.4% from 61.7% in August. The participation rate for women dropped to 55.6% from 56.1%. It was little changed for men.
""It may very well be the case that more home schooling is putting incremental downward pressure on the labor force participation rate, which fell meaningfully more in September for women,"" said Robert Rosener, an economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in New York.
Though people worked more hours, a proxy for take-home wages declined on a year-on-year basis for a sixth straight month.

""This along with reduced fiscal support will temper consumer spending in the coming months,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that factory orders rose 0.7% after accelerating 6.5% in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders would increase 1.0% in August.
Manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of U.S. economic activity, is recovering from its pandemic lows as businesses replenish inventories. The pace of expansion, however, is slowing as the coronavirus crisis lingers and the boost from fiscal stimulus ebbs.
The Institute for Supply Management reported on Thursday that its measure of national factory activity fell in September as new orders retreated from more than a 16-1/2-year high.
Unfilled orders at factories dropped 0.6% in August after falling 0.7% in July. Inventories at factories were unchanged, while shipments of manufactured goods rose 0.3%.
The government also reported that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business spending plans on equipment, rose 1.9% in August instead of increasing 1.8% as reported last month.
Shipments of core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the GDP report, increased 1.5% as previously reported.

Business investment tumbled at a record 26% annualized rate in the second quarter, with spending on equipment collapsing at an all-time pace of 35.9%. Investment in equipment has contracted for five straight quarters.

Investing.com -- The U.S. labor market's recovery weakened in September, with the economy adding only 661,000 new nonfarm jobs through the middle of the month, less than half of what it created in the month through mid-August.
The number was well below expectations for net gains of 850,000. However, August's numbers were revised up by 118,000 to 1.47 million.
Kit Juckes, a macro strategist for Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), said via Twtter that the data ""suggest (the) jobs recovery is ongoing but slowing a bit.""
The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 7.9% of the workforce, from 8.4% in August. Analysts had expected a rate of 8.2% ahead of time. The broader 'U6' measure of underemployment also fell, but stayed at the historically high level of 12.8% of the labor force. Participation in the workforce fell again, to 61.4% from 61.7% in August.
The shortfall in job gains was accounted for entirely by government employment, which fell by 216,000 in the month. Private payrolls expanded by 877,000, even more than expected after ADP flagged a gain of just under 750,000 earlier in the week. 
Financial markets were nonetheless disappointed by the news, which followed only hours after President Donald Trump's positive test for the Covid-19 virus for once upstaged what is normally the world's most important economic data release of the month. By 8:55 AM ET (1455 GMT), Dow Jones Futures were down 1.6% after being down only 1.2% immediately before the release, while S&P 500 Futures were down 1.7%.
The last two months' data have been distorted to a degree by hiring for the 2020 census. On a slightly longer view, it now appears that the economy has clawed back just over half of the jobs that it lost in first wave of the pandemic in spring. 
However, the pace of improvement has slowed markedly from nearly 4.8 million new jobs in June to less than one-fifth of that in September. In addition, there are increasing signs of companies finally resorting to layoffs as the level of government support for the economy ebbs in the absence of a new fiscal support package. Walt Disney  (NYSE:DIS), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and  American Airlines Group  (NASDAQ:AAL) between them confirmed some 60,000 job cuts this week alone, while insurer Allstate  (NYSE:ALL) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also announced they would shed positions.
""Today's jobs report will not change perceptions that (the) U.S. labor market is stressed,"" wrote Marc Chandler, managing director of Bannockburn Global Forex. ""Yesterday, we learned 837,000 people filed initial unemployment benefit and another 650,000 sought emergency assistance.""

1396,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>","Euro zone inflation at a four-year low, raising pressure on ECB","BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation fell deeper into negative territory last month, raising pressure on the European Central Bank to add stimulus, as an ongoing recession will keep price growth below its target for years to come. 
Annual inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to minus 0.3% in September, its lowest in more than four years, from minus 0.2% a month earlier. That fell short of expectations for an unchanged reading, data from Eurostat showed on Friday.
More worryingly for ECB policymakers, underlying inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, fell to 0.4% from 0.6%, far from the ECB's target of almost 2%. Services inflation slowed further and the cost of imported industrial goods fell.
Although the ECB has unleashed unprecedented stimulus this year to combat a pandemic-induced economic shock, rising unemployment, surging savings, widespread restrictions on travel and plummeting business investment have proved an exceptional drag on prices.
A second wave of the coronavirus is likely to add to the gloom, which torpedoes confidence and weighs on prices further, economists say.
While the ECB held fire last month, it kept the door wide open to more stimulus. Board member Fabio Panetta made a clear case for preemptive action, arguing that the cost of doing too much is smaller than the cost of inaction.
His argument is further supported by a tumble in an even narrower core inflation reading, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, to 0.2% from 0.4%.
Still, no ECB move is likely in October. Policymakers have long said that more data, particularly on 2021 fiscal policies, will be needed before they can take a fresh decision.
They have also prepared markets for bad inflation readings, arguing that price growth could stay negative for the rest of the year before a steady acceleration next year.
But more stimulus is increasingly likely in December. The ECB is expected then to extend and expand its 1.35 trillion-euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, used to soak up government and corporate debt to keep borrowing costs down.
The ECB could also improve the terms of its super cheap loans to commercial banks so they will keep lending to the real economy.

Some 83,529 people left the ERTE furlough scheme in September, leaving 728,909 workers still enrolled, the data showed. That is 76% lower than the April peak, when more than 3 million people were supported by the programme.
Some 84,013 net jobs were added in September, an increase of 0.45% from August and the fifth consecutive month of job creation.
Over the same period, the number of people registering as jobless fell by 0.69%, or 26,329 people, leaving 3.8 million people out of work, according to the Labour Ministry.
Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz said it was the largest drop in jobless numbers recorded in September since 1996.
""These data show a positive trend in a still uncertain pandemic scenario,"" she tweeted. 
Unemployment had risen by 0.79% in August as new outbreaks of the coronavirus and travel restrictions imposed by other countries began taking a toll after months of timid recovery from an initial lockdown.

However, around 450,000 jobs were destroyed compared to September 2019.

Analysts say the economy is rebounding gradually after suffering its worst post-war contraction in the second quarter, but the jobs and wage situation remain weak. 
New COVID-19 cases in Japan have been on a general downward trend recently but appear to be levelling off.
Household spending likely fell 6.9 % in August from a year earlier, the poll of 14 economists showed, after a 7.6 % fall in July. 
Compared with the previous month, household spending is forecast to have risen 3.2% in August from a 6.5% decline, the poll found.
""As the coronavirus cases resurged in Japan, people's self-restraint stance towards spending on entertainment and tourism persisted,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Wage pressures such as lower summer bonuses are expected to result in lacklustre consumer spending for some time, he added.
The government will announce household spending data at 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 9 (2330 GMT, Oct. 8).
The government is continuing to urge restaurants and shops to take measures to prevent infections, such as giving enough distancing and good ventilation to customers. 
Other data next week is expected to show the current account balance was in a surplus of 1.98 trillion yen ($18.74 billion) in August, up from 1.47 trillion yen in July, partly helped by a pickup in exports on the back of the global economic recovery, analysts said.

The finance ministry will release the current account balance on Thursday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's unemployment rate rose in August to its highest in over three years and job availability fell to a more than six-year low, government data showed on Friday, indicating damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic persisted through the month.
The figures come after new prime minister Yoshihide Suga pledged to protect jobs, keep companies in business and help the economy recover from the impact of measures taken to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
They also dull any optimism brought by recent data such as factory output and business sentiment which offered signs of economic recovery.
""The government's special employment subsidy to support firms hit by the coronavirus has helped to rein in the jobless rate, which could have risen much higher,"" said Atsushi Takeda, chief economist at Itochu Research Institute.
""People have started to seek jobs but the labour market is not strong enough to absorb them. The pace of recovery in the jobs market is likely to slow and the unemployment rate could rise further.""
Japan's seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 3.0% in August, the highest since May 2017, labour ministry data showed. The result met analysts' median forecast of 3.0%.
The data showed about 2.06 million people lost their jobs in August, 490,000 more than in the same month a year earlier, and marking the seventh consecutive month of increase.
Compared with the previous month, however, the number of employed workers rose by 110,000 people in seasonally adjusted terms - the fourth straight month of gain.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 1.04, matching a level last seen in January 2014. It compared with 1.08 in July, and a median forecast of 1.05.
Worsening conditions in the jobs market is likely to add pressure to the government to offer further support for small and mid-sized firms to help prevent further job losses.

The economy logged its worst post-war contraction in the second quarter of the year as the coronavirus outbreak jolted both external and domestic demand.

""Economic conditions remained exceptionally weak in the third quarter,"" BCC economist Suren Thiru said.
The BCC's quarterly economic survey - the largest of its kind in Britain - showed that 46% of firms surveyed reported that sales had fallen over the quarter, compared with 73% who reported a decline in the second quarter.
Just 27% of the 6,410 businesses surveyed between Aug. 24 and Sept. 14 reported higher sales than three months earlier.
The hospitality and catering sectors - which still face significant COVID restrictions on the size of events - were the most likely to report a further fall in sales. 
""While the declines in indicators of activity slowed as the UK economy gradually reopened, they remain well short of pre-pandemic levels with little sign of a swift 'V'-shaped recovery,"" Thiru said.
Britain's economy shrank by an historic 20% in the second quarter of 2020 after output collapsed in April, and the most recent official data show output in July was 11% below last year's level.
Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane estimated on Wednesday that output at the end of September was just 3%-4% below pre-crisis levels, and said those who took a less upbeat view risked undermining the recovery.
Some 41% of businesses in the BCC survey expected sales to improve over the next 12 months, compared with 35% who expected a decline.
However the BCC said rising coronavirus cases and more widespread local lockdowns since the survey concluded raised the danger that recent gains would go into reverse.

""Economic scarring already caused by the pandemic (is) starting to crystallise,"" Thiru said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week but remained at recession levels, while personal income dropped in August, underscoring the need for another government rescue package for businesses and the unemployed.
The decline in initial claims reported by the Labor Department on Thursday likely reflected a decision by California, the most populous state in the nation, to suspend the processing of new applications for two weeks to combat fraud. Factory activity slowed in September, other data showed.
Economists are warning that the economy and labor market recovery from the COVID-19 slump could sputter without an infusion of new money from the government. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are working toward a bipartisan agreement for another fiscal package.
""The recovery's wheels are spinning in the sand,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""It's going to be a slow return to normal for the economy.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 837,000 for the week ended Sept. 26. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 850,000 applications in the latest week.
California is using the two-week pause to reduce its claims processing backlog and implement fraud prevention measures. The Labor Department acknowledged the suspension could result in ""significant"" week-to-week swings in initial claims ""unrelated to any changes in economic conditions."" 
Including a government-funded program for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs, 1.4 million claims were filed last week.
Though filings have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March, they remain well above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-2009 Great Recession. 
Labor market gains from the reopening of businesses are fading and economists are predicting a slowdown in hiring through the rest of this year and into 2021.
New coronavirus cases are rising, with a surge expected in the fall, which could lead to some restrictions being imposed on businesses in the services sector. In addition, political uncertainty is rising and could extend beyond the Nov. 3 presidential election, and make businesses reluctant to hire.
Several months after operations resumed, demand has remained poor, especially in the services sector, leading some establishments to permanently shut down and keeping job cuts elevated. Walt  Disney  Co. (N:DIS) said this week it would lay off roughly 28,000 employees in its theme parks division.
American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL), two of the largest U.S. carriers, said they were beginning furloughs of more than 32,000 workers on Thursday, without government funding.
""Likely more than one in three initial claims being filed are among people reopening a claim after initially going back to work and off of unemployment,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York. ""The other two-thirds represent the continued undertow of layoffs.""
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher as investors remained hopeful of fiscal stimulus. The dollar (DXY) dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 980,000 to 11.767 million in the week ending Sept. 19. But economists cautioned that part of the decline was probably due to people exhausting their 26-week eligibility for benefits.
At least 1.8 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Sept. 12, up 196,725 from the prior week. There were 26.5 million people receiving unemployment benefits during that period.
The government will publish its closely followed employment report on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 850,000 jobs in September after rising by 1.371 million in August, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave employment 10.7 million below its level in February.
Employment growth peaked in June when payrolls jumped by a record 4.781 million jobs. 
A separate report on Thursday from the Commerce Department showed personal income dropped 2.7% in August, reflecting a decrease in unemployment insurance benefits. A $600 unemployment subsidy ended in July and was replaced by a $300 supplement, whose funding is running out. Income increased 0.5% in July. 
The unemployment subsidy has helped to anchor consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, putting the economy on track for record growth in the third quarter after a historic plunge in the April-June period. 
Consumer spending increased 1.0% in August after rising 1.5% in July. Consumption remains 4% below its pre-pandemic level. Economists saw little boost from savings, which totaled $2.43 trillion in August. 

""There is enormous potential for economic growth in savings, but the fact Americans saved 14% of their income in August despite the loss of pandemic aid suggests the kind of caution that can limit an economic rebound,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""Those who have income to save are in no rush to spend it.""

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending gaining 0.8% in August. Construction spending shot up 2.5% on a year-on-year basis.
Spending on private construction projects surged 1.9%, fueled by investment in homebuilding amid record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-driven migration to suburbs and low density areas.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 55.4 last month from 56 in August, which was the highest level since November 2018. Despite last month's dip in the index, September marked the fourth straight month of growth. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11.3% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 56.3 in September.
The slowdown in manufacturing activity last month supports views that the recovery from the COVID-19 recession is losing steam as government money to help businesses and millions of unemployed runs out. In addition, new coronavirus cases are rising and infections are expected to accelerate in the fall. 
Gross domestic product is forecast topping a record 32% annualized rate in the third quarter after plunging at a historic 31.4% pace in the April-June period. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter have been cut to around a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace. 
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index decreased to 60.2 from a reading of 67.6 in August, which was the strongest since January 2004. The survey's measure of order backlogs at factories, however, rose as did orders for exports.
Factory employment continued to improve last month, but remained in contraction territory. The ISM's manufacturing employment gauge rose to a reading of 49.6 from 46.4 in August.
Coming on the heels of a report on Wednesday showing private payrolls increased more than expected last month, the improvement in hiring at factories bodes well for employment growth in September.

The government's closely followed employment report to be released on Friday is expected to show 850,000 jobs created in September after adding 1.371 million in August, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 10.7 million below their pre-pandemic level.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 56.0 in September, its highest level since August 2018, from 55.1 in the prior month. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
It was the fifth straight month that the index has climbed. It bottomed at a record low of 33.0 in April, when businesses were closed to help contain the coronavirus pandemic.
""Overall, the health of the Canadian manufacturing sector continued to strengthen in September, as has been the case throughout the third quarter,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
A strong increase in workforce numbers suggested ""a commitment towards expanding production schedules in the months to come,"" said Patel.
The employment index rose to 54.3 from 53.8 in August, while the measure of new orders was at its highest level since June 2018 at 57.7, up from 55.0. New export orders expanded for the second straight month.
Still, the pandemic continued to disrupt supply chains. The index of suppliers' delivery times edged up to 38.0 from 37.4 in August, holding well below the 50 threshold.
Canada has seen a resurgence of coronavirus cases in recent weeks. But economists expect activity to suffer a smaller hit than earlier this year, as provinces strive to avoid broad-based lockdowns and take targeted measures to deal with outbreaks.

Data on Wednesday showed that gross domestic product continued to rebound in July and August but was still about 5% below pre-pandemic levels.

Investing.com -- The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits fell by slightly more than expected last week but, at 837,000, still reflected abnormally high levels of layoffs six months into the coronavirus pandemic.
The number of continuing jobless claims, fell much more clearly, by nearly 1 million, to 11.767 million. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag to initial ones. 
The figures come with an important caveat: California has temporarily suspended reporting its data as it struggles to clear a backlog of unprocessed and modified claims. The state has put in place a "" two week reset period that will help expedite new claimant payments, reduce fraud and tackle backlog issues,"" according to the Californian Employment Development Department. 
Figures for the overall number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits, including Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, come with a lag of another week. They showed a rise of 454,000 to 26.53 million.
The data come a day after payrolls processor ADP reported that the private sector hired nearly 750,000 people in the month through mid-September, suggesting that workers are finding it easier to get rehired after the initial round of pandemic-related layoffs. 
Separately, fresh data showed the further erosion of consumers' willingness, or ability, to spend as a result of the pandemic. Personal incomes fell 2.7% in August, their third decline in four months, while personal spending  growth weakened to 1.0%, from a downwardly-revised 1.5% in July. The spending numbers showed that the personal consumer expenditure basket of prices, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, rose to 1.6%, above expectations for 1.4%.
The trajectory of both income and spending point to Americans dipping into their savings more to cover current expenses. The August savings rate of 14.1% was down from 17.7% in July, Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), said via Twitter although she noted this was still well off the crisis high of over 33%."

The layoffs reported by global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas on Thursday were up 2.6% from August and boosted total job cuts so far this year to a record 2.082 million. The previous all-time annual high was 1.957 million in 2001. Job cuts totaled 497,215 in the third quarter, down 59.8% from second quarter.
Companies announced 929,860 hiring intentions last month, bringing the total this year to 2.673 million. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) announced it would add 260,000 jobs as it reopens restaurants. 
""We are setting new records for job cuts even though things have improved since the earliest days of the pandemic,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray.
The rise in layoffs comes as companies have burned through government loans to help with wages. Funding for a reduced subsidy for the unemployed is also close to running out. Economists have warned that the labor market and broader economic recovery could sputter without another rescue package.
Companies attributed the planned layoffs last month to market conditions, weak demand, restructuring and COVID-19.
There were 32,099 job cuts at bars, restaurants, hotels and amusement parks in September, an 86% jump from August. That brought the total this year to 831,150. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) said on Tuesday it would lay off roughly 28,000 employees in its theme parks division. 
The aerospace/defense announced 18,971 layoffs last month. There were 16,628 cuts in the transportation sector.
""Especially if another relief package fails to pass, employers are going to enter the fourth quarter hesitant
to invest or spend,"" said Challenger.

The Labor Department will publish its closely watched, and broader, monthly employment report on Friday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased 850,000 by jobs in September after rising 1.371 million in August. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 10.7 million below their pre-pandemic level.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>",Euro zone factory recovery continued in September as Germany boomed,"By Jonathan Cable
LONDON (Reuters) - The recovery in euro zone manufacturing activity gathered pace last month but it was largely driven by strength in powerhouse Germany, and rising coronavirus cases across the region may yet reverse the upturn, a survey showed.
While the manufacturing sector is enjoying something of a revival, most market watchers and policymakers will focus on a survey for the bloc's dominant service industry, which accounts for around two-thirds of GDP, due on Monday. 
Its preliminary reading returned to contraction territory last month, suggesting renewed coronavirus-led lockdown restrictions were having an impact.
""If you look across the region, the fact is large numbers of services firms may no longer be viable in a world where we have a significant amount of COVID-19 restrictions in place and that means there could be a big employment shake out,"" said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank (DE:CBKG).""
Factories also cut headcount in September, albeit at a shallower pace than the previous month, and official data showed unemployment across the region rose to 8.1% in August.
As the pandemic raged across Europe governments imposed tough lockdowns. But as infection rates fell, many of those controls were removed. 
However, a resurgence in cases has meant some restrictions have now been reimposed.
That resurgence is the biggest threat to the recovering euro zone economy, according to a Reuters poll of economists last month, who said growth and inflation are more likely to create negative surprises over the coming year than positive ones. [ECILT/EU]
""Second wave effects carry a lot of uncertainty about the growth environment though. A new round of more national lockdowns could have a serious impact on the labour market again, which is not our base case, but cannot be ruled out either,"" said Bert Colijn at ING.
Still, surging demand after the initial relaxation pushed IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index to 53.7 in September from August's 51.7, in line with an earlier flash reading and its highest level since August 2018. 
Anything above 50 indicates growth.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI due on Monday and is seen as a good guide to economic health, bounced to its highest since February 2018.
Earlier figures showed factory output in Germany, Europe's largest economy, was booming - in contrast to modest production growth in France and Spain and slightly slower growth in Italy.
Without Germany, output growth would have weakened to the lowest since June, IHS Markit said.
Growth also slowed in Britain, outside the currency union, and the pace of the bounce-back is expected to weaken further in coming months as the government scales back its job subsidies and seeks to clamp down on rising COVID-19 cases. [GB/PMIM]
But with overall demand at a 2-1/2-year high, euro zone factories built up a backlog of work. Meanwhile, optimism about the coming 12 months climbed to a level not seen since before the U.S.-China trade war escalation in early 2018. 

The future output index rose to 63.8 from August's 61.5.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>","UK factories grow for fourth month, job losses slow: PMI","LONDON (Reuters) - British factory activity grew for a fourth month in a row in September, though more slowly than in August, and the sector cut the fewest jobs since before the COVID-19 lockdown, a survey showed on Thursday.
The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 54.1. That was down a touch from a preliminary reading of 54.3 and below August's two-and-a-half-year high of 55.2, but well above the 50.0 threshold denoting growth.
""Output and new orders increased as new work intakes improved from both domestic and overseas markets,"" IHS Markit said, pointing to more companies reopening after the lockdown and staff returning to work from temporary layoffs.
Britain's economy is recovering from its COVID-19 lockdown more quickly than predicted by the Bank of England and other forecasters, although it probably remains as much as 10% smaller than before the pandemic, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey has said.
The pace of the bounce-back is expected to slow in the coming months as the government scales back its job subsidies and seeks to clamp down on rising COVID-19 cases.
But Thursday's PMI survey for the manufacturing sector - which accounts for about 10% of Britain's economy - showed little sign of a slowdown in September.
The steepest increase in output was in intermediate goods, typically a sign that companies are investing in more equipment, and confidence was close to July's 28-month high. 
""However, there were also increased numbers of firms noting uncertainty about the path ahead, particularly regarding COVID-19 and Brexit,"" Markit said.
Jobs were lost for the eighth month in a row but at the slowest pace since February.

As demand picked up and raw materials became more expensive, the cost of inputs rose at the fastest pace in 21 months, leading manufacturers to raise their selling prices again.

IHS Markit's final Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, rose to 56.4 in September.
That was lower than a flash estimate of 56.6 but far higher than August's reading of 52.2.
Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said both orders and output were rising all across the manufacturing sector, helped by growing export demand.
""Even investment goods producers, who have generally underperformed in the recovery up to now, enjoyed a much better month in September,"" Smith said.

But he added that firms were still struggling financially, which could be seen in further job cuts and shrinking inventories.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its final purchasing managers' index rose to 51.2 in September from 49.8 in August. That was slightly up from a preliminary reading of 50.9 and further above the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions.
The survey showed that manufacturers' output and new orders from clients improved in September while confidence rose further despite a surge in new coronavirus cases to record levels.
IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said that the the good momentum could be derailed if infection rates continued to climb, triggering further restrictions.
""With the winter months approaching, we may yet see a renewed tightening of restrictions which would severely hinder the progress of many firms in the manufacturing sector,"" he said.

""A second lockdown would likely lead some goods producers to question the sustainability of their business models, with the virus potentially reducing factory capacity for a prolonged period,"" he added.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 12:50AM ET</span>",Australian job vacancies surge in the three months to August,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian job vacancies surged in the three months to August, official data showed on Thursday, as the easing of coronavirus restrictions across much of the country spurred demand for labour.
Job vacancies jumped a whopping 59.4% in the three months to August after a record 43.2% slump between March and May, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed. There were 4.5 unemployed people per vacancy over that period, down from 7.1 in the three months to May.
Vacancies were well below pre-pandemic levels in the state of Victoria, which is in a coronavirus lockdown, as well as in New South Wales, which saw a spillover of infections from Victoria's second wave of the novel coronavirus.
In contrast, vacancies were higher than pre-pandemic levels in Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia, and Northern Territory, signalling a rapid rebound in labour demand as mobility curbs to contain the virus eased.
Economists said interstate border restrictions could also have affected the ability of companies to fill positions.

The private sector was harder hit by the pandemic, with vacancies in there surging 65.4% in the three months to August after falling 44.9% in the three months to May. Public sector vacancies, meanwhile, increased 22% over that period, after a 29% fall the previous three months.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese business sentiment improved in July-September from a 11-year low hit three months ago, a key central bank survey showed, in a sign the economy is gradually emerging from the devastating hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
The data offers some hope for new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's efforts to achieve an economic revival from the crisis and pave the way for hosting next year's Tokyo Olympic Games.
But factory activity remained shaky and corporate capital expenditure plans were at their weakest since the 2009 global financial crisis, underscoring the challenge of pulling the world's third-largest economy sustainably out of its slump.
As the pandemic's pain persists, a ruling party heavyweight signalled Japan's readiness to compile a ""large-scale, bold"" additional spending package.
The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment improved to minus 27 in September, off a 11-year low of minus 34 in June but worse than a median market forecast of minus 23, the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" survey showed on Thursday.
While it showed many firms remain downbeat, it was the first sign of improvement in nearly three years.
""The big manufacturers' index turned out a little weaker than expected, reflecting an uneven recovery,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""Capital expenditure may weaken in coming months as companies put off non-urgent spending plans amid slumping profits,"" he said.
Big non-manufacurers' sentiment also recovered to minus 12 from minus 17 in June, worse than a Reuters poll of minus 9 but the first improvement in five quarters.
Both manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect conditions to improve three months ahead, giving new premier Suga some breathing space.
But some sectors fared better than others in a sign of the patchy nature of the recovery. While carmakers and restaurants saw demand pick up as lockdown measures were eased, machinery makers continued to suffer from sluggish orders.
Big firms plan to raise their capital expenditure by just 1.4% in the current business year to March 2021, lower than a 3.2% increase projected in June.
Total spending plans by companies of all size and industry for the current fiscal year fell 2.7%, the biggest drop marked in any September survey since fiscal 2009, the tankan showed.
""With uncertainty over the pandemic looming, it's doubtful whether corporate sentiment will recover medium- to long-term,"" said Yuichi Kodama, chief analyst at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
""The economy may stagnate after the effect of various government stimulus measures run their course,"" he said.
Factory activity posted its longest streak of declines on record in September, a separate private survey showed on Thursday, underscoring the huge toll the health crisis has taken on the manufacturing sector.
Japan suffered its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the pandemic and anti-virus measures crippled demand, and analysts expect any rebound to remain modest as fears of a second huge wave of infections weigh on consumption.
The BOJ has kept monetary policy steady since ramping up stimulus in March and April to cushion the economic blow.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has said the central bank stands ready to loosen policy further if Japan's recovery is derailed. But many analysts expect the central bank to stand pat for the time being given its limited tool-kit to prop up growth.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls accelerate in September; many challenges loom,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in September, but diminishing government financial assistance and a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases in some parts of the country could slow the labor market's recovery from the pandemic.
Other data on Wednesday confirmed that the economy suffered its sharpest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter because of the disruptions from the coronavirus. Record growth is predicted in the third quarter, buoyed by fiscal stimulus and the resumption of many business operations. 
But without another rescue package, rising coronavirus infections and political uncertainty that could extend beyond the Nov. 3 presidential election, gross domestic product estimates for the fourth quarter are being slashed.
""With economic momentum cooling, fiscal stimulus expiring, flu season approaching and election uncertainty rising, the main question is how strong the labor market will be going into the fourth quarter,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
Private payrolls increased by 749,000 jobs this month after rising 481,000 in August, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would rise by 650,000 in September. Employment gains were spread across all industries and company size.
Manufacturing payrolls increased by 130,000 jobs and employment at construction sites rose 60,000. Hiring in the services industries advanced 552,000, with trade, transportation and utilities leading the gains.
The ADP report is jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics. Though it has fallen short of the government's private payrolls count since May because of methodology differences, it is still watched for clues on the labor market's health. 
The ADP report is based on active and paid employees on company payrolls. The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) counts workers as employed if they received a paycheck during the week that includes the 12th of the month.
When businesses were shuttered in mid-March, millions of workers were either laid off or furloughed. Economists say the return of furloughed workers when most businesses reopened in May boosted the payrolls numbers reported by the government.
New weekly applications for jobless aid have stalled at higher levels after dropping below 1 million in August as the government changed the way it strips seasonal fluctuations from the data. Data from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed fewer employees at work in September relative to August.
New daily COVID-19 cases started spiking last week for the first time in eight weeks. Infections are expected to rise in the fall, which economists believe will lead to some restrictions being imposed on businesses in the services sector.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar declined against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

""The big gains from business re-openings are fading,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""Job growth will slow through the rest of 2020 and in 2021."" 
The government is scheduled to publish its closely followed employment report, which includes public workers, on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls probably increased by 850,000 jobs in September after rising 1.027 million in August. 
With government employment expected to be held back by the departure of some temporary workers hired for the 2020 Census and coronavirus-related budget challenges at state and local governments, nonfarm payrolls are forecast advancing by 850,000 in September after increasing 1.371 million in August.
That would leave employment 10.7 million below its level in February. Employment growth peaked in June when payrolls jumped by a record 4.781 million jobs. 
In a separate report on Wednesday, the Commerce Department said GDP plunged at a 31.4% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest drop in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. That was revised up from the 31.7% pace reported last month and reflected a less sharp collapse in consumer spending than initially estimated.
The government also published data on contributions to GDP by industry, which underscored the havoc wreaked by the virus. 
Private goods-producing industries contracted at a 34.4% rate, while services tumbled at a 33.1% pace, and government decreased at a rate of 16.6%. 
After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment dropped at a revised rate of 10.5%. Profits were previously estimated to have declined at a 11.7% pace. When measured from the income side, the economy contracted at a 33.5% rate in the second quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) was previously reported to have declined at a 33.1% pace.
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, decreased at a 32.5% rate last quarter. That was revised from the 32.4% rate estimated last month.
Third-quarter GDP growth estimates are topping a 32% rate as evidenced by a strong housing market and turnaround in business investment.

Growth estimates for the October-December quarter have been lowered to around a 2.5% rate from above a 10% pace.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian economy continued to expand in July and August, clawing back from a steep drop due to the coronavirus pandemic, though the pace of growth slowed through the summer, Statistics Canada data and estimates showed on Wednesday.
Real GDP rose 3.0% in July, in line with analysts' expectations, but below June gains of 6.5%, as all 20 industrial sectors posted increases. 
August GDP, meanwhile, is expected to increase by 1.0%, Statistics Canada said in a preliminary flash estimate. 
The economy still remains below pre-pandemic levels and a recent uptick in COVID-19 cases is raising concerns over fresh containment measures. 
The Canadian dollar  was trading 0.2% higher at 1.3366 to the greenback, or 74.82 U.S. cents, after the data. 
""While there may be some disappointment with the August growth estimate of 1%, decelerating momentum should be fully expected,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, Canadian rates and macro strategist with BMO Capital Markets, in a note.
""Perhaps the bigger concern is that a second wave of COVID cases could prompt another round of shutdowns, or a broader slowing in activity, when the economy still faces a deep hole to dig out of,"" he added.
Canada reported 1,660 new COVID-19 cases on Sept 29, taking the total to 156,961. Canada's two largest provinces, where new infections have surged to spring levels, pledged measures this week to slow the second wave.
July's GDP gains included big increases for the accommodation and food service sectors, which benefited from summer travel, patio service and restaurant reopenings.
All 20 industrial sectors posted increases in July, with the goods-producing industries gaining 3.2%, while the service-producing industries grew by 3.0%.
With the summer gains, third-quarter annualized GDP growth is on track to increase at more than 40%, said Nathan Janzen, senior economist with RBC Economics, in a note.
""But the level of activity overall was also still running almost 5% below pre-shock levels,"" he added.

The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, jumped 8.8% to an all-time high of 132.8 last month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, rising 3.4% in August.
Pending home sales increased 24.2% from a year ago. The housing market has pressed ahead even as the COVID-19 pandemic has thrown millions out of work. The unemployment burden has fallen disproportionately on low-wage earners in the services industry, who tend to be young. 
There has been a surge in demand for housing in suburbs and low-density areas as Americans seek spacious accommodation in the new work-from-home era. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is averaging below 3%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Reports this month showed a surge in homebuilder confidence in September, and an acceleration in single-family home construction and sales of both new and previously owned homes in August.

U.S. gross domestic product shrank at a 31.4% annualized rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department’s third estimate showed Wednesday. Twenty of 22 industry groups contributed to the decrease in output during the period. The category of arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation and food services plummeted an annualized 91.5% and subtracted about 6.6 percentage points from GDP.
Covid-19 and the measures taken to curb its spread catapulted the U.S. economy into the deepest contraction since at least the 1940s. Retail sales and housing are among some areas of the economy that have since rebounded, surpassing pre-pandemic levels and setting up third-quarter economic growth to be the strongest on record.
The MNI Chicago Business Barometer on Wednesday jumped in September to the highest reading since the end of 2018, underscoring a resurgence in manufacturing. Orders and production grew at faster rates than a month earlier.
The labor market, however, still has a long way to go. The total value of economic output will likely remain below pre-pandemic levels when the government issues its first GDP estimate for the July to September period on Oct. 29.
A separate report from ADP Research Institute on Wednesday showed companies added 749,000 jobs in September, more than forecast. Still, ADP’s measure of private employment is more than 10 million below its pre-pandemic level.
Transportation and warehousing, which includes airlines, suffered an almost 65% annualized decline in output during the second quarter, while manufacturing dropped at a 36.6% pace. Retail trade decreased 31.2%, education and health care fell nearly 47%, and business services were down about 30%. Other service-related business excluding government declined an at a 58.8% annual rate.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German retail sales rose much more than expected in August and unemployment fell further in September, boosting hopes that household spending in Europe's largest economy will power a strong recovery in the third quarter from the coronavirus shock.
The upbeat data, released by the Federal Statistics Office and the Labour Office on Wednesday, came as rising infection numbers were clouding the growth outlook for the fourth quarter.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Finance Minister Olaf Scholz have since March unleashed an unprecedented array of rescue and stimulus measures to help companies and consumers recover as quickly as possible from Germany's deepest recession on record.
The packages include unlimited liquidity aid for struggling companies, a massive job protection scheme to shield workers from sudden unemployment as well as cash handouts for parents and a temporary value added tax cut to boost domestic demand.
There had been some doubt whether the VAT cut, valid from July 1 to Dec. 31, was actually working, as some companies seemed not to be passing it on to consumers.
But figures released by the Federal Statistics Office on Wednesday showed retail sales jumped by 3.1% on the month in real terms in August after an upwardly revised drop of 0.2% in July. This easily beat a Reuters forecast of only 0.5%.
Retail sales rose by 3.7% in real terms from a year ago, after an upwardly revised increase of 5.0% the previous month.
Compared with February, the month before the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany, retail sales in August were 5.8% higher, suggesting the sector has already put the crisis behind it.
Demand was particularly strong for furnishings and household appliances with year-on-year increase of 8%.
Online retailers continued to benefit from shifting consumer habits with a 23% jump in sales, which came at the expense of clothing and shoe stores which suffered a 10% drop.
Business associations have warned that the pandemic is accelerating a structural transformation in retailing as consumers move online and away from small stores in cities.
GHOST TOWNS
""Politicians urgently need to take countermeasures at all levels, otherwise we will see that large areas of our city centres will turn into ghost towns,"" said Stefan Genth from the HDE retail association.
HDE said last week it expected nominal sales to grow by 1.5% this year despite the pandemic, a sharp upward revision from its previous estimate of a 4% drop. It pointed to booming online sales and the government's stimulus measures.
In a further good sign for household spending, unemployment fell for the third month in a row in September, separate labour office data showed.
The number of people out of work fell by 8,000 in seasonally adjusted terms to 2.907 million and the unemployment rate eased to 6.3% from 6.4% in the previous month.
The number of people on short-time work schemes, which have shielded the labour market from the brunt of the pandemic, dropped to 4.24 million in July from its April peak of nearly 6 million.
The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic.
The Ifo institute expects 6.6% output growth in the third quarter, then slowing to 2.8% in the fourth quarter.

The government expects the economy to shrink by 5.8% this year, which would translate into a calendar-adjusted decline of 6.1% and the sharpest contraction since World War Two.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",UK GDP collapsed nearly 20% in second quarter in historic COVID hit,"By David Milliken and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain suffered a record collapse in economic output in the second quarter of 2020 when COVID-19 lockdown measures were in full force, though the decline was slightly smaller than first estimated.
Gross domestic product shrank by 19.8% in the three months to June, the Office for National Statistics said, slightly less than the initial estimate of a quarterly 20.4% crash but still more than for any other major advanced economy.
The fall was the biggest since the ONS records began in 1955. Other data has suggested Britain is on course for its biggest annual fall since the 1920s.
Britain's economy had already shrunk by 2.5% in the January-March period as the country entered lockdown in late March.
Output has rebounded in recent months but the recovery looks to be fading with rising coronavirus cases and forecasts of a jump in unemployment as the government scales back job support.
""The renewed COVID-19 restrictions will probably mean that GDP stagnates in Q4, leaving economic activity marooned 5.5% short of its pre-crisis level,"" Ruth Gregory of consultancy Capital Economics said.
""And the risk now is that renewed containment measures send the recovery into reverse,"" she added.
Households saved a record 29.1% of their income, up from 9.6% in the first quarter, as they were unable to spend in many shops and restaurants during the lockdown, while incomes were supported by a government job programme which ends next month.
HEAVY TOLL 
Britain has suffered Europe's highest death toll from COVID-19, with more than 42,000 fatalities.
Compared with a year earlier, Britain's second quarter output tumbled 21.5% - the same as in Spain - while France reported a 19.0% drop.
The statistics office said differences in how countries estimated public sector activity - especially whether they focused on money spent or used the ONS's approach of looking at the extent of disruption to normal services - complicated international comparisons.
Nonetheless, it said Britain's economy shrank more than any other Group of Seven economy in the first half of 2020.
There have been some bright spots in the recovery.
Retail spending exceeded pre-pandemic levels in July and August - driven by a boom in online shopping, groceries and home improvement - and figures on Wednesday showed the biggest annual rise in house prices in more than four years.
However, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has warned the expansion is likely to lose pace, with unemployment set to rise to 7.5% later this year, some parts of the economy facing new COVID restrictions and headwinds from a fresh jump in cases.
Britain's current account deficit - normally one of its weak spots - shrank sharply to 2.8 billion pounds ($3.6 billion), or 0.6% of GDP, reaching its smallest in nine years as a result of the slump in global trade caused by the pandemic.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Saudi economy shrank by 7% in second quarter as coronavirus hit,"By Davide Barbuscia
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's economy shrank by 7% in the second quarter, a sign of how deeply the new coronavirus hit both the oil and non-oil sectors, official data showed on Wednesday.
The world’s largest oil exporter is facing a deep recession after the COVID-19 pandemic curbed global crude demand and measures to contain the coronavirus hurt domestic activity.
""The private sector and the government sector recorded a negative growth rate of 10.1% and 3.5%, respectively,"" said the General Authority for Statistics.
In the first quarter, Saudi Arabia posted a 1% economic contraction, but that only captured part of the oil price collapse and the pandemic impact, which escalated in March.
Back then, the oil sector slumped by 4.6%, while the non-oil sector posted a positive growth rate of 1.6%.
But the coronvirus-driven lockdowns were bound to impact the Saudi economy hard in the second quarter.
The non-oil sector, which is the focus of Saudi reforms aimed at diversifying the economy away from crude revenues, shrank by 8.2%, while the oil sector declined by 5.3%, the statistics authority said.
""No surprises in the pace of decline. Non-oil GDP was going to be hit harder with the lockdowns. Oil contraction instead was partly limited by the marked ramp up in oil output in April,"" said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
""More important is going to be the ongoing impact of Covid and the continued low oil price. Fiscal retrenchment and tightening will result in a weak domestic economic backdrop and a weak outlook for private sector job creation for nationals,"" she said.
Saudi Arabia tripled a value-added tax in July to boost non-oil revenues, but that is limiting domestic demand, dampening economic recovery.
Consumer spending fell 5.5% year on year in August, as the VAT hike kicked in, said Arqaam Capital, citing August central bank data. Inflation meanwhile spiked to 6.2% in August, due to the VAT increase.
The tax hike ""weighs on disposable income, and largely offsets the benefit of travel restrictions that drive local demand,"" Arqaam said in a research note, referring to expectations of higher domestic demand as Saudi Arabia's borders were shut to contain the virus outbreak.

1428,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",A tale of two Britains: homes market boom deepens social divide,"By Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Claire Tomlinson dreams of buying a three-bedroom house in the leafy northern English town of Sandbach but now finds herself priced out of the market, a story that is becoming all too familiar in Britain in the pandemic era.
The 28-year-old e-commerce worker and her partner were saving diligently while renting in Sandbach so they could buy their own home this year, an ambition that has been thwarted by forces beyond their control.
A post-lockdown stampede for bigger houses outside of urban areas in the new work-from-home age has sparked a fresh boom in Britain's housing market - especially in areas like Sandbach, a small country town surrounded by the rolling Cheshire Plains.
While this dash for the countryside is not a phenomenon unique to Britain, its decision to suspend taxes on residential property purchases till April 2021 has turbocharged the market. 
Now house prices have risen to record highs, some 3-4% above their pre-pandemic level - a stark contrast to the battered economy which may be on course for its biggest annual contraction in around 100 years.
The housing market has been one of the starkest manifestations of social and wealth inequality in Britain for many years, and first-time buyers like Tomlinson already faced a daunting task to haul themselves onto the property ladder.
Now, the intensifying competition and rising prices during the pandemic, which coincide with an imminent reduction in a longstanding state support scheme for first-time buyers, make it all but impossible for many people to afford to own their home.
""It's so disappointing,"" said Tomlinson. 
""You try to follow the advice, be financially responsible and save enough money for a deposit. But when you actually try to buy somewhere, you realise the system is broken.""
Last week property website Rightmove (OTC:RTMVY) said average asking prices for homes with three or four bedrooms hit a record high across Britain during September.
""Needing more space has always been the most popular reason for moving house, but now there's a new urgency for extra space to be able to work from home,"" said Tim Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data.
""Buyers (are) competing for the same type of property."" 
HAVES VS HAVE-NOTS
Britain's housing market has long been a story of winners and losers. Now the coronavirus pandemic is likely to deepen the sector's role as a driver of inequality.
The rate of home ownership among people aged 25 to 34 has fallen sharply over the last few decades, from 67% in 1991 to around 40% today, according to government data.
Six years ago, Britain sought to boost home ownership via the state-backed equity loan programme, called Help to Buy, for newly built houses worth up to 600,000 pounds ($770,000).
Tomlinson looked seriously at using Help to Buy, but found that the scheme was due to be scaled back significantly next March, when the 600,000-pound price cap will be cut to just 224,400 pounds for the northwest of England.
Since the average price of a new-build house in Cheshire East stands at around 330,000 pounds, the chances of finding a home in Sandbach eligible for the scaled-back support looked slim.
As it stands, homebuyers are increasingly likely to come from already well-off families.
Recent research from insurance company Legal and General showed 33% of Britons who are likely to buy a house in the next five years plan to do so with their parents' financial backing - up from 19% in 2019.
    Neil Wilson, chief executive at Legal and General, said this was a ""symptom of our broken housing market"".
""Unfortunately, we don't have the luxury of relying on wealthy parents to help buy a house,"" Tomlinson said.
Property website Zoopla said the share of homes purchased by first-time buyers fell in September for the first time in five years, probably reflecting how lenders started to withdraw high ""loan-to-value"" mortgage products, which require lower deposits, in early June.
UNCERTAIN FUTURE
The outlook for the housing market next year is tough to predict, given the vast uncertainties surrounding COVID-19.
But a surge in unemployment is clearly underway. Britain's official jobless rate rose slightly to 4.1% in the three months to the end of July, and the Bank of England has forecast it will hit 7.5% by the end of this year after furloughs are ended.
Previous spikes in joblessness during the early 1990s and then the financial crisis prompted hefty drops in house prices, and there is little reason to think it will be a different story this time round.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) pencilled in a 7% drop in house prices next year while a Reuters poll published on Tuesday showed analysts expected this year's rise to turn into stagnation of prices in 2021.
However, a fall or a levelling out of house prices would not necessarily make for a more equal and accessible market.
Many workers in the food, accommodation and cultural sectors are likely to be left unemployed soon - industries that are more likely to hire younger people on lower wages, many of who already struggled to buy a house.
For now, prospective homebuyers like Tomlinson face a long wait to buy their own home.
""It looks like we'll be renting for some time to come,"" she said.

1429,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>","Chinese Data Positive on Recovery, But Challenges Remain","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – The Chinese economy continues its path toward recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but nagging unemployment and rising U.S.-China tensions could prove to be roadblocks to that recovery.
Data released earlier in the day by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that official purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) for September remained above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. The manufacturing PMI was 51.5, beating the forecast 51.2 and August’s 51 readings and the non-manufacturing PMI was 55.9 against August’s 55.2.
A private survey released on the same day also showed the manufacturing sector remaining in the growth territory. However, the Caixin manufacturing PMI of 53 was slightly under the forecast 53.1 and August’s 53.1 figures.
“The recovery in manufacturing has maintained its momentum in the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, with both the supply and demand surging,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in a note accompanying the Caixin survey release.
The growth in factory activity was boosted by exports, which returned to growth after seeing several months of shrinking sales from the economic paralysis brought on by COVID-19 in the beginning of the year.
“The sharp rise in overseas demand has complemented the domestic market,” Wang added.
Despite the positive news, some investors warned that there could be bumps ahead as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on.
""Although overall manufacturing demand has improved, the industry has recovered unevenly,"" NBS official Zhao Qinghe, noting weak demand particularly for clothing and wood processing manufacturing.
""In addition, COVID-19 has not yet been fully and effectively controlled, and there are still uncertain factors in China's imports and exports,"" Zhang added.
Unemployment remains a critical issue in the recovery, with a sub-index for employment for September standing at 49.6 against August’s 49.4. But with the index remaining in contraction, the government could dole out more support measures.
“... The job market remains worrisome, as the improvement in employment relies on a longer-term economic recovery and a more stable external environment. In the near future, great uncertainties remain about the overseas pandemic and the U.S. presidential election,” Caixin’s Wang said.
Simmering tensions with the U.S. over issues such as trade, technology, Taiwan and Hong Kong could undercut the economic recovery, with the tensions widely expected to escalate further ahead of the presidential election in November.
Forecasts also predict that China's economy, which grew 3.2% in the second quarter year-on-year, will reduce that growth to 2.2%, the weakest in over three decades, in 2020."
1430,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 11:20PM ET</span>",China's factory activity accelerates at solid pace in September on boost from overseas demand,"By Gabriel Crossley
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity extended solid growth in September, twin surveys showed, as the nation's crucial exports engine revved up on improving overseas demand and underlined a steady economic recovery from the coronavirus shock.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 51.5 in September from 51.0 in August, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Wednesday, remaining above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction for the seventh month.
Analysts had expected it to pick up slightly to 51.2.
A private survey, also released on the day, painted a similar picture of the manufacturing sector gaining momentum backed by stronger overseas demand. 
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy, as pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion and surprisingly resilient exports propel a recovery.
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, also showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 50.8 in September, improving from 49.1 a month earlier and snapping eight months of declines.
The signs of stronger overseas demand were also highlighted in the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI), which focuses more on small and export-oriented firms. Its gauge for new export orders rose at the fastest pace in over three years.
Recently, economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices have all suggested a further pick up in the industrial sector. Profits at China's industrial firms extended robust growth in August to the fourth month, official data showed on Sunday.
Domestic demand also shows signs of broadening, with industrial output accelerating the most in eight months in August and retail sales growing for the first time this year.
Adding to the demand recovery from the coronavirus-induced slump, the official PMI showed activity in China's services sector expanded at a faster pace in September.
"" (W)e are entering a period of above trend growth, which should help absorb the remaining slack in the labour market and allow for some policy tightening next year,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
CHALLENGES AHEAD
Yet, even as China emerges from the pandemic in fairly stable shape, many expect the road ahead to be bumpy. 
China's economy, which grew 3.2% in the second quarter year-on-year, is set to expand 2.2% this year - the weakest in over three decades.
A sub-index for employment in the official PMI improved slightly but remained in contractionary territory. It stood at 49.6 in September from 49.4 the month before, indicating the pressure on jobs and keeping policymakers primed for more support measures. 
Moreover, a growing rift between China and the United States over trade, technology and a range of other issues have analysts warning about risks to the outlook. Tensions between the two countries are expected to escalate further ahead of the U.S. Presidential election in November, which some China observers say could undercut the recovery.
""Although overall manufacturing demand has improved, the industry has recovered unevenly,"" said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the NBS, in comments accompanying the data, noting weaknesses in demand for clothing and wood processing manufacturing in particular.

""In addition, the global epidemic has not yet been fully and effectively controlled, and there are still uncertain factors in China's imports and exports.""

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 11:15PM ET</span>",U.S. housing market to remain a bright spot in a weak economy: Reuters poll,"By Hari Kishan and Richa Rebello
BENGALURU (Reuters) - U.S. house prices will continue to surge well into next year and beyond, outpacing inflation and the overall economy, a Reuters poll of property analysts found, making it a bright spot against an otherwise gloomy economic backdrop.
In a stark reversal, the U.S. housing market - at the epicenter of the global financial crisis more than a decade ago - was expected to extend a helping hand to an economy severely battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Buoyed by record-low interest rates and strong pent-up demand from a segment of the workforce largely unaffected by pandemic-induced job cuts, house prices will continue to rise over the next two years, the Sept. 15-29 poll of over 40 analysts showed. 
U.S. house prices were predicted to rise 4.0% this year and by an average 3.5% in 2021 and 2022. That suggests the trend since 2013 of house price rises outpacing consumer inflation would continue for the next three years at least, according to current inflation expectations. 
Underscoring the view that the latest data showing a surge in house prices was not just a blip, over 60% of analysts, or 24 of 39 who responded to an additional question, said that trend would continue to hold for at least another year. The remaining 15 said less than a year.
""Three factors support relatively high home prices - undersupply after a decade of underbuilding, single-family housing attractiveness in a socially distancing world, and most importantly low interest rates,"" said Nathaniel Karp, chief U.S. economist at BBVA (MC:BBVA). 
""However, economic uncertainty remains elevated and the recovery after the pandemic could take time, which are the risks to the current valuations.""
U.S. house prices outlook: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xlbvgjmgepq/Reuters%20Poll-U.S.%20house%20prices%20outlook.PNG
Already tight inventory levels have been squeezed to record lows after construction activity came to a grinding halt because of the coronavirus pandemic, and with no policy relief expected, home buyers may outbid each other and crank up prices.
Existing home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 million units in August, the highest since the tail end of the previous housing boom in 2006, and were expected to average around 5.5 million units in the coming year.
""A surge in demand has put further strain on an already tight inventory. The latest supply of existing homes dropped below three months (of inventory) for the first time since records began in 1982, and that implies sales will ease back toward the end of the year,"" said Matthew Pointon, property economist at Capital Economics.
When asked to rate the affordability on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 as extremely cheap and 10 as very expensive, the poll gave a median of 7, up from 6 in the previous poll when predictions were for house prices to rise at a slower pace than currently expected.

""U.S. home prices are not yet at a level that is concerning,"" said Matthew Gardner, chief economist at Windermere Real Estate. ""That said, we need significant growth in the number of new homes built to meet current demand. If more units are not provided, we could see unsustainable upward price pressure in the resale market.""

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 08:40PM ET</span>",Japan's factory output rises for third month,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rose for the third straight month in August, in a positive sign for manufacturers as economic activity gradually recovered further from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Demand among Japan's global trading partners, and especially China, has come off lows seen earlier this year when the virus crisis forced governments to impose lockdowns that hurt global trade and production.
Separate data showed retail sales posted their sixth straight month of declines in August as consumers turned to saving instead of spending largely due to worries over a fragile economic recovery.
Official data released on Wednesday showed factory output increased 1.7% in August from the previous month, boosted by rising production of automobiles and car parts as well as iron, steel and non-ferrous metals.
August's rise, which was slower than the previous month's record 8.7% gain, came in largely in line with the median market forecast of 1.5% growth in a Reuters poll of economists.
Manufacturers expect output to rise 5.7% in September and 2.9% in October, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said.
""If September's forecast is realised, manufacturing output would rebound by 10% quarter-on-quarter this quarter,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics in a note.
""Both gross domestic production and manufacturing activity still have plenty more lost ground to make up.""
The government raised its assessment of industrial production a notch to say it was picking up.
In a sign of Japan's struggle to shake off weak consumer demand, retail sales fell 1.9% in August from the previous year, declining for the sixth month, separate data showed on Wednesday.
The fall was not as sharp as a 3.5% drop seen by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed a 2.8% drop in July.
The world's third-largest economy posted its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter as the COVID-19 crisis paralysed business and consumer demand.
It had already slipped into contraction late last year as consumer sentiment slumped after the government last October raised the nationwide sales tax to repair its extremely heavy public debt burden.

1435,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence posts biggest gain in 17 years; downside risks remain,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded by the most in 17 years in September amid an improvement in labor market views, but it remained below levels that prevailed before the COVID-19 pandemic struck the nation early this year.
The surge in confidence reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday came despite a resurgence in new coronavirus cases in some parts of the country and government help for businesses and the unemployed drying up. Consumers also appeared to shrug off growing uncertainty ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election and signs the economy's recovery from the recession was slowing.
""While today's figure is on the face of it a fantastic result, we have to remain a little cautious given the mixed evidence from other sources,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York.
The Conference Board's consumer confidence index increased 15.5 points to a reading of 101.8 this month. That was the largest gain since April 2003. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to a reading of 89.5 in September. The index was at 132.6 in February.
The cutoff date for the survey was Sept. 18. The jump in the Conference Board's confidence index is at odds with a modest increase in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment gauge. Economists said the rise in the Conference Board measure was driven by higher-income households, who have been least affected by unemployment during the pandemic.
""High confidence today reflects reopened activity but also policy's success in ring-fencing the impact from the loss of activity. This is not the moment to open the gates,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at TS Lombard in New York. ""It underscores the recession's narrow impact.""
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, increased to a reading of 98.5 from 85.8 in August. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions jumped to 104.0 from a reading of 86.6 in August.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, improved to a reading of 2.9 this month from -2.2 in August. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. It has dropped from as high as 38.3 in August last year.
Consumers were upbeat on their income prospects. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower ahead of the first presidential debate. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.

DOWNSIDE RISKS
New daily COVID-19 cases started spiking last week for the first time in eight weeks. Government programs to help businesses with wages have almost lapsed, and tens of thousands of airline workers are facing layoffs or furloughs in October.
A $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement ended in July and was replaced with a $300 weekly subsidy, whose funding is already running out. 
""Households are becoming more optimistic on the labor market and income front, which should support consumer spending in the coming months,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""However, the possibility that increased unemployment benefits could expire serves as a strong countervailing force."" 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the trade deficit in goods widened in August, with imports surging as businesses rebuild inventories which were depleted early in the pandemic. 
Trade balance: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwjkakvw/tradebal.png
That, however, did not change expectations for a record jump in gross domestic product in the third quarter after output plunged in the April-June period at its steepest pace since 1947. The economy, which slipped into recession in February, received a boost over the summer from the reopening of businesses and fiscal stimulus from the government. 
The goods trade gap increased 3.5% to a record $82.9 billion last month. Imports of goods rose 3.1% to $201.3 billion, eclipsing a 2.8% increase in goods exports to $118.3 billion. 
The rise in imports was led by consumer goods, which jumped 7%. There were also strong gains in imports of food, capital and consumer goods. But imports of industrial supplies fell 4.6%.
Exports of consumer goods, industrial supplies and food rose. But capital goods and motor vehicles and parts shipments fell. Trade could be a drag on growth in the third quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2019. 
But with much of the imports going to replenish inventories, the hit to GDP growth could be modest.
The Commerce Department also reported that retail inventories increased 0.8% in August after rebounding 1.2% in July. Motor vehicle and parts inventories gained 0.6%.
Retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, the component that goes into the calculation of GDP, shot up 0.9% after climbing 0.6% in July.

Wholesale inventories rebounded 0.5% in August after dipping 0.1% in the prior month. Inventory accumulation is expected to contribute to GDP growth in the third quarter after subtracting from output for five straight quarters.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's government posted a primary budget deficit of 96.1 billion reais ($17 billion) in August, the Treasury said on Monday, as the coronavirus crisis continued to necessitate huge emergency spending.
The deficit, excluding interest payments, was slightly less than the 98.7 billion reais deficit economists in a Reuters poll had predicted. The shortfall, excluding interest payments, expanded in the first eight months of the year to 601.3 billion reais.
That compares with an accumulated deficit of 52.1 billion reais in the same period last year, Treasury said.
In the 12 months to August, the deficit totaled 647.8 billion reais, or 9% of gross domestic product, Treasury said. The government's 2020 forecast is for a record-busting primary deficit of 871 billion reais, or 12.1% of GDP, assuming the economy shrinks this year by 4.7%.
Net revenues in August rose nearly 6% in real terms from the same month last year to 102.1 billion reais, mainly due to the partial reversal of certain tax deferrals, Treasury said.
Spending in August was 74% higher at 198.1 billion reais, Treasury said. This included 93 billion reais on crisis-fighting measures, including 45.3 billion on emergency transfers to millions of Brazil's poorest people and 15 billion reais support for local governments.
Gross government debt may reach 94% of GDP this year, well above the average across emerging countries of 62% of GDP projected for this year, Treasury said.
""The crisis facing the country could turn into a promising moment for advancing reforms, focusing on fiscal consolidation and productivity in the economy,"" Treasury said in a statement.

""Only the continuity of the reform agenda can maintain an economic environment that will attract investment, with low interest rates and inflation under control, allowing sustainable growth, which is fundamental .... to control (the) public debt,"" it said.

Consumer prices declined 0.4% in September, the steepest pace in more than five years. Europe’s largest economy is suffering a double blow from tepid consumption and a sales-tax cut the government introduced earlier this year to bolster the economy.
The drop that exceeded all but one forecasts in a Bloomberg survey follows a report showing consumer prices in Spain slid for a sixth straight month. It also suggests inflation in the euro area might come in below the -0.2% expected by economists. September data for the 19-nation bloc are due on Friday.
While the trend won’t surprise the ECB -- President Christine Lagarde has flagged such declines for the coming months -- some policy makers have started sounding the alarm.
Executive Board member Fabio Panetta has argued that the risk of providing too much stimulus is smaller than being “too shy,” and Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said weak price pressures show there is “no room for complacency.” Lagarde and many of her colleagues, including ECB chief economist Philip Lane, will speak during a conference on Wednesday.
According to the ECB’s own forecasts, inflation is unlikely to reach its target of just under 2% for the foreseeable future, with a stronger euro an additional burden.
Economists expect the ECB to boost its 1.35 trillion ($1.6 trillion) emergency bond-buying program later this year, most likely in December when new forecasts become available.

Mortgage approvals jumped to 84,700 from 66,300 in July, hitting their highest level since October 2007.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected about 71,000 approvals. 
Mortgage lending rose by a weaker-than-expected 3.1 billion pounds ($4.0 billion) in July.
But consumer borrowing - a key driver of economic growth - increased by only around 300 million pounds in August from July compared with a median forecast for a 1.45 billion pound increase in the Reuters poll.
Alistair McQueen, head of savings and retirement at insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV), said many households were likely to start saving more in anticipation of further economic turmoil caused by the reintroduction of stricter local lockdown measures.
""This will dent consumer spending, which will curb the UK’s economic recovery.”
Compared with August last year, consumer borrowing sank by 3.9%, the sharpest fall since the BoE began measuring the data in 1994.

The European Commission's monthly survey showed sentiment in the 19 countries sharing the euro rising to 91.1 points this month from 87.5 in August, beating market expectations of an improvement to 89.0 points.
The gains were mainly a result of sentiment in services, the euro zone economy's biggest sector producing some two thirds of gross domestic product, improving to -11.1 from -17.2. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise to only -15.7.
Optimism in industry rose to -11.1 from -12.8, falling short of expectations of a rise to -10.0 and consumer sentiment was in line with expectations rising to -13.9 from -14.7.

Inflation expectations in industry improved to -0.6 from -2.1 but continued to fall among consumers, easing to 12.5 from 16.9 in August.

INSEE's consumer confidence index held at 95, after a single point upwards revision for the month of August, beating the average forecast of 94 in a Reuters poll.
Household confidence about personal finances edged higher, rising above the long-term average for the first time since February, when the coronavirus epidemic first began sweeping across France.
There was also a slight increase in those prepared to make big purchases. However, the number of people who said it was a good time to save jumped higher for a fifth straight month. 
Household concerns about unemployment inched higher. France has avoided a major spike in permanent unemployment as companies put workers on state-subsidised furloughs en masse.

Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. Its use is intended to stop immediate shocks such as the coronavirus crisis from turning into mass unemployment.

The value of U.S. goods bought by China declined from the previous month, led by a slowdown in energy products, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Customs Administration data. By the end of August, China had purchased about 32.8% of the full-year target of more than $170 billion -- meaning it must buy about $115 billion of goods in the remaining four months of the year to comply with the agreement signed in January.

Purchases of energy products fell by 24% in August from the previous month, hitting about 14% of the full-year target. While China’s crude oil imports from the U.S. dropped substantially from a record high in July, they are likely to rise in coming months as purchases of American crude rose before the August review of the trade deal.
The U.S. and China reaffirmed their commitment to the phase-one trade deal in August, demonstrating a willingness to cooperate even as tensions rise over a range of issues.
China cut its pork imports from the U.S. by nearly 40% in August from a month earlier, while increasing its purchases of cereals, the data showed. Imports of soybeans, one of the key products in the trade deal, rose almost 300% from a month earlier and are likely to trend higher as the U.S. harvest picks up.

Sixty percent of business owners said they will be able to remain open for more than a half-year, up from 46% in April, according to the poll, conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ). The survey firm questioned owners and decision makers at 600 small and midsize firms from Aug. 26 to Sept. 4.
As prospects of a new stimulus deal remain slim after negotiations stalled in the U.S. Congress, small-business advocates have warned that the nation is on the precipice of widespread business failures and bankruptcies amid the Covid-19 pandemic. While it’s premature to say whether that will happen, a significant minority, 28%, indicated they may not make it through the next few months without additional government relief.
Among other findings in the survey, hospitality and accommodations businesses are the least confident in their longtime survival prospects, with 47% expecting to operate beyond six months if conditions don’t improve. The most optimistic respondents were in the property and real-estate industry, with 78% expecting to survive even under present conditions.
While the survey didn’t ask business owners about their political preferences, 58% indicated the presidential election would have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. However, only 22% said the election would significantly affect their own job security and only 28% said it would significantly affect their business’ financial security.
Among the new round of stimulus proposals that are in limbo in Congress is an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program that ended last month. The program offered low-rate government loans that are forgiven under certain conditions.
A second survey released Monday by the community revitalization group Main Street America suggests that most small businesses are loathe to take on additional debt to fund operations during the pandemic. More than 60% expect to tap existing sources of revenue rather than to seek a new bank loan, line of credit or government loan, according to the survey of more than 2,000 small-business owners.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>",South Korea's September exports seen growing for first time in seven months: Reuters poll,"By Joori Roh and Jihoon Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's exports likely grew for the first time in seven months in September due to more working days than a year earlier and heavy shipments of microchips as China's Huawei Technologies stockpiled ahead of U.S. sanctions, a Reuters poll showed.
Going forward, economists surveyed by Reuters expected South Korea's exports to suffer as major overseas markets have been hit by second waves of coronavirus, which will keep global demand subdued.
September shipments were seen rising 2.0% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of 18 economists, the first growth since February and rebounding sharply from a 10.1% plunge in August.
""Exports will likely post growth for the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak due to more working days, pre-orders ahead of Chuseok holiday and Huawei's chip stockpiling,"" said Park Sang-hyun, Hi Investment & Securities' chief economist.
There are 23 working days this month, 2.5 days more than a year earlier, as the Chuseok holiday fell in mid-September last year.
Economists have attributed export growth in preliminary data to stockpiling by Huawei ahead of U.S. sanctions which kicked in on Sept. 15.
Analysts also see local chip makers benefiting from the United States' new exports restrictions on China's biggest chip maker SMIC (HK:0981).
But economists worry that the virus resurgence at home and abroad may put a brake on exports recovery.
""The (exports) recovery ahead is unlikely to be smooth. The rebound in global demand will be buffeted by second waves of the coronavirus and the economic hangovers from dealing with the pandemic,"" said Alex Holmes, economist of Capital Economics.
South Korea on Friday said it would impose tighter restrictions during the Chuseok autumn holiday weeks when people traditionally reunite with families, after infections at a church and political rally in August sparked a new wave of coronavirus outbreaks.
It reported a total 23,661 cases and 406 deaths as of Sunday midnight, though the number of new cases at 50 was the lowest since the resurgence of the disease in August.
Meanwhile, 16 economists predicted industrial output in August would decline by a seasonally adjusted 1.5% month-on-month, compared with a 1.6% growth in July.
Fifteen economists also estimated consumer prices in September would rise a median 0.7% year-on-year, unchanged from the previous month.

1448,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>","China’s Rebound Lost Momentum in September, Early Data Show","(Bloomberg) -- China’s economic rebound showed signs of plateauing in September, weighed down by lackluster home and car sales, a weaker stock market and worsening business confidence.
That’s the assessment from the earliest available indicators, which showed China’s recovery is losing pace. The aggregate index combining eight indicators tracked by Bloomberg this month slipped into contraction, compared to accelerated expansion in August.
China has staged an uneven recovery, initially driven by strong industrial output yet with recent data showing signs that consumption has started to catch up. A strong and broad spurt in spending is needed for a more meaningful economic rebound.
New home sales in China’s four biggest cities slowed in the first three weeks of September, reversing August’s pickup. Small-business confidence eased marginally after rising for six straight months, while a gauge of expectations rose further into growth territory.
The pace of economic expansion moderated marginally for small businesses in September, despite continued recovery, according to Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which surveys more than 500 smaller firms each month. The growth momentum indicator eased from a month ago and the “current performance” reading retreated for the first time since March.
“This suggests that the recovery continued uninterrupted, despite signs that the V-shaped rebound is losing momentum,” according to economists Shen Lan and Ding Shuang, who published the results. “SMEs’ new orders slowed in September” and the pace of expansion of banks’ credit to SMEs also eased, they said.
Purchasing manager indexes due Wednesday are expected to show September manufacturing improved slightly while non-manufacturing moderated from August’s level.
Exports for smaller businesses remained resilient, according to Standard Chartered, with export-oriented SMEs performing better than domestically focused ones in the month.
The outlook for global trade remains more encouraging, with Korean exports in the first 20 days of September up 3.6% from a year earlier, the first rise in early trade data since March. Average daily shipments from South Korea, however, offered a less optimistic picture, falling by 9.8% as the period had two more working days compared with last year.
South Korea’s exports serve as a barometer of global trade as its companies are closely linked to global manufacturing-supply chains, and it releases data quickly.
Early Indicators
From July, Bloomberg has changed some of the components for the early look at China’s economy. It added home sales in the biggest four cities, weekly car sales and inventories of steel reinforcing, while removing iron-ore prices, sales manager sentiment and property-related stocks.
Bloomberg Economics generates the overall activity reading by aggregating a three-month weighted average of the monthly changes of eight indicators, which are based on business surveys or market prices.

China's recovery has been gaining momentum as pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports propel a rebound.
Industrial firm profits grew 19.1% year-on-year in August to 612.81 billion yuan ($89.8 billion), the statistics bureau said.
That compares with a 19.6% increase in July and is the fourth straight month of profit growth.
However, industrial firms' profits still face external pressures as rising tensions between Washington and Beijing cloud the global trade outlook.
Raw material manufacturing profits increased by 32.5% in August, up from 14.7% in July, according to Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau. This was driven in part by a rebound in the prices of international commodities such as crude oil and iron ore, he added.
Meanwhile, profits of the general equipment manufacturing sector notched up 37% in August on-year, with electrical machinery up by 13.3% over the same period.
Economic indicators in August, ranging from exports to producer prices and factory output, all pointed to a further pickup in the industrial sector.
However, factory activity grew at a slower pace with smaller firms facing sluggish market demand and financial strains.
The country has introduced a slew of measures to kick-start the economy, from tax and fee reductions to grace periods for the calling in of debt.
China's economy may stagnate if it fails to rise up the value chain, as it faces increasing competition from countries with advanced technologies and lower labour costs, economists warned.
Authorities have pledged to boost investment in strategic industries including core tech sectors such as 5G, artificial intelligence and semiconductors, and accelerate new material development to ensure stable supply chains.
For January-August, industrial firms' profits fell 4.4% from a year earlier to 3.72 trillion yuan, better than the 8.1% decrease in the first seven months. 
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.6% on-year at end-August, edging higher than the 6.5% at end-July.
Earnings at state-owned industrial firms were down 17% on an annual basis for the first eight months of the year, versus a 23.5% decline in the first seven months.
Private-sector profits fell 3.3% in January-August, narrowing from January-July’s 5.3% fall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in August and shipments raced to their highest level in nearly six years, suggesting a rebound in business spending on equipment was underway after a prolonged slump.
The show of confidence by businesses in the report from the Commerce Department on Friday also bolstered expectations for a sharp turnaround in economic activity in the third quarter, thanks to government money, after it was hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of the year. 
But fiscal aid is running out and new coronavirus cases are rising in the country, clouding the fourth-quarter picture. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week stressed the need for more fiscal stimulus, telling lawmakers on Thursday that it could make the difference between continued recovery and a much slower economic slog. Another rescue package appears unlikely before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
""The recovery in capex is not screeching to a halt,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Equipment spending will be a key contributor to the third-quarter's bounce back in GDP.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.8% last month to the highest level since July 2018. Data for July was revised up to show these so-called core capital goods orders increasing 2.5% instead of 1.9% as previously reported. Core capital goods orders are now above the their pre-pandemic level.
(Graphic: Core capital goods - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnvwjllypw/capgoods.png)
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast orders for these goods gaining 0.5% in August.
Core capital goods orders last month were boosted by increased demand for machinery, primary metals and computers and electronic products. But orders for fabricated metals products and electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
STRONG THIRD QUARTER EXPECTED
Shipments of core capital goods increased 1.5% last month to the highest level since September 2014. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. 
They advanced 2.8% in July. The two straight months of strong growth in shipments are likely to lift overall business investment from a deep hole in the third quarter.
Business investment tumbled at a record 26% annualized rate in the second quarter, with spending on equipment collapsing at an all-time pace of 35.9%. Investment in equipment has contracted for five straight quarters.
Economic activity rebounded sharply over the summer as businesses reopened after mandatory closures in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. 
Gross domestic product is expected to rebound at as much as a record 35% annualized rate in the third quarter after tumbling at a 31.7% rate in the April-June period, the worst performance since the government started keeping records in 1947.
But the economy is far from being out of the woods. Government loan programs to help businesses and income supplements for the tens of millions of unemployed have either lapsed or are close to expiring. 
New claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, businesses activity appeared to ebb in September and retail sales slowed in August. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday cut its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 3% rate from a 6% pace, citing ""lack of further fiscal support.""
""Decelerating from the reopening-induced, artificially high pace is something everyone is expecting,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania.
""The question is how fast do we slow? The September numbers will start providing some answers.""
For now the industrial side of the economy pressing ahead.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, rose 0.4% in August after jumping 11.7% in July. Durable goods orders were supported by a 0.5% rise in orders for transportation equipment, though demand for motor vehicles and defense aircraft eased.
(Graphic: Durable goods - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgpoajjrpd/durablegoods.png)
Orders for motor vehicles and parts dropped 4.0% after accelerating 21.7% in July. There were no orders for civilian aircraft reported for the second straight month in August. 
Boeing (N:BA) has struggled with cancellations as airlines grapple with sharply reduced demand for air travel because of the pandemic. The grounding of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets since March 2019 after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia has also weighed on the company. 

There was a continued drawdown of durable goods inventories last month, which bodes well for future production, though unfilled orders declined further.

LONDON (Reuters) - British public borrowing surged again in August to a record high, driven by huge outlays to combat the coronavirus pandemic, with the budget deficit so far this tax year overtaking its full-year peak during the global financial crisis.
The government has now borrowed 173.7 billion pounds ($221.8 billion) in the five months since the start of the financial year in April, outstripping the previous record of 157.7 billion pounds set in the 12 months ending March 2010.
Government budget forecasters have warned the deficit could hit 372 billion by the end of the tax year, raising borrowing as a share of gross domestic product to 18.9%, a level not seen since World War Two -- far above long-term sustainable rates.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Thursday that now was the time to focus on restoring growth, not reducing borrowing, but tough decisions would be needed in the longer term.
Despite this, he has cut support for people whose work remains jeopardised by the pandemic. 
Sunak said that from November the government would only subsidise ""viable"" jobs, where people were working at least a third of their normal hours, ending a programme where the government had paid up to 80% of furloughed employees' wages.
Many economists and trade unions fear this could lead to a big rise in unemployment for people in sectors such as hospitality, arts and entertainment that continue to bear the brunt of government coronavirus restrictions.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists said Sunak may need to reverse course and provide extra support.
""We think the risks to the deficit are to the upside, with the Chancellor likely to provide additional support if restrictions tighten further, or unemployment surprises,"" Jacob Nell and Bruna Skarica wrote.
Borrowing in August alone jumped to 35.9 billion pounds -- just below economists' average forecast of 38 billion in a Reuters poll -- while July's figure was revised down by 11 billion pounds to 15.4 billion pounds.
Britain's Office for National Statistics said the revisions partly reflected difficulties assigning government spending to specific months.
The Office for Budget Responsibility said borrowing so far this year was about 34 billion pounds lower than in its most recent forecast published on Sept. 8, largely due to a smaller decline in tax revenue than it had expected.
But it said government schemes allowing tax deferral, plus the general economic uncertainty, made it hard to know exactly how large the deficit would be at the end of the year.
Public sector net debt in August reached 2.024 trillion pounds, or 101.9% of GDP, the highest as a share of the economy since the 1960-61 financial year.
Britain suffered the biggest economic hit of any G7 economy from the coronavirus during the second quarter of this year, with output collapsing by 20%, and the Bank of England estimates third-quarter output will be around 7% below pre-crisis levels.
Despite heavy borrowing, the British government's interest costs on financial markets are near record lows, due to global gloom about the economic outlook and a long-term fall in interest rates.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is preparing to raise its budget deficit goals for this year and next and target public debt at around 156% of national output in 2021 because of the coronavirus crisis, two government sources told Reuters on Friday.
The Treasury will raise the target for the 2020 deficit to about 12.8% of gross domestic product from an 11.9% goal set a month ago. The 2020 debt should be near 160% of GDP, up from a previous estimate of 157.6%.
The new forecasts, still to be set as talks continue in the ruling coalition, will be published next week in the Treasury's Economic and Financial Document (DEF), which forms the framework of the 2021 budget.

It will pencil in growth of 6% for 2021, with the government expecting that a raft of expansionary measures to be financed by the European Union's Recovery Fund will boost economic output.
Rome will get some 209 billion euros by 2023 in cheap loans and grants from the Fund, designed to help the EU nations hardest hit by COVID-19.
The growth performance of heavily indebted Italy has consistently underperformed its European partners over the past two decades, with a long tradition of missed GDP targets.
In a paper published this month, the government said Europe-funded projects could help the country double its average growth rate, narrow its north-south divide and even increase its birth rate - one of the lowest in the world.

Industrial output is expected to have risen 1.5% in August from the previous month, the poll of 17 economists showed. It had jumped a revised 8.7% in July, the fastest on record, as domestic and global demand began to slowly recover from coronavirus-induced slumps.
""We expect broad gains in the production, including electronic parts and devices, and transport machineries,"" said Yusuke Shimoda, senior economist at Japan Research Institute.
""But the level of recovery in the factory output will still be about a half of losses caused by the coronavirus outbreak."" 
A business survey released this week showed factory activity continued to contract in September amid subdued demand, but new orders were falling at a much slower pace and manufacturers were more confident in the outlook.
The Reuters poll also found retail sales probably fell 3.5% in August from a year earlier, which would mark a sixth-straight month of decline, as fears of contracting the virus kept consumers at home.
The trade ministry will release both factory output and retail sales at 8:50 a.m. Japan time on Wednesday, September 30 (2350 GMT Tuesday).
Analysts forecast the jobless rate edged up to 3.0% in August from 2.9% in the previous month and the jobs-to-applicants ratio, or availability of jobs, likely worsened to 1.05 last month from 1.08 in July. 
""After the economic activity restarted from late May, some people are returning to work but the pace of recovery is slow,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Deflationary pressures are expected to persist. Tokyo's core consumer price (CPI) index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, likely fell 0.3% in September from a year earlier, the same rate of decline seen in August, the poll showed.
Weak energy prices such as electricity and gas weighed on consumer prices, analysts said. 
The government will publish Tokyo core CPI at 8:30 a.m. Japan time on Tuesday and jobs data on Friday.

1458,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 05:36PM ET</span>",China Buying Spree Revives Export Profits for Top Crop Traders,"(Bloomberg) -- The world’s largest agricultural commodity traders are making the most money in years exporting everything from soybeans to corn and wheat from American ports. And it’s mostly thanks to China.
The Asian nation has been on a buying spree, snapping up record amounts of American corn and holding at the start of the season the biggest soybean-import commitments for the time of year in almost three decades. The rush to guarantee loading space -- at a time when a key Gulf Coast terminal owned by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. is offline -- is sending export margins soaring.
The fat profits are a turnaround for an industry that had got used to thin margins and lower exports due to President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, the world’s top buyer of soybeans. With China still pledging to meet its commitments under the phase one trade deal, ADM expects record U.S. exports of agricultural products in the fourth quarter, helping boost earnings for its traditional agricultural services unit that had struggled for years.
“The big export sales of corn and soybeans on the books, of which half or more are to China, along with an ADM export terminal being closed for repair until early 2021 have combined to push Gulf elevation margins to close to the highest levels in the last five years,” said Thomas Meierotto, a commodity risk manager at Chicago-based brokerage R.J. O’Brien & Associates LLC.
Agriculture traders measure export profits by looking at the price difference for crops loaded onto ships at Gulf ports and the cost of a barge delivered to New Orleans. The so-called elevation margins -- which refer to elevators used to load the grain onto ships for export -- for soybeans are at the highest since at least 2016, according to Bloomberg calculations using Commodity3 data, which puts profits at more than 60 cents a bushel. Traders estimate it at about 50 cents.
Export profits are, in some cases, higher than in 2016, when the U.S. shipped a record 36 million tons of soybeans to China. That’s because the Asian nation is also buying a lot of corn, which competes for space in terminals across the country. China is also counting on more U.S. soybeans since Brazil has run out, and on American corn with Ukraine set for a smaller harvest this season.
“Exporters are using about every facility available at the Gulf, including Texas, as well as Pacific Northwest, the Great Lakes and the East Coast,” said John C. Baize, an independent consultant who advises the U.S. Soybean Export Council. “In addition, the mid-river barge to ship transfer terminals are being used for corn and soybeans. All are operating at near full capacity.”
China’s buying spree has sent soybean futures rallying to pre-trade war levels of more than $10 a bushel in Chicago, while gains in corn were more modest with supplies ample after the coronavirus slashed demand for ethanol. Still, high prices have already started to cool China’s appetite, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture reporting smaller daily sales.
“The next few weeks are looking pretty favorable for the export window to get these crops from the fields into the river, but just the total volumes that we’ve seen here have been very supportive to prices,” Erin Fitzpatrick, an analyst at Rabobank in St. Louis, said in a webinar this week. “These current price levels appear to be kind of slowing some of the demand.”
ADM is positive on the performance of its agriculture services unit as volumes and margins progressively improve through the year, with the fourth quarter expected to be the strongest, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said in a virtual event earlier this month. Agriculture giants including Cargill Inc. and  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd. are also set to benefit, as are Andersons Inc., CHS Inc. and Gavilon, all of which have export capacity from the U.S.
“I look back at where the previous high watermark was and that was 36 million tons for the year back in marketing year 2026-17,” said Jim Sutter, USSEC’s chief executive officer. “We seem to be setting ourselves up for a very similar year as that.”

The consumer sentiment index fell to 79.4 in September from 88.2 the previous month, the Bank of Korea said in a statement Friday. The 8.8 point decline was the largest since March when the country was reeling from the first wave of the pandemic.
South Korea’s economy showed signs of recovery at the start of the quarter, but the early momentum lost steam as daily virus case counts soared to hundreds in August. While the government has avoided imposing an economy-wide lockdown and instead opted for targeted restrictions, the flareup is still expected to have a significant impact on consumption and services.
The virus resurgence was a key factor when the central bank slashed its economic outlook for this year to a 1.3% contraction in August, from an earlier forecast for a 0.2% decline in May.
While South Korea has since managed to bring down daily caseloads to a little over hundred from the peak of more than 400 in August, health officials warn the upcoming Chuseok holiday could reignite infections with increased gatherings.
Among components of the headline index, households’ spending projections dragged most, followed by expectations for income and their assessment of the current state of the economy. Inflation expectations for the next year rose 0.1 percentage point to 1.9%.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market losing speed as fiscal stimulus wanes,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased last week, supporting views the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic was running out of steam amid diminishing government funding.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed 26 million people were on unemployment benefits in early September. The faltering labor market recovery and a recent rise in new coronavirus infections has piled pressure on Congress and the White House to come up with another rescue package. 
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday reiterated the need for more fiscal stimulus, telling lawmakers that it could make the difference between continued recovery and a much slower economic slog. New fiscal relief is looking increasingly unlikely before the Nov. 3 presidential election.
""The high level of joblessness shows that the country isn't out of the woods yet and it won't be if the pleading of Fed officials for more stimulus isn't heard by government officials down in Washington,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The economy is running on empty."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 870,000 for the week ended Sept. 19. Data for the prior week was revised to show 6,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 840,000 applications in the latest week. 
Unadjusted claims increased 28,527 to 824,542 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted claims number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis.
Six months after the pandemic started in the United States, jobless claims remain above their 665,000 peak during the 2007-09 Great Recession, though applications have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March. 
While the reopening of businesses in May boosted activity, demand in the vast services sector has remained lackluster, keeping layoffs elevated. Job cuts have also spread to industries such as financial services and technology that were not initially impacted by the mandated business closures in mid-March because of insufficient demand.
A total 630,080 applications were received for the government-funded pandemic unemployment assistance last week. 
The PUA is for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs. PUA applications could fall in the coming weeks after California last Saturday suspended the filing of new claims for two weeks to combat fraud. 
Altogether, 1.5 million people filed claims last week.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar was lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
STALLED PROGRESS
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 167,000 to 12.58 million in the week ending Sept. 12. 
Economists believe the so-called continuing claims are declining partly as people exhaust their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to 26 weeks in most states. 
Indeed, just under one million workers exhausted their first six months of state unemployment benefits in August. At least 1.6 million workers filed for extended unemployment benefits in the week ending Sept. 5, up 104,479 from the prior week.
The continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for September's unemployment rate. The decline in mid-September implied a further decrease in the jobless rate from 8.4% in August.
""Only faster progress against the virus itself will assuage the unemployment struggles of so many workers in fields like entertainment who can't return to their jobs until social distancing restrictions are relaxed ,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York. 
The Fed has cut interest rates to near zero and vowed to keep borrowing costs low for a while, and has also been pumping money into the economy. Government money to help businesses has virtually dried up. Tens of thousands of airline workers are facing layoffs or furloughs next month. 
A $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement ended in July and was replaced with a $300 weekly subsidy, whose funding is already running out. 
The ebbing fiscal stimulus is already restraining the economy after activity rebounded sharply over the summer. Gross domestic product is expected to rebound at as much as a record 35% annualized rate in the third quarter after tumbling at a 31.7% rate in the April-June period, the worst performance since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
But retail sales and production at factories moderated in August. Business activity cooled in September, reports have shown. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) on Wednesday cut its fourth-quarter GDP growth estimate to a 3% rate from a 6% pace, citing ""lack of further fiscal support.""

Despite the economy's fading fortunes, the housing market continues to shine, with new home sales near a 14-year high in August.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Foot traffic to U.S. restaurants and stores showed little improvement last week, high frequency data show, and signs emerged of deepening stress for small businesses as economists worry the recovery from coronavirus lockdowns continues to slow.
After steady growth over the summer, estimates of seated diners at restaurants maintained by booking site OpenTable https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry fell for the second week. They remain at about 60% of levels in early March before a national state of emergency was declared to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
(Graphic: Retail in real time - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPEN/yzdvxxyzlvx/chart.png)
Employee records on 55,000 small businesses maintained by Homebase https://joinhomebase.com/data showed the number of people working declined for a second week in a row. 
Data from cellphone tracking firm Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard shows that the gradual return to restaurants, gyms and other ""close contact"" businesses has largely stalled following improvement over the summer. 
(Graphic: Employment in real time - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPENING/gjnvwxamxpw/chart.png)
Many U.S. businesses tapped federal programs for help early in the pandemic, but with the health crisis now likely to extend into next year, the stress may be too much.
Recent surveys from small business networking group Alignable and online review site  Yelp  (NYSE:YELP) both suggested a looming jump in small firm failures. 
""The impact has been too deep for too long. And it's taking its toll,"" Alignable spokesman Chuck Casto said, after the group's poll of more than 6,300 small businesses, released Wednesday, found more then 40% expect they won't earn enough revenue through the end of the year to stay in business.
That finding is consistent with recent U.S. Census surveys of small businesses showing a decline in September in the percentage of firms that had enough cash on hand for more than a month of operation. 
The fate of the United States' roughly 6 million small businesses will shape the broader contours of the recovery and the economy that emerges after the pandemic.
It will be particularly critical to sustain job growth. U.S. firms with fewer than 500 workers employed around 60 million as of 2017, according to Census data.
Some economic policymakers worry that the larger-than-expected job gains from May through August will mark the high point of the recovery. The economy clawed back about half of the 22 million positions lost in the spring's pandemic shut down, but few expect that pace to continue. Jobless claims unexpectedly increased https://ca.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-idCAKCN26F249 for the week ending Sept. 19, Labor Department data released Thursday show. 
After hitting a pandemic-era high of 14.7% in April, the unemployment rate fell to 8.4% in August. But at the most recent Federal Reserve meeting even the most optimistic policymaker projected slower improvement, with the rate still 6.5% by year's end. The median projection called for less than a percentage point improvement from here. 
New weekly job postings aggregated by economic consulting firm Chmura http://www.chmuraecon.com/blog from online employment firms and company websites have remained at roughly 90% of their pre-pandemic level in recent weeks - a sign of steady but not surging momentum in hiring.
By some high frequency measures, however, the economic rebound continues apace. Data from cellphone tracking firm Safegraph https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns showed foot traffic at retail locations overall is near its March level. 
Sectors including manufacturing and housing have made steady progress. Data from time management firm UKG https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/update-us-workforce-activity showed that shifts worked across a variety of industries grew an average of 1.1% weekly so far in September after that figure dipped as low as 0.5% in August. 
But that data also showed a divided recovery. Shifts worked at manufacturing firms for the week ending Sept. 20 were just 1% below the average from January through March. Retail firms were down by 10%. 
Larger firms are ""starting to dramatically outpace smaller businesses,"" in terms of labor pickup, said Dave Gilbertson, vice president of strategy and operations at UKG, with firms above 5,000 workers adding shifts at a rate of 3% per week, while growth among firms with fewer than 100 employees was less than 1%.
Measures of the broader national recovery have shown no clear direction for several weeks. An Oxford http://blog.oxfordeconomics.com/topic/recovery-tracker economics index combining health, economic and social data for the last four weeks has remained at about 80% of January's level. 
(Graphic: Oxford Economics Recovery Index - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/rlgpdlnyepo/chart.png)

As federal unemployment and other benefits start to diminish, ""the situation isn't sustainable without stronger gains in employment,"" said Oxford chief economist Gregory Daco.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales rose 4.8% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.011 million units last month, the highest level since September 2006. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. 
July's sales pace was revised upward to 965,000 units from the previously reported 901,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 14% of housing market sales, slipping 1% to a rate of 895,000-units.
The report followed on the heels of data this week showing sales of previously owned homes near a 14-year high in August.
The housing market is being powered by record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas in search of more spacious accommodation as many people work from home. Unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers in the services sector, who are typically young and renters.
In August, new home sales rose 5.0% in the Northeast. They jumped 13.4% in the South, which accounts for the bulk of transactions. But sales fell 1.7% in the West and decreased 21.4% in the Midwest. The median new house price fell 4.3% to $312,800 in August from a year ago. New home sales last month were concentrated in the $200,000 to $499,000 price range.

There were 282,000 new homes on the market last month, down from 291,000 in July. At August's sales pace it would take 3.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 3.6 months in July. About 71% of the homes sold last month were either under construction or yet to be built.

BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Business morale in Germany and France improved for the fifth month in a row in September, boosting hopes that the euro zone's two biggest economies had enjoyed a solid recovery from the coronavirus shock suffered in the first half of the year.
The surveys, published on Thursday by Germany's Ifo institute and France's statistics office, suggested that both countries are set for strong growth in the third quarter, though the outlook is clouded by rising infections and new restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Ifo institute said its business climate index rose to 93.4 from a downwardly revised 92.5 in August. That was the highest reading since February, when the index stood at 95.9.
""The German economy is stabilizing despite rising infection numbers,"" Ifo President Clemens Fuest said.
The German economy contracted by 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investments and trade collapsed at the height of the pandemic. The government has since March unleashed an array of rescue and stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing, to cushion the impact.
In a sign that Berlin's response to the crisis seems to be paying off, business morale in manufacturing improved considerably on upbeat export expectations, the survey showed.
In the service sector, however, sentiment fell for the first time in five months as morale in tourism and hospitality deteriorated due to rising infections in recent weeks.
For the third quarter, Ifo now expects the German economy to grow by 6.6% on the quarter and then growth to slow to 2.8% in the fourth quarter, Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said.
The survey shows that the easy part of the recovery is over. Infections are on the rise in many countries that are important trading partners for German manufacturers, KfW chief economist Fritzi Koehler-Geib said.
In France, the business confidence index rose to 92 from August's 90, reaching its highest level since February, before France went into a two-month lockdown to contain the outbreak, plunging the economy deep into recession.
The index for the industrial sector improved particularly sharply, jumping to 96 from 92, exceeding the average expectations in a Reuters poll for a reading of 95. The index for the bigger services sector rose to 95 from 93.
The improvement comes even though the French government has had no choice but to increase restrictions on gatherings in the face of a surge in new COVID-19 cases to record levels.

The data also contrasted with surveys from IHS Markit, which showed that private sector activity in Germany and France slowed in September on weaker-than-expected services activity.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Months after China brought its coronavirus epidemic under control, its consumers are slowly opening their wallets again - but the hard days of lockdowns still weigh on many shellshocked lower-income households, who prefer to hold on to their cash.
While China's recovery from a record first quarter contraction is well ahead of most other countries, it has been uneven. Lingering weakness in consumption could complicate President Xi Jinping's push to curb the country's dependence on volatile overseas markets.
Factories rebounded relatively quickly from paralysing lockdowns, but consumer confidence has picked up only gradually in the world's second-largest economy.
It took until August before retail sales finally returned to growth, rising 0.5% on-year. Sales for the first eight months were 8.6% lower than the same period last year.
But while spending on luxury goods like Prada (OTC:PRDSY) bags (HK:1913) quickly shook off the virus shock, consumption of daily necessities and services is recovering more slowly. Extra caution from lower-income households is a key reason why, say analysts.
""We live on savings but it's difficult, we tried to buy only the necessities,"" said Zhou Ran, a self-employed decorator in central Henan's Xinxiang city who couldn't work for four months earlier this year amid lockdowns. 
Sales of clothing and shoes remain down 15% over the first eight months, while fuel and other petroleum product sales are down 17.3%. Incomes from food and beverage sales fell over 26% in this period.
SHOCKED SPENDERS 
Analysts will be closely watching data and company sales reports from China's ""Golden Week"" holidays on Oct. 1-8 to gauge how quickly consumers' mood is improving.
Though Zhou returned to work in May, business was hard to find. ""Many people prefer to keep cash for now so they delay renovations,"" he said. 
""It is difficult for everyone this year,"" said Zhou, whose wife takes care of their three children and doesn't have an income.
A quarterly report issued jointly by the research arm of Alibaba-backed Ant Group and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics showed the vulnerability of low income families to the epidemic. 
Most households with annual incomes below 100,000 yuan ($14,800) reported their wealth declined in the first and second quarters. Those with incomes above 300,000 yuan reported consistent gains.
""Higher-income households have probably built up savings, because of the forced reduction in consumption during lockdown, and could now be ready for a spending spree,"" said Wei He, an analyst at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, in a note.
""It is lower-income households that face a longer slog of normalizing their finances,"" he said. 
JD (NASDAQ:JD).com data shows that consumption growth in lower-tier cities and low-income groups was weaker than in major cities and high-income groups in June, reversing the usual trend, according to Shen Jianguang, chief economist at JD Digits, the Chinese e-commerce giant's fintech arm.
This is likely because the small and medium-sized enterprises which employ many lower-income people were affected more by the epidemic, Shen said in an article published August. 
The impact on consumption could be considerable. Some 600 million Chinese people earn a monthly income of barely 1,000 yuan, according to Premier Li Keqiang, speaking in May. That would be over 40% of the country's population. 
Beijing has issued a slew of policies to stabilize jobs and support spending over the last months. Local authorities and companies have, for instance, handed out billions of yuan in shopping vouchers.
ANY PORT IN A STORM
To be sure, China's recovery, as imbalanced as it is, is still a bright spot in global consumption as other major economies battle a second wave of infections and in some cases impose fresh curbs on activity. 
Many in China's vast export-oriented sector have turned to the domestic market as foreign orders dry up, with enthusiastic government support.
An app from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Holding Group Ltd which helps manufacturing suppliers sell directly to domestic consumers has seen 1.2 million companies sign up since its launch in March. Nearly half were export-focused previously, according to an Alibaba spokesperson.
Domestic orders now make up 40% of total orders for Tu Xinye, the manager of a company that makes toothbrushes in southern Jiangsu province. 
That's up from just 10% in the past, and overall sales volume has returned to 90% of pre-COVID levels, he said. 
But while Chinese consumers made up for the company's shrinking overseas orders this year, they also create new challenges, said Tu.
Competition is fiercer at home than in the bigger ""blue ocean"" export market, and Chinese buyers also like different kinds of toothbrushes - with softer bristles and smaller handles.
Tu's company's relative success has been an outlier in his town. Many smaller companies there have collapsed, and Tu is now in the process of acquiring a competitor.

""Times of crisis are also times when there's some economic reshuffling,"" he said.

The majority of firms are recovering far more slowly than those in wealthier areas around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, said a report from China Beige Book International (CBB).
While revenue and profits for the third quarter saw steep declines year-on-year across China, many interior provinces also saw output, domestic orders, and sales prices falling from the second quarter as well, according to a quarterly survey of thousands of Chinese firms by the U.S.-based consultancy.
For instance, sales revenues increased 41% quarter-on-quarter for Shanghai and the wealthy eastern provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu, but fell by 10% in the more remote western regions of Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang, it said.
""For the corporate elite – large firms and those based in the Big 3 coastal regions – the economy is accelerating ... But the rest of China – most firms in most regions – are seeing a far more muted recovery,"" said Derek Scissors, chief economist at CBB, in comments issued with the survey.
In August, China's industrial output accelerated the most in eight months, while retail sales grew for the first time this year, suggesting the economic recovery is gathering pace as demand starts to improve more broadly from the coronavirus crisis.
Regional divergences were also visible in credit, according to the consultancy, with a far higher proportion of firms in the wealthy areas around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong accessing capital.
""Borrowing levels stayed flat or fell outright in 4 of 5 non-coastal regions,"" it said in the report.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's unemployment rate jumped to 13.1% in the second quarter of the year as the country was swiped by the coronavirus pandemic, the official statistics agency said on Wednesday, the highest since 2004 and up from 10.4% in the previous quarter.
Argentina imposed a strict lockdown in mid-March, hitting an already shaky economy in recession since 2018 and leaving many businesses struggling to survive. The country now has over 650,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19.
""The (unemployment) numbers largely reflect the impact on labor market dynamics from the COVID-19 pandemic and from the restrictions on certain activities and movement,"" Argentina's INDEC statistics body said in a report.
The agency said the sectors hardest hit included construction, hotels and restaurants and domestic services.

The South American grains producer, which is just emerging from default on its foreign debt, needs to revive its economy and get people back to work to stave off a sharp increase in poverty and to refill depleted government coffers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business activity cooled in September, with gains at factories offset by a retreat at services industries, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy as the third quarter draws to a close and COVID-19 lingers.
The economy's recovery from the pandemic recession is losing speed as government financial help to businesses and the unemployed dries up. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers on Wednesday that Congress and the U.S. central bank needed to remain focused on supporting the recovery.
""We need to stay with it ... the recovery will go faster if there is support coming both from Congress and the Fed,"" Powell said.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, slipped to a reading of 54.4 this month from 54.6 in August. A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output. Though the private sector continues to expand, this month's dip in the index was in line with views that the economy's momentum was ebbing. 
Gross domestic product is expected to rebound at as much as a record 32% annualized rate in the third quarter after tumbling at a 31.7% rate in the April-June period, the worst performance since the government started keeping records in 1947. 
The coronavirus crisis wiped out more than five years of growth, and economists are calling for another aid package from the government to help the fragile recovery. The economy slipped into recession in February. 
""The question now turns to whether the economy's strong performance can be sustained into the fourth quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, noting that the uncertainty over the Nov. 3 presidential election had also risen. ""Risks therefore seem tilted to the downside for the coming months, as businesses await clarity with respect to both the path of the pandemic and the election.""
Moderation in business activity was not confined to the United States. Euro zone business growth ground to a halt this month amid a renewed downturn in the dominant services sector, a separate survey from IHS Markit showed on Wednesday.
Six months after the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States, coronavirus cases remain high, with the death toll in the country exceeding 200,000 on Tuesday - by far the highest number of any nation.
The survey's services sector flash PMI fell to 54.6 this month from a reading of 55.0 in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 54.7 this month for the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. The services industry has been hardest hit by the virus and remains below its pre-pandemic level. 
A measure of service industry employment slipped this month.
In contrast, manufacturing firms signaled an acceleration in activity. The flash manufacturing PMI increased to 53.5 this month from 53.1 in August. Economists had forecast the index for the sector, which accounts for 11% of the economy, holding at 53.1 this month. A measure of new orders received by factories edged down to a reading of 54 from 54.1 in August.
""The shift from a few months with large increases across PMI components to more mixed results looks broadly consistent with many economic indicators that point to a loss of momentum lately following a period with widespread and robust gains as the economy started recovering from the virus-related shock,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
STRONG HOUSING MARKET
While the overall economy is showing signs of slowing, the housing market is pressing ahead, driven by historically low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas in search of more spacious accommodation as many people work from home. 
The strong demand for housing has not been matched by an increase in supply, boosting house price inflation. A separate report on Wednesday showed the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 1.0% in July after a similar gain in June. House prices jumped 6.5% on a year-on-year basis in July. That was the biggest annual gain since June 2018 and followed a 5.8% increase in June.
The FHFA's index is calculated by using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages sold to or guaranteed by mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). A report from the National Association of Realtors on Tuesday showed house prices surged 11.4% in August from a year ago.
""We expect demand from buyers fleeing urban areas to taper off, while the weakening recovery in the labor market will pose headwinds to housing activity,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 

""Sparse inventory, particularly of existing homes, will keep a solid floor under home prices even if demand softens from its recent level.""

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",UK's post-lockdown recovery loses steam as household demand weakens,"By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's recovery from the coronavirus lockdown lost some momentum this month, a business survey showed, as consumer-facing sectors suffered from the end of a government subsidy to support restaurants and more general COVID-related worries.
The IHS Markit/CIPS flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dropped to a three-month low of 55.7 in September after hitting a six-year high of 59.1 in August, a slightly larger drop than economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.
The preliminary survey, published on Wednesday, still showed strong growth in Britain's services and manufacturing sectors, but reflected a slowdown in new orders and the weakest confidence about future output since May.
British gross domestic product fell more than 20% during the second quarter, the biggest drop of any G7 economy, and the Bank of England expects third-quarter output to be around 7% below its level before the crisis.
""The drop in the (PMI) suggests that the recovery has already started to flatten out,"" said economist Thomas Pugh at Capital Economics.
British businesses performed better than those in the euro zone, where PMI data on Wednesday showed growth ground to a halt in September due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Britons on Tuesday to work from home where possible and ordered restaurants and bars to close early to tackle a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19, with new restrictions lasting probably six months.
""Reinstating restrictions on business opening hours and encouraging people to work from home again could cause the recovery to stall completely in Q4,"" Pugh said. 
Businesses in the survey said they were reducing staff numbers for a seventh consecutive month -- the longest such run since 2010 and one which bodes poorly for many workers when government job support measures expire at the end of next month.
Britain's central bank forecast last month that unemployment would jump to 7.5% in the final three months of this year from 4.1% during the three months to July.
The change in the government's approach, less than a month after it was offering half-price incentives for people to dine in restaurants and discouraging working from home, comes after a big rise in new COVID-19 cases, also seen elsewhere in Europe.
Testing capacity has come under strain since schools in England reopened at the start of September.
IHS Markit said the weakening in growth was concentrated in sectors that relied on consumer demand, and services activity slowed more than manufacturing.

""The restaurant sector in particular saw demand fall sharply as the Eat Out to Help Out scheme was withdrawn,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 48.5 in September from 51.6 in August, falling short of expectations for 51.9 in a Reuters poll of economists.
That brought the index below the 50-point threshold demarcating growth in activity from a contraction and was the lowest since May, when France emerged from a two-month coronavirus lockdown that plunged the economy into recession.
France has seen new infections spiral higher in recent weeks to record levels, leading to the imposition of some new restrictions to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus and reduce the number of intensive care admissions.
""The rise in case numbers has been accompanied by fresh restrictions, but has also caused hesitancy among businesses due to fears of a second round of temporary business closures,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr said.
""For now, at least, firms remain optimistic towards the year ahead outlook, but should the current trajectory of infection rates persist, that confidence is likely be tested in the coming months.""
The survey showed confidence falling in particular in the services sector, where a flash PMI fell to 47.5 from 51.5 in August, hitting the lowest level since May and falling short of expectations for a stable reading at 51.5.

In contrast, the smaller manufacturing sector saw a slight improvement, with its index rising to 50.9 from 49.8, slightly exceeding expectations on average for a reading of 50.5.

The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, edged up to -1.6 heading into October from an upwardly revised -1.7 in the previous month.
The reading missed a Reuters forecast for an increase to -1.0 and followed an unexpected drop in the previous month.
GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl said the German consumer climate had stabilized despite a recent rise in new coronavirus infections and the growing risk of another round of lockdown measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It seems as if the massive stimulus packages for consumers and companies are the right measures to help Germany get out of the worst recession in post-war history,"" Buerkl said.
Since March, Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government has implemented an unprecedented array of stimulus measures, financed with record new borrowing of some 218 billion euros ($256.15 billion), to cushion the impact of the pandemic.

But Buerkl added that a further improvement in consumer morale was depending on the development of the pandemic and the labour market.

While still remaining in contraction, other indicators in the manufacturing survey such as new orders and suppliers' delivery times saw their slowest pace of declines since January.
Other positive signs in the survey included manufacturers' views on future output, which rose to a more than two year high.

BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - Business sentiment among Asian firms rebounded in the third quarter as easing coronavirus restrictions lifted sales but lingering uncertainty over the pandemic thwarted a return to business-as-usual, a Thomson Reuters/INSEAD survey showed.
Asian firms' outlook for the next six months tracked by the Thomson Reuters/INSEAD Asian Business Sentiment Index <.TRIABS>  jumped to 53 in the third quarter from an 11-year low of 35 in the second, according to the survey of 103 companies across 11 Asia-Pacific countries.
It was also higher than the 50-point mark, which indicates a positive outlook.
The survey comes as the easing of coronavirus restrictions across Asia has reduced pressure on hard-hit economies, though the experience has varied across the region, with some still in recession and others, like China, seeing a steady recovery.
More than two-thirds of the companies polled said they saw the pandemic, or a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases, as a top risk. About 14% said a global recession was their biggest concern, while the rest flagged uncertainty over the upcoming U.S. election in November and other risks.
""We're recovering with a large dose of uncertainty,"" said Antonio Fatas, an economics professor at global business school INSEAD in Singapore.
""If it was just because of Asia, I think the numbers would be more positive but the reality is the world is not just Asia,"" he said, pointing to greater uncertainty in Europe and the United States.
The United States has reported the greatest number of COVID-19 fatalities, while rising numbers in Europe are now threatening to shut down parts of the continent again.
Some 28% of companies in the third quarter were positive about their outlook, the survey showed, up sharply from 7.6% in the second quarter. About 60% of the firms polled said they did not hire or lay off people this quarter, in contrast to the second quarter's survey in which 63% said they had cut jobs. 
Companies polled included Australia-listed Oil Search (AX:OSH), Indian motorcycle maker  Hero MotoCorp  (NS:HROM) and Japanese car maker Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269).
The survey was conducted between Aug. 31 and Sept. 14.
CHINA OPTIMISM
While countries in Asia have had mixed success in containing the coronavirus and its fallout on their economies, the Asian Development Bank expects output in the region to shrink for the first time in nearly six decades this year. 
China, where the coronavirus was first detected, has largely managed to contain its spread and South Korea and Japan have kept case numbers relatively low by global standards despite all three countries seeing a second wave of infections. 
But elsewhere in the region the outbreak is worsening. India, for instance, has reported the second-highest number of cases globally.
Indeed, some investors are shunning Asia's riskier, high-yielding markets, despite the ample liquidity pumped into the financial system by central banks globally this year.
Satish Shankar, the Asia-Pacific managing partner of business consultancy Bain & Company, said many companies in the region would ""need to fundamentally transform their business models"" to survive.
But he added that Asia's economic rebound would be ""strongly linked"" to the recovery in the Chinese economy.
China expanded 3.2% in the second quarter, and looks set to grow this year.
Some China-based firms in the survey said the upcoming U.S. election was their primary worry alongside COVID-19.
The U.S. government is threatening to delist Chinese companies that do not meet U.S. accounting standards while Washington has cracked down on Chinese tech firms amid worsening relations between the world's two largest economies.
Grant Pan, chief financial officer of Chinese wealth manager Noah Holdings (N:NOAH), which is listed in the United States, said the firm was looking at ""possible alternatives as a safety net, including the Hong Kong and Chinese capital market"". Noah Holdings was among the companies surveyed.

Citigroup concluded the costs of racism are greater than did a 2019 McKinsey study, which estimated that the racial wealth gap would cost the U.S. economy $1.5 trillion through 2028, but both agree the status quo is a drag on growth.
“What this report underscores is that this tariff is levied on us all, and particularly in the U.S., that cost has a real and tangible impact on our country’s economic output,” Citigroup Vice Chairman Raymond J.

1481,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",U.S. existing home sales approach 14-year high; prices scale record peak,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales surged to their highest level in nearly 14 years in August as the housing market continued to outperform the overall economy, but record high home prices could squeeze first-time buyers out of the market.
The report from the National Association of Realtors confirmed home sales had recovered after slumping when the economy almost ground to a halt as businesses were shuttered in mid-March in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
Demand for housing is being fueled by record-low mortgage rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low-density areas in search of more spacious accommodation as many people work from home. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a congressional panel on Tuesday that the economy has shown ""marked improvement"" since plunging into recession in February, though the path ahead remains uncertain.
""The housing market has continued its remarkable recovery amidst an otherwise fraught economy that has been battered by the pandemic,"" said John Pataky, executive vice president at TIAA Bank in Jacksonville, Florida. 
""However, we should continue to be paranoid about the sustainability of sales. With lack of housing supply, there is an upward pressure on home prices which threatens to detract the benefits accrued from low mortgage rates."" 
  Existing home sales increased 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 million units last month, the highest level since December 2006. August's increase in homes sales, which marked three straight months of gains, was in line with economists' expectations.
The median existing house price jumped 11.4% from a year ago to a record $310,600 in August. Sales last month were concentrated in the $250,000 to $1 million and over price range, with transactions below the $250,000 price band down sharply.
Existing home sales, which account for the bulk of U.S. home sales, jumped 10.5% on a year-on-year basis in August. 
The PHLX housing index increased more than 1.5%, outpacing a broadly firmer U.S. stock market. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were down.
TIGHT INVENTORY
Though the coronavirus crisis has left nearly 30 million people on unemployment benefits, joblessness has disproportionately affected low-wage workers in the services sector, who are typically young and renters.
Home sales rose in all four regions last month. Demand for housing was skewed toward single-family homes as people sought larger spaces for home offices and schooling. The NAR reckons the migration to suburbs from city centers could become permanent even if a vaccine is developed for the respiratory illness.
Single-family home sales advanced 1.7% in August. While multi-family home sales increased 8.6%, they accounted for 10.5% of sales, down from the 12% that is considered the norm for the housing market. 
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.87%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). A persistent shortage of homes for sale and August's double-digit house price inflation growth are red flags.
The shortage is concentrated in the single-family housing segment. Though single-family builders' confidence hit a record high this month and permits for single-family home construction jumped in August to their highest level since May 2007, the supply squeeze is unlikely to ease as fires in the West have boosted lumber prices. 
There were 1.49 million previously owned homes on the market in August, down 18.6% from a year ago. At August's sales pace, it would take 3.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.1 months in July and 4.0 months a year ago. 
A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.
""The 11% gain in prices is far above income growth and threatens overall affordability especially for first-time buyers,"" said Joel Kan an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington. ""It's clear that more inventory is needed to keep home prices from rising too quickly."" 
Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 22 days, matching July, but down from 31 days in August 2019. Sixty-nine percent of homes sold in August were on the market for less than a month. According to the NAR, realtors were reporting multiple bids for houses on the market.

First-time buyers accounted for 33% of sales in August, down from 34% in July 2020, but up from 31% in August 2019. Individual investors or second-home buyers, who account for many cash sales, bought 14% of homes in August. All-cash sales accounted for 18% of transactions.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Europe appears to have weathered a pandemic-induced recession better than many feared, a slew of indicators suggested on Tuesday, but prospects for a second wave of infections and a hard Brexit are once again raising talk of more stimulus.
Having shrunk by over a tenth last quarter, the euro zone economy is quickly regaining strength on the back of relatively resilient consumption, supported by job subsidy schemes, tax cuts and lavish stimulus from the European Central Bank. 
Indeed, consumer confidence in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose to -13.9 this month from -14.7 in August, the European Commission said, a reading below its long-term trend but easily beating market expectations.
Adding to the positive news, the Ifo Institute upgraded its forecast for Germany, expecting GDP in the euro zone's biggest economy to shrink 5.2% this year, a big improvement on its last projection for a 6.7% drop or the Bundesbank's 7.1% forecast.
The figures suggest that unprecedented fiscal and monetary support have insulated the bloc from an unprecedented recession and households began to spend once again as most restrictions were lifted during the summer months.
Unemployment in the region has barely risen compared to some other major economies and, at 7.9%, has still not moved far from the more than 10-year low of 7.2% hit earlier this year.
Germany's HDE retail association now expects nominal sales to grow by 1.5% this year, a sharp upward revision from its previous estimate for a 4% drop, helped by a surge in online sales and stimulus measures that have included a temporary VAT cut and cash handouts for parents.
UNSUSTAINABLE? 
But the good news may be unsustainable. 
Investors are growing increasingly worried about surging coronavirus infections in countries like France and Spain, increasing the risk of lockdowns, a factor not captured by Tuesday's indicators. 
""We doubt this (confidence rise) will be sustained,"" Melanie Debono at Capital Economic said in a note. ""Further restrictions are being imposed and look set to cause consumer confidence, and perhaps household spending, to drop back in the fourth quarter.""
Worries over a hard Brexit merely compound the troubles and European stocks tumbled this week as markets are now pricing a more protracted recovery with more frequent interruptions. 
Indeed, many euro zone countries have reintroduced travel restrictions, forcing airlines to scale back passenger services after a relatively quick run up over the summer.
But most governments appear keen to avoid the type of hard lockdowns seen in early spring and instead opt for localised, targeted measures that allow people to maintain ordinary activities as much as possible. 
Mortality is also not following the surge in infections, supporting government efforts to limit disruptions.
Still, the outlook is sufficiently murky for the ECB to make the clearest case yet for even more stimulus, perhaps as soon as the fourth quarter. 
""Faced with such a sizeable downward skew (in risks), there is a strong case for our reaction function to be asymmetric, as the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising,"" ECB board member Fabio Panetta said.
He added that while the ECB has done a lot, the inflation outlook is not yet satisfactory as price growth is ""uncomfortably"" below the ECB's aim of close to 2%.

""If we encounter shocks that compress demand and pose additional threats to price stability, our reaction function is clearly spelled out: a policy response is necessary and forthcoming,"" he said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's economy likely contracted around 20% year-on-year in the second quarter of the year, hit by the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide lockdown imposed in March, economists polled by Reuters estimated ahead of the official data release on Tuesday.
That would be the worst quarter since at least the 1980s, according to official government data, and a sharper drop than any period during Argentina's major economic crisis in 2002, when the steepest quarterly fall was 16.3%.
The South American grains producer, in recession since 2018 and just emerging from default on its sovereign debt, has been hit hard by the pandemic despite a tough early lockdown. It has over 640,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and nearly 13,500 deaths.
The government imposed the lockdown on March 20, and while it has been eased it remains in place until at least Oct. 11, with Argentina still at its peak in terms of daily case numbers. The country recorded over 400 deaths in 24 hours on Monday.
""The key is in lockdown; restriction on supply and the blow it had on demand pummeled economic activity in the second quarter of 2020,"" said consultancy Ecolatina.
A Reuters poll of 14 local and foreign analysts gave a forecast for a 19.9% average contraction for the April-June period and a median estimate of a 19.6% drop. Predictions ranged from drops of 19.4% to a steepest 21.1% fall.
""The strong isolation restrictions imposed from the second half of March and that lasted until August had a significant economic cost for the entire country,"" said economist Natalia Motyl, from consultancy Libertad y Progreso.
Motyl added that services, construction and manufacturing had been the hardest hit, while the important farm export sector had been less affected by the lockdown, that had taken a hit from global commodities prices.
Argentina's economy, which declined 5.4% in the first quarter of the year, is estimated to contract around 12% this year, according to a central bank poll and government forecasts.

LONDON (Reuters) - British manufacturers reported the sharpest drop in orders for three months in September and said they expected production to remain weak for the remainder of the year due to the impact of COVID-19 and Brexit worries.
The Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) monthly industrial order book balance fell to -48 in September from -44 in August, bucking expectations in a Reuters poll of economists for a small improvement and remaining well below its long-run average.
""As manufacturing firms continue to battle against headwinds from a resurgence of the virus, weak global demand and uncertainty over our trading relationships, the government must step up its support,"" CBI economist Anna Leach said.
Britain's government is tightening coronavirus restrictions - including bringing in early closing for pubs and restaurants - and has reversed calls employees to return to work in offices.
Many businesses are also concerned about the end of a job support scheme next month that has paid them to keep staff on furlough until demand picks up.
""The recovery in the manufacturing sector appears to be losing momentum. Strong growth in output over the summer likely was partly due to firms shifting work backlogs that had amassed during the lockdown,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at consultants Pantheon Macroeconomics.
The CBI said it wanted a replacement for the furlough programme, as well as progress on a trade deal with the European Union before transition arrangements end at the end of the year.
""Firms across the country are facing considerable uncertainty as the end of the Job Retention Scheme nears, and concerns about the potential for a no-deal Brexit have escalated as negotiations remain in stalemate,"" said Tom Crotty, group director of chemicals and industrial firm INEOS.
The CBI data showed manufacturers were slightly less negative about the outlook for production over the next three months, but still expected it to fall.

The most recent official data showed factory output expanded by 6.3% in July but was 9.4% lower than in July 2019.

Some 10.5% of consumers surveyed said they had become unemployed between March and July of this year, up from 2.8% in July 2019 and reaching a series high for the survey, which started in March 2014. The average expected likelihood of becoming unemployed also rose to 3.7% in July from 2% a year earlier.
Consumers also faced more challenges finding new jobs. The share of people who changed employers dropped to 4.4% in July from 6.2% a year earlier.
Only 13.5% of individuals said they received at least one job offer in the prior four months, down from 21.0% in July 2019 - a figure that had been rising from March 2018 until March 2020, when the coronavirus began to spread around the world. The average expected likelihood of receiving a job offer in the next four months also dropped sharply to 18.5% in July from 24.1% a year earlier.
A separate survey released by the Fed last week found that government aid provided substantial relief to people affected by the pandemic, with more Americans overall reporting that they were doing OK financially as of July. However, the enhanced unemployment benefits and small business loans rolled out as part of the CARES Act expired in July and negotiations in Congress over another aid package are at a standstill.
The survey also found that people with work are generally more satisfied with their wages and benefits.

The labor survey is done as part of the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations. Approximately 1,000 panelists are polled every four months about job transitions and their current job.

The island's export orders, a bellwether of global technology demand, rose 13.6% in August from a year earlier to $45.5 billion, Ministry of Economic Affairs data showed on Monday, setting a historic high for the month.
The data exceeded an 8.2% rise projected in a Reuters poll and a 12.4% increase in July. It was the sixth consecutive month of gains and the strongest since January 2018.
The ministry said the blockbuster performance was helped by continued strong demand for products such as laptops and tablets, with orders for electronics including smartphones hitting a record high thanks to upcoming new product launches.
Taiwan usually sees strong electronics orders in the third and fourth quarter ahead of the year-end holiday season when vendors launch new smartphone models.
The ministry said it expects export orders to be between a fall of 0.1% and rise of 3.2% in September from a year earlier. It expects demand for electronics to remain strong, but warned of uncertainty over the pandemic and China-U.S. trade frictions.
Taiwan's manufacturers are a key part of the global supply chain for tech giants such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
Orders from the United States for Taiwan's goods rose 19.5% in August from a year earlier, compared with 22.2% growth in July, while those from China were up 21% versus a 16.8% gain the previous month. European orders lifted 21.2%, while those from Japan dropped 3.8%.

Taiwan's central bank last week revised up its growth outlook for the year amid signs the economy is bouncing back from the impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The Make UK industry association and accountants BDO said output and orders had improved from historic lows struck last quarter during the depths of the pandemic.
But the survey's quarterly gauge of investment intentions fell to -32% from -26%, almost touching depths last seen in the financial crisis.
""Manufacturing has begun to climb away from the abyss that it stared into earlier in the year,"" said Stephen Phipson, chief executive at Make UK.
""But, make no mistake it is going to be a long haul back towards normal trading conditions, with talk of a 'V'-shaped recovery nothing more than fanciful.""
The possibility that Britain and the European Union fail to agree a trade deal before the end of the Brexit transition period would be a ""final nail in the coffin"" for many manufacturers, Phipson added.
Output in Britain's manufacturing sector was still 8.7% below its pre-pandemic level in July, according to official data published earlier this month.
Like other indicators of the labour market, manufacturers' employment expectations deteriorated in the latest Make UK/BDO survey, although its gauge of future output improved somewhat.

The survey of 364 companies was conducted between Aug. 5 and Aug. 26.

Sales grew 0.6% in July, versus 23% in June and 21% in May, Statistics Canada said Friday in Ottawa. Excluding vehicles, receipts unexpectedly dropped 0.4%, versus a forecast gain of 0.5%. Preliminary estimates from the agency show receipts climbed 1.1% in August, suggesting the weaker trend will continue.
The report reinforces warnings that the pace of the recovery will slow in the second half of the year, after a strong V-shaped rebound through the early summer.
“All in all, the numbers imply that retail activity is normalizing after the whipsaw of a huge downturn and recovery,” said Scotiabank economist Brett House in a note.
Core retail sales, or those excluding vehicles and gasoline, dropped 1.2%.

Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast retail sales would increase by 1.0% from June, when trade jumped by 22.7% as restrictions imposed to fight the outbreak were removed.
""The data continue to suggest that the pace of growth seen in June wasn't sustained early in the third quarter,"" said Royce Mendes of CIBC Economics.
Sales grew in six of the 11 subsectors, with motor vehicles and parts contributing the most. Gas sales also posted gains.

The Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index, which tracks data collected from public land registries to measure changes for repeat sales of single-family homes, showed prices were up 0.6% in August from July. The average gain for the month over the past 22 years was 0.7%.
The number of repeat sales used to derive indexes was down 1.3% year-over-year, showing some recovery after being down more than 20% in the prior three months.

LONDON (Reuters) - British shoppers spent more last month, taking sales further above pre-COVID levels, as strong online demand helped much of the sector rebound faster than the rest of the economy.
Retail sales volumes rose by 0.8% in August, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday -- slightly above the average 0.7% forecast in a Reuters poll. Compared with a year earlier, they were up 2.8%, just below forecasts of 3.0% annual growth.
Sales had already overtaken pre-COVID levels in July and now stand 4.0% higher than before the crisis, although economists are cautious about what will happen later this year if unemployment rises sharply as forecast.
""Spending may yet stutter as the furlough scheme is wound down and unemployment rises, weighing on household incomes and job security. And other parts of the economy, such as investment, are taking much longer to recover,"" Andrew Wishart of consultancy Capital Economics said.
Retailers have benefited from fewer British people holidaying abroad this summer, pent-up demand from the lockdown, and a shift to spending on household goods rather than activities outside the home.
However, the rebound masks a sharp split between online and high-street retailers. Online and catalogue sales were up 34.4% on the year in August, while primarily in-store clothing sales were 15.5% lower, despite a 13.5% rise from July.
""Overall, the switch to greater online sales means the high street remains under pressure,"" ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said.

The crisis in traditional retailing is having a knock-on effect for commercial landlords, with stores closing and tenants such as clothing chain New Look seeking to renegotiate rents to link them to turnover.
Upmarket department store chain John Lewis wrote off 470 million pounds in the value of its stores in results published on Thursday, and scrapped its annual staff bonus for the first time since 1953.
Grocery sales rose just 0.4% in August, after strong growth in previous months when British people had eaten at home more.
August saw a temporary government promotion for dining in restaurants, named 'Eat Out to Help Out', which earlier industry data suggested had dented grocery demand.
Separate ONS figures on Friday showed the number of British adults visiting restaurants, pubs and cafes fell for the first time since July after the programme ended, dropping to 30% in the week to Sept. 13 from 38% in late August.
The Bank of England said on Thursday that Britain's economy was on course to recover faster than it had forecast in August, but output in the July-September period is still expected to be 7% lower than in 2019's final quarter.
Britain suffered the biggest economic hit of any G7 economy between April and June, when output fell by more than 20%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's next quarterly survey will likely show its big manufacturers were less pessimistic than they were in the June quarter, when business sentiment struck an 11-year low following a nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Fourteen economists polled by Reuters forecast the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan business sentiment survey would show the headline index for big manufacturers' confidence at minus 23 in September, improving from minus 34 in June as sentiment began recovering after a nationwide lockdown was eased.
The June index was the weakest since June 2009, when the economy was in the throes of the Global Financial Crisis.
The sentiment index for big non-manufacturers is expected to have recovered to minus 9 in September from minus 17 marked in June survey, which was the worst reading since December 2009, according to the Reuters poll. 
""Demand recovery after social and economic activities restarted in Japan and overseas helped business sentiment to improve in broad industries,"" said Akane Yamaguchi, economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.
The Reuters poll showed sentiment among both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers over the outlook was likely to remain subdued. 
Big manufacturers' business confidence is expected to recover somewhat to minus 17 in the coming quarter, and non-manufacturers' sentiment is forecast to remain at minus 9, the poll found.
""The pace of recovery in business sentiment is expected to be limited as coronavirus prevention steps remain in place and concerns over a resurgence in the cases continue to be strong,"" Yamaguchi said.
Big companies will likely raise their capital spending plans by 1.3% for this fiscal year to March 2021, revising down from 3.2% projected in the June survey.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices fell at their fastest pace in almost four years in August, dragged mostly by government-sponsored discounts for domestic travel aimed at supporting the battered tourism sector.
The weak consumer price data comes after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Thursday it would monitor not just price trends but jobs growth in guiding policy, signalling a readiness to ramp up stimulus if job losses heighten the risk of deflation.
Japan's new premier Yoshihide Suga on Wednesday pledged to contain COVID-19 and retain his former boss's ""Abenomics"" growth policies while pushing reforms such as deregulation and digitalisation.
The core consumer price index (CPI), which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, fell 0.4% in August from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday.
That compared with the median market forecast for a 0.4% decline and a flat reading in July and matched the level seen in November in 2016. 
The main factor for the fall in the core CPI was a price decline in accommodation and hotels after the government launched subsidies for national travel discounts from late July to revive tourism. 
Prices of accommodation fell 32.0% in August from a year earlier, the index showed.
""Downward pressure on consumer prices will likely continue and the core CPI index could fall to around 1.0% year-on-year later this year,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
He said the travel campaign will continue to weigh on accommodation while the boost to prices from a sales tax hike implemented last October will disappear later this year.
Meanwhile, downward pressure on prices is broadening from the hit to demand caused by the coronavirus.
The so-called core-core price index, which excludes food and energy prices and is closely tracked by the central bank as a narrower gauge of inflation, fell 0.1% in August, the first fall since March 2017. In July, the index gained 0.4%.
""There is also a possibility that weak demand triggered by the coronavirus outbreak could push down consumer prices going ahead, though we haven't seen significant impact on consumer prices so far,"" Shinke said.
The economy shrank an annualised 28.1% in April-June, its biggest postwar contraction.

Analysts see the reopening of businesses after a nationwide shutdown supporting the economy, but firms and consumers remain cautious about the coronavirus outbreak and the pace of recovery may be limited.

The findings represent a sharp turnaround from last year, when a large majority of companies said they intended to keep up or better their rates of recruitment. 
The annual report from the Confederation of British Industry and the Pertemps Network Group recruitment consultancy showed 51% of companies planned to maintain or increase recruitment next year, while 46% foresaw a reduction or a complete stop.
The net balance of +5% compared with +56% in last year's survey.
""The UK labour market has been under heavy stress since the outset of the Covid-19 crisis and, although the economy has started to re-open, pressure on firms remains acute,"" said Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief policy director.
One in three of companies said they planned to implement a pay freeze across all roles - compared with one in 20 in last year's survey.
The figures chimed with a Bank of England survey on Thursday that showed a ""large proportion"" of companies planned to delay or cancel their annual pay reviews.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak is under pressure to announce a partial extension of the government's furlough scheme by targeting help towards the worst-hit sectors of the economy in order to slow a wave of job losses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell less than expected last week and applications for the prior period were revised up, suggesting the labor market recovery had shifted into low gear amid fading fiscal stimulus.
The weekly jobless claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, also showed nearly 30 million people were on unemployment benefits at the end of August, laying bare both the continuing economic and human devastation six months after the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday vowed to keep interest rates near zero for a long time, noting that the coronavirus ""will continue to weigh on economic activity"" in the near term and ""poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said more fiscal support was likely to be needed for the economy.
""With nearly 30 million people unemployed and the ongoing failure of politicians to deliver additional needed fiscal stimulus, the climb out of the pandemic downturn is likely to be slower and more damaging to long-term growth than it should have been,"" said Ron Temple, head of U.S. equity at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 33,000 to a seasonally adjusted 860,000 for the week ended Sept. 12. Data for the prior week was revised to show 9,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 850,000 applications in the latest week.
Unadjusted claims dropped 75,974 to 790,021 last week. Economists prefer the unadjusted claims number given earlier difficulties adjusting the claims data for seasonal fluctuations because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis. 
A total 658,737 applications were received for the government-funded pandemic unemployment assistance last week. The PUA is for the self-employed, gig workers and others who do not qualify for the regular state unemployment programs. Altogether, 1.45 million people filed claims last week.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 916,000 to 12.628 million in the week ending Sept. 5. Economists attributed the drop in the so-called continuing claims to people exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which are limited to 26 weeks in most states.
The number of people on a government-funded program that provides up to 13 additional weeks of benefits to individuals who have exhausted their regular unemployment compensation increased 104,683 to 1.5 million in the week ending Aug. 29.
""The crisis has yet to abate, rehiring is growing slowly, and the struggles of families and businesses continue to fester,"" said Andrew Stettner, senior fellow at The Century Foundation in New York.
A third report from the Philadelphia Fed on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region moderating in September, though manufacturers remained optimistic about growth over the next six months. Reports this week showed a slowdown in retail sales and production at factories in August.

LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY
After declining from a record 6.867 million at the end of March, as businesses reopened after being shuttered to stem the spread of the coronavirus, claims have flattened, with layoffs spilling over to industries not initially impacted by the mandated closures. 
A $600 weekly unemployment benefits supplement ended in July and was replaced with a $300 weekly subsidy, which is not available in all states and is expected to run out of funding this month. A program to help businesses with wages lapsed in August, while $25 billion in government assistance for airline payrolls expires this month. 
Last week's claims covered the period during which the government surveyed businesses for the nonfarm payrolls component of September's employment report. 
""Unemployment insurance claims indicate that job growth will be slower through the rest of 2020 and that full recovery in the labor market will take years,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The economy added 1.371 million jobs in August and has recouped 10.6 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost at the depth of the coronavirus crisis.
Unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters, limiting the hit from the pandemic on the housing market. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 4.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.021 million units in August. 
Further gains are likely, with building permits for single-family housing units accelerating 6.0% to a rate of 1.036 million units, the highest since May 2007. A 22.7% tumble in starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment, however, led to a 5.1% drop in overall homebuilding to a rate of 1.416 million units last month. 

The housing market is being fueled by record low interest rates and a pandemic-fueled migration to suburbs and low density areas.

Housing starts dropped 5.1% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.416 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. Data for July was revised slightly lower to a 1.492 million-unit pace from the previously reported 1.496 million. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts slipping to a rate of 1.478 million units.
A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders increased to a record high in September. Builders, however, remained concerned about rising costs for materials and delivery delays, especially for lumber.
The housing market has outperformed the broader economy despite nearly 30 million people being on unemployment benefits. Unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.86%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).
Home building last month was pulled down by a 22.7% tumble in starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment to a pace of 395,000 units. But construction of singe-family housing units, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, increased 4.1% to a rate of 1.021 million units.
Groundbreaking activity rose in the West and Midwest, but fell in the South and Northeast.

Permits for future homebuilding dropped 0.9% to a rate of 1.470 million units in August. Single-family building permits increased 6.0% to a rate of 1.036 million units. Multi-family building permits decreased 14.2% to a rate of 434,000 units.

Investing.com -- Initial claims for jobless benefits continued their painfully slow decline last week, with the number of Americans filing for the first time falling less than expected to 860,000. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised up its figure for the previous week to 893,000 from 884,000 originally reported.
The number of continuing jobless claims, by contrast, fell by more than 900,000 to 12.628 million, its lowest since the first surge in joblessness caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the spring. However, the BLS's most comprehensive measure of total unemployment, which includes those claiming under the two pandemic-related assistance schemes, rose again to 29.77 million as of August 29, the last week for which data are available. That's an increase of 98,000 from the previous week.
There have been suggestions, not least from California Governor Gavin Newsom, that a large part of the recent rise in claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance have been fraudulent, with claimants exploiting past data breaches across the U.S. to file unjustified claims.
Elsewhere, data from the housing market showed that sector of the economy cooling off after three months of an extremely strong rebound. Housing starts in August fell by more than expected to 1.416 million, while building permits fell slightly to 1.47 million, disappointing hopes for a rise to 1.52 million.
The housing market has been one of the bright spots of the U.S. economy's recovery since the second quarter, propelled by falling rates for remortgaging and by the desire of many cash-rich city-dwellers to escape to the suburbs in anticipation of a future where working from home will be more widespread.
The National Association of Home Builders housing market index, which tracks the level of sales rather than prices, rose to an all-time high of 83, according to a release from the NAHB on Wednesday."

In the two weeks to Sept. 6, 10% of Britain's workforce was signed up to the government's furlough programme, down from 11% in the previous two-week period, the ONS said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak is under pressure to announce a partial extension of the scheme by targeting help towards the worst-hit sectors of the economy in order to slow a wave of job losses. 
While he has said the scheme will not be prolonged beyond the planned closure on Oct. 31, earlier this week he said he would be ""creative"" in seeking new ways to stave off unemployment.
Data on Tuesday showed Britain's unemployment rate increased to 4.1% in the three months to July from the 3.9% level it had clung to since early 2020.
The Bank of England has forecast that unemployment will hit 7.5% at the end of this year, when it is expected to expand its bond-buying stimulus programme again.
Clues about its next move are likely to emerge at 1100 GMT, when it publishes the results of its September policy meeting.
The ONS survey also showed 11% of businesses saw a moderate to severe risk of insolvency - little changed from previous readings.
The ONS also said the proportion of adults travelling to work rose above 60% for the first time.

Inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 0.4% month-on-month in August for a -0.2% year-on-year decline, Eurostat said, in line with its own earlier estimate and market expectations.
Energy prices which fell 7.8% year-on-year in August had the biggest impact on the overall consumer price index, subtracting 0.77 percentage point from the final number. 
Non-energy industrial goods pulled the index a further 0.03 percentage point lower, offsetting the 0.33 point positive contribution from food alcohol and tobacco and 0.30 point from services.
Without the volatile food and energy prices, or what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices fell 0.5% on the month for a 0.6% annual increase, as expected by economists polled by Reuters. This is a deceleration from 1.3% year-on-year growth in July.
An even narrower measure of inflation which also excludes alcohol and tobacco prices, fell 0.6% month-on-month for a 0.4% year-on-year increase, slowing from 1.2% growth in July.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's jobless rate unexpectedly slipped from a 22-year high in August as employment surged past expectations helped by part-time work, but the economic toll from the pandemic has hit young job seekers hard.
The country's overall jobless rate fell to 6.8% in August as employment skyrocketed by 111,000, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed on Thursday. That was better than economists' forecasts of 7.7% and a 50,000 fall in jobs in a Reuters poll.
But the figures were less positive for 15 to 24 year olds, with the unemployment rate now hovering near 20%, more than three times the national tally. During the 2008/09 global financial crisis, the rate was 10%-12%.
""These people are at risk of being the forgotten victims of COVID, if policy doesn't address youth unemployment,"" said Matthew Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual.
Higher welfare dependency, significant loss to economy and social issues are some of the side effects of high and rising youth unemployment, Sherwood added.
Jemish Lakhani, who is studying for a Masters degree in accounting from the University of Wollongong in Sydney, concurs with Sherwood. 
""Everyday I fear if I'd ever find a job. I have zero experience in accounting,"" says Lakhani who will graduate next year. 
Lakhani, an international student from India, has been struggling to make ends meet since losing his part-time job at a restaurant in May. 
He has since signed up to deliver food via UberEats and spends most of his afternoons near a busy restaurant strip in Sydney's west.
""Business has been lukewarm"", he said. ""The money is alright but there are days when I wait for hours outside a restaurant to make just A$20 ($14.6).""
Thursday's data showed a majority of the job surge in August employment was led by those like Lakhani who are sole traders or ""non-employees as the hours worked only inched up a paltry 0.1%.
POOR PRINT
""It is fair to infer that many of those new workers hardly worked for many hours. That leaves us describing this as a poor employment print,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) economist Phil Odonaghoe.
The Australian dollar , which pared losses after the data, soon slipped into negative territory to last stand at $0.7279.
Lakhani is among the tens of thousands in Australia who lost their jobs to the pandemic with little hope of finding work though the economy reopened earlier than expected.
Rising unemployment is becoming a headache for the federal government which is pushing states to ease regional shutdowns and open up internal borders as new COVID-19 cases ease.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg delivers the federal budget on Oct. 6 where he is expected to announce some policies to help youth while also expanding its broader A$300 billion fiscal support.
One reason young people are taking the brunt of the economic fallout is that retail and hospitality sectors - which employ 45% of young people compared with 27% of other age groups - have been crippled by COVID-induced lockdowns.
The situation is dire for those not eligible for government welfare payments.
Sydney resident Daniella Youkhana, 32, was made redundant from full-time work last month but she is not eligible for government support because of her redundancy package.

""That money is small, it's not going to last me long,"" said Youkhana, who has since applied for more than 20 jobs without success. ""I even applied for a shelf-stacking job at the supermarket but got denied. It's quite tough out there.""

1509,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 10:18PM ET</span>","New Zealand Banks Need Bigger Capital Buffers, Central Bank Says","(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand’s central bank said a stress test it ran on lenders to assess their resilience to economic shocks supports its decision to require bigger capital buffers.
While all banks would survive a downturn that might occur once every 50 to 75 years, their capital levels would fall below minimum requirements when faced with a 1-in-200 year event, the Reserve Bank said Thursday in Wellington. The test “illustrates the benefit and necessity of shoring up bank capital in the good times to provide resilience,” the RBNZ said. “The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated that large shocks can occur with very little warning.”
The RBNZ decided at the end of last year to increase capital requirements for banks, but delayed implementation of the new rules until July 2021 after the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic. It is now considering whether a further delay is warranted as it encourages banks to keep lending during the economic slump.
A decision is due by Nov. 25, when the bank publishes its next Financial Stability Report.
“All options are on the table,” Head of Financial System Policy and Analysis Toby Fiennes told a media briefing today. “We do not want the banks to be challenged at meeting higher levels of capital while we also want them to use the buffers that they have to support the economy through their lending. In an ideal world, Covid would have hit after they built up those buffers.”
The original plan called for banks to increase buffers over seven years. The largest lenders, which are all Australian-owned, would need to raise their level of high-quality Tier-1 capital to 16% of risk-weighted assets, amounting to a total of about NZ$20 billion ($13 billion).
If the RBNZ presses ahead, it will be asking banks to increase capital at a time when their profits may be eroded by historically low interest rates. The RBNZ is buying bonds to reduce borrowing costs during the recession, and has said it may take its benchmark rate into negative territory next year.
“The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic provides a stark reminder to us all of the importance of being prepared for the unexpected, especially when you are a systemically important bank at the core of New Zealand’s financial system,” Deputy Governor Geoff Bascand said in a statement with the stress test results. “The more capital a bank holds, the better it can weather economic storms and meet customer needs during tough times like now.”
The central bank instructed banks earlier this year to suspend dividend payments during the Covid crisis.
“The results of this stress test supports decisions that were made as part of the Capital Review to increase bank capital levels,” the RBNZ said today. “The findings will help to inform Reserve Bank decisions on the timing of the implementation of the Capital Review, and any changes to current dividend restrictions.”

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand fell into its deepest economic slump on record in the second quarter as its battle against the coronavirus pandemic paralysed business activity, official data showed on Thursday.
Gross domestic product contracted a seasonally adjusted 12.2% quarter-on-quarter, its sharpest quarterly contraction on record and largely in line with forecasts of a 12.8% decline from economists polled by Reuters. GDP fell 12.4% year-on-year.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand had forecast a quarterly and annual GDP decline of 14% in its August statement.
Growth has been hit by a standstill in economic activity as a strict nationwide coronavirus lockdown in April and parts of May forced almost everyone to stay at home and businesses to shut.
The GDP data confirms New Zealand's worst recession, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, since 2010, with GDP in the March quarter falling 1.6%.
In comparison, second quarter economic growth in neighbouring Australia which enforced a less stringent COVID-19 lockdown fell 7.0%, while the United States recorded a 9.1% drop.
But economists say New Zealand will bounce back faster, while other nations are still struggling to contain the coronavirus.
""We expect the June quarter’s record-breaking GDP decline to be followed by a record-breaking rise in the September quarter,"" said Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon. 
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government, which faces an election on Oct. 17, has said success in suppressing the virus locally is likely to help recovery prospects.
Treasury forecasts released on Wednesday showed that while New Zealand's response to COVID-19 helped lessen the short-term economic shock, massive debt and continuing disruptions will delay a full recovery.

Economists say the GDP data will have little impact on the central bank's policy, which is expected to hold interest rates at a record low of 0.25% at its meeting on Sept. 23.

1513,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",New Zealand Economy Contracts The Most Since Great Depression,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand suffered its worst economic slump since the Great Depression in the second quarter as a strict nationwide lockdown to combat the coronavirus brought the country to a standstill.
Gross domestic product plunged 12.2% from the first quarter, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday in Wellington. That’s the biggest three-month contraction since quarterly records began in 1977. Economists forecast a 12.5% decline. From a year earlier, the economy shrank 12.4%, the most recorded in comparable official data dating back to 1955.
New Zealand is going through a sharper but shorter economic shock than it experienced during the depression, when GDP fell 5.3% in 1931 and a further 7.1% in 1932, according to academic research. Nor is the Covid slump as bad as initially feared. The South Pacific nation succeeded in eliminating community spread of the virus, allowing it to emerge early from lockdown, and indicators suggest growth surged in the third quarter as consumers went on a spending spree.
However, the real pain may still lie ahead. The border remains closed to foreigners, crippling the tourism industry, and the end of the government’s wage subsidy is expected to see unemployment rise.
The New Zealand dollar was little changed at 67.36 U.S. cents after the release.
Today’s report confirms the first recession -- defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline -- since 2010. GDP fell a revised 1.4% in the first quarter of the year, the statistics agency said.
The data are unlikely to dent Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s chances of winning a second term in the Oct. 17 election. Ardern is riding high in the polls after her deft handling of the pandemic.
New Zealand’s seven-week lockdown began in the final week of March and ended in May. While a fresh community outbreak of Covid-19 in mid-August required a second lockdown in largest city Auckland, the country has fared better than many of its peers who still don’t have the virus under control.
U.K. GDP plummeted 20.4% in the second quarter from the first and 21.7% from a year earlier. In the U.S., the economy shrank 9.5% in the quarter, a drop that equals an annualized pace of 32.9%, its sharpest downturn since at least the 1940s.
Australia’s economy shrank less -- 7% in the quarter and 6.3% in the year -- but it is not expected to enjoy the same bounce back in activity in the third quarter that New Zealand is experiencing.
The government has pledged NZ$62 billion ($42 billion) of fiscal support to help revive domestic demand and protect jobs, while the central bank has slashed interest rates and embarked on quantitative easing to drive down borrowing costs. Reserve Bank policy makers are considering taking interest rates negative to further nurse the economy through the downturn.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending slowed in August, with a key retail sales gauge unexpectedly declining, as extended unemployment benefits were cut for millions of Americans, offering more evidence that the economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession was faltering.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday ramped up pressure on the White House and Congress to restart stalled negotiations for another fiscal package. At least 29.6 million people are on unemployment benefits. Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy. 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept interest rates near zero, noting that the pandemic ""will continue to weigh on economic activity"" in the near term, ""and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.""
Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters more fiscal support is likely to be needed.
""Consumers are being increasingly cautious with their spending,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""If Congress is unable to extend fiscal aid to households in the coming weeks, the economy will be particularly susceptible to a cutback in consumer spending, especially from the lowest-income families.""
Retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services dipped 0.1% last month after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase in July. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have advanced 1.4% in July. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core retail sales rising 0.5% in August. Overall retail sales increased 0.6% in August, in part as sales at restaurants and bars continued to recover. Data for July was revised down to show retail sales increasing 0.9% instead of 1.2% as previously reported.
Retail sales account for the goods component of consumer spending, with services such as healthcare, education, travel and hotel accommodation making up the other portion. Services have been hardest hit by the coronavirus, which plunged the economy into recession in February, and spending on services remains about 10% below the pre-pandemic level. 
U.S. stocks were trading higher. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S Treasury prices were lower.
SLOWDOWN BROADENING
The retail sales report followed data this month suggesting the labor market was losing speed after astounding employment gains in May and June as businesses reopened after being shuttered in mid-March to control the spread of the coronavirus. 
Job growth slowed further in August and new applications for unemployment benefits remained perched at extraordinarily high levels in early September. At the same time, manufacturing is also showing signs of tiring, with output slowing last month.
A $600 weekly unemployment subsidy expired in July. It was replaced by a $300 weekly supplement, which was not available in all states, and funds for the program are expected to run out this month. Economists estimated that the reduced unemployment benefits supplement cut income by about $70 billion in August.
Government money was credited for the sharp turnaround in economic activity that started in May. Still, consumer spending is expected to rebound strongly in the third quarter because of robust momentum in core retail sales at the tail end of the April-June quarter. 
Consumer spending suffered a record collapse in the second quarter. The pullback in core retail sales in August, if sustained, would set up consumer spending on a slower growth path in the fourth quarter. Growth estimates for the third quarter top a 30% annualized rate. The economy contracted at a historic 31.7% pace in the April-June quarter.
""We have concerns about how strong the recovery will be in the fourth quarter and our optimistic 7.0% real GDP growth looks on increasingly shaky ground unless more jobless workers can find a place in this economy,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. 
The slowdown in spending last month was underscored by a 5.7% drop in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Receipts at food and beverage stores fell 1.2%, while online and mail-order retail sales were flat. 
Sales at electronics and appliance stores rose just 0.8% after surging 20.7% in July. Receipts at auto dealerships rebounding 0.2% after falling 1.0% in July. 
While sales at clothing outlets gained 2.9%, they remained 20% below the February level. Receipts at restaurants and bars rose 4.7%. Though sales at these establishments accounted for a chunk of overall retail sales last month, they were still more than 16% below their pre-pandemic level. 
Sales at building material stores rebounded 2.0% and receipts at furniture outlets rose 2.1%. The strength in these categories likely reflects a resilient housing market, which is being boosted by historically low mortgage rates and the migration to suburbs and lower-density areas as more workers continue to operate from home because of the pandemic.

A report on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders rose to a record high in September.

Investing.com – The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged Wednesday, and reiterated that monetary policy would remain accommodative for a prolonged period to support the economy's ongoing recovery.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25%.
The unchanged decision comes just weeks after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell unveiled the central bank's average inflation targeting regime, designed to allow inflation to overshoot its 2% target in an effort to achieve long-term price stability. The move has raised expectations that rates could be held near zero for longer than would have been the case under the Fed's previous target, with some market participants forecasting no rate hikes for some time.
The latest economic projections from the Fed appear to support expectations for rates to remain lower for longer, with policymakers backing the central bank to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.1% through 2023. 
Many argue that the Fed had raised rates too quickly in the Financial Crisis era, on expectations that inflation would eventually trend toward target, underpinned by a hot labor market. The new approach seeks to avoid a repeat of inflation running below target for a prolonged period.
""With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent,"" The Fed said in a statement. ""(I)t will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.""
The Fed's pledge to keep rates near zero and persist with asset purchases has helped support an uptick in economic activity.
The central bank expects the economy to contract by 3.7% in 2020, compared with an estimate for a 6.5% decline previously. But growth in 2021 and 2022 was revised lower to 4% and 3% from 5% and 3.5% respectively.
The stimulus measures have spurred a rebound in the pace of inflation and the labor market, which currently tracking above expectations.
Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, while core PCE inflation, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, came in at 1.3%.
In the wake of the stronger data, the Fed revised its unemployment rate forecasts for the year to 7.6%, down from 9.3% previously. While inflation is expected to pick up pace and reach 1.2% by year-end, up from a previous forecast of 0.8%.
Looking ahead, the bank sees unemployment falling to 4.6% by 2022, down from a prior estimate of 5.5% previously.  While inflation for 2021 and 2022 was revised higher to 1.7% and 1.8% from 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, but is set for a faster climb to about 2% in 2023.
The Fed’s balance sheet has increased in recent weeks to over $7 trillion, nearing the June peak of about $7.2 trillion."

(Reuters) - Slower-than-expected sales at retailers in August suggest a speed bump is emerging in the U.S. economic recovery from coronavirus lockdowns, less than two months before the Nov. 3 presidential election. 
Overall, retail sales have returned to their pre-crisis levels and then some, gaining 0.6% in August, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. The rebound plays into U.S. President Donald Trump's narrative of resurgent growth after a sharp pandemic downturn. Incumbent presidents are generally helped at the polls by a strong economy, and hurt by a weak one.
But last month's rise was driven in part by an increase in gasoline prices, not typically a cause for consumer celebration. Meanwhile core retail sales, a closer measure of underlying spending trends, fell 0.1% last month. Both readings fell short of economists' expectations.
GRAPHIC: A rebound, then sideways? - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-RETAILSALES/azgpoamerpd/ 
Back-to-school shopping season, or the lack of it, was one cause. Many students actually could not head back to the classroom because of COVID-19 restrictions, and their curbed spending on supplies helped drive down core retail spending, said Regions Financial Corp (NYSE:RF) economist Richard Moody. Meanwhile, a jump in sales at restaurants and bars drove most of the gain in overall retail sales. 
The softening comes as nearly 30 million Americans are on some form of unemployment insurance. An extra $600 weekly that out-of-work-adults were getting in government aid expired at the end of July; it was replaced by a program that sent out $300 payments, but stopped taking new applicants on Sept. 10.
Lawmakers have so far failed to agree to any new aid package, and without more fiscal help, economists say the recovery will stall. 

""The economy is weak: there are no two sides around that,"" says Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB). Part of a voter's calculus in picking a president may be, ""Do you think additional stimulus is necessary, and if so what do you want that to look like?""

Business inventories edged up 0.1% in July after declining 1.1% in June, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Inventories, a key component of gross domestic product, had dropped for six straight months. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast business stocks gaining 0.1% in July.
Retail inventories rebounded 1.2% in July as estimated in an advance report published last month. That followed a 2.7% decrease in June. Goods imports soared a record 12.3% in July, the government reported last month.
Motor vehicle inventories increased 2.7% rather than 2.5% as previously reported. Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.6% as estimated last month.
An inventory drawdown contributed to GDP declining at a record 31.7% annualized rate in the second quarter. Inventories subtracted 3.5 percentage points from GDP, the most since the first quarter of 1988. Inventories have declined for five straight quarters. The economy fell into recession is February.
Wholesale inventories fell 0.3% in July. Stocks at manufacturers dropped 0.5%. 

Business sales increased 3.2% in July after shooting up 8.6% in June. At July's sales pace, it would take 1.33 months for businesses to clear shelves, down from 1.37 months in June.

The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) rose five points to an all-time high of 83 this month, data showed on Wednesday. A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view conditions as good than poor. 
Builders, however, remained concerned about rising costs for materials and delivery delays, especially for lumber.
""Lumber prices are now up more than 170 percent since mid-April, adding more than $16,000 to the price of a typical new single-family home,"" said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz.
""That said, the suburban shift for home building is keeping builders busy, supported on the demand side by low interest rates. In another sign of this growing trend, builders in other parts of the country have reported receiving calls from customers in high-density markets asking about relocating.""
The housing market has pushed ahead despite nearly 30 million people being on unemployment benefits. Economists say unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average of 2.86%, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC).

The HMI survey's current sales conditions index rose four points to 88 this month. The component measuring sales expectations in the next six months increased six points to 84 and the measure of prospective buyers jumped nine points to 73.

1520,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",U.S. Retail Sales Rebound Slows After Extra Jobless Aid Lapses,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retail sales rose less than forecast in August as the expiration of supplemental jobless benefits weighed on incomes and spending despite solid employment gains.
The value of overall sales increased 0.6% after a downwardly revised 0.9% increase the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed Wednesday. So-called control group sales, which exclude food services, car dealers, building-materials stores and gasoline stations, fell 0.1%, also missing estimates. The measure is often considered more reflective of underlying consumer demand.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for the overall measure to increase 1% from the prior month.
With many more stores and restaurants now open, the initial boost in spending driven by reopenings is moderating. At the same time, the expiration of the supplemental $600 weekly payments at the end of July as well as slowdowns in back-to-school spending likely weighed on retail activity during the month.
Those benefits bolstered incomes during the pandemic, and without them, millions of unemployed Americans will have significantly less cash to support the nation’s retailers. Lawmakers appear increasingly unlikely to approve additional stimulus until after the election, despite still-elevated joblessness.
Nine out of 13 major categories increased in August, led by restaurants, clothing stores and furniture outlets. Receipts at motor vehicle and parts dealers posted a modest gain, while sales at nonstore retailers barely improved. Sporting goods and hobby stores posted the biggest percentage decline from the prior month and receipts at department stores weakened. Grocery store sales fell as well.
With total retail sales data above pre-pandemic levels, the data underscore a shift in where consumers are spending their money. Some categories, like restaurants and clothing stores, are still below year-ago levels. Meanwhile, purchases at nonstore retailers are up 22.4% from August of last year.
Retail sales don’t capture all consumer spending though, and the pandemic continues to have a clear impact on services outlays. While the value of retail receipts exceeded February levels back in June, personal consumption -- which includes spending on goods and services -- was still below its pre-pandemic level in July, the latest available data. The Commerce Department will release the August figures Oct. 1.
Another factor to keep in mind is the Lost Wages Assistance program. That’s the program President Donald Trump authorized in early August to temporarily offset part of the income gap unemployed Americans faced after the expiration of the extra $600 in weekly benefits. However, rollout of the program has been patchy across states.

Investing.com -- U.S. retail sales grew at the slowest rate in four months in August, as spending tailed off in the wake of the expiry of enhanced unemployment benefits at the end of July.
The Commerce Department said that overall retail sales grew only 0.6% in August from July, rather than the 1.0% rise expected. July's rise of 1.2% was also revised down to 0.9%. Growth in core retail sales, a series that excludes automobiles, also slowed to 0.7% from a downwardly revised 1.3% a month earlier. 
The news is consistent with other data showing that the economic rebound has lost dynamism in recent weeks after bouncing sharply from the lows of the second quarter. U.S. industrial production and manufacturing output also slowed in August, according to figures released on Tuesday.  The news comes only hours before the Federal Reserve announces the results of its latest two-day policy meeting.

1522,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",UK diner discounts push inflation down to near five-year low,"By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - A hefty drop in meal prices, spurred by Britain's scheme to support the hospitality sector through the COVID-19 pandemic, helped to push inflation down last month to its lowest rate in almost five years.
Consumer prices rose by 0.2% in annual terms in August, the smallest increase since December 2015 and a sharp slowdown from July's 1.0% increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 0.0%.
Discounts for more than 100 million meals were claimed Last month through the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" programme, which offered diners a state-funded price reduction of up to 10 pounds ($12.89).
While this prompted an unusually large fall in the rate of inflation, the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy and a coming surge in unemployment look likely to keep consumer prices in check.
Prices in restaurants and cafes were down 2.6% compared with August last year, their first fall since records began in 1989.
Falls in air fares and a smaller-than-usual rise in clothes prices also helped to push annual inflation down.
""While we expect an initial bounce-back in inflation in September, as the 'Eat Out to Help Out' scheme comes to an end, overall inflation is likely to remain well below the Bank of England's target for some time,"" said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG.
The consumer price index has now been below the BoE's target for 13 months in a row.
Most economists polled by Reuters think sharply rising unemployment and a slowing recovery will prompt the BoE to pump more stimulus into the economy before the end of this year. 
The ONS said eight items in its inflation basket were still unavailable to its price collectors, reflecting things that remain off-limits such as tickets to the theatre, soccer matches and horse racing, and catering for more than 50 people.
In April, during the most stringent period of the lockdown, 90 items had been unavailable.
There were already signs that inflation pressure would remain weak.
Factory output prices fell for the fifth month in a row in annual terms - the longest such run in four years - as weaker oil prices pushed them down by 0.9%.
Excluding oil and other volatile components, core factory output prices showed no change in annual terms, their weakest showing in nearly five years.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports posted a double-digit slump for a sixth straight month in August as U.S.-bound shipments shrank due to a global demand slowdown from the coronavirus pandemic, casting a shadow over a trade-led recovery from the deep recession.
The export decline highlights the immense task Yoshihide Suga, who is assured to be elected prime minister later on Wednesday, faces in driving an economic recovery.
Total exports fell 14.8% year-on-year in August, a smaller decline than the 16.1% expected by economists in a Reuters poll, official data showed on Wednesday.
That meant exports fell for their 21st straight month, marking the longest run of declines since a 23-month run through July 1987. That followed a 19.2% drop in the previous month.
The decline in August was driven by fewer shipments of cars and mineral fuels, though the pace of contraction eased somewhat from July as economic activity showed signs of picking up.
""Strong demand for ICT technology linked to working from home resulted in exports of electric machinery only falling 5.5% year-on-year,"" said Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics.
""However, export volumes may not reach pre-virus levels until early-2022,"" he said in a note.
Suga, who won a ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership election on Monday, will face a huge challenge to get the economy back on track after it posted its worst postwar contraction in the second quarter.
By region, shipments to the United States - Japan's key market - fell 21.3% in the year to August, weighed heavily by declines in engine parts and construction machinery.
Exports to China, Japan's largest trading partner, rose 5.1% year-on-year in August, helped by a sharp increase in shipments of semiconductors, the data showed.
That marked the second straight monthly rise in China-bound shipments, which showed signs of picking up, a finance ministry official said.
Exports to the rest of Asia declined 7.8%, weighed by shrinking exports of iron and steel products.
Overall imports fell 20.8% in the year to August, versus the median estimate for an 18.0% decrease.

As a result, the trade balance came to a surplus of 248.3 billion yen ($2.36 billion), versus the median estimate for a 37.5 billion yen shortfall.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. factory production increased for a fourth straight month in August, but the recovery is showing signs of strain, suggesting business investment in equipment could remain depressed through the end of the year as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on.
The report from the Federal Reserve on Tuesday added to data on the labor market that has indicated a stall in overall economic activity because of the coronavirus' persistence and fading fiscal stimulus. The ebbing economic recovery, accompanied by warming inflation, is likely to dominate the U.S. central bank's two-day policy meeting, which started on Tuesday. 
""It is looking increasingly like the recovery in factory production will stall in coming months if no one from Washington is going to ride to the rescue with another pandemic stimulus package,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The coronavirus has made the public cautious and this uncertainty is keeping factories from opening back up completely."" 
Manufacturing production rose 1.0% last month after advancing 3.9% in July. The Fed noted that ""the gains for most manufacturing industries have gradually slowed since June."" Factory output remains 6.7% below its February level. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast manufacturing output would rise 1.2% in August. 
Government financial aid to businesses and the unemployed has virtually dried up, and talks on another package are at an impasse. At least 29.6 million people were on unemployment benefits in August. Government money was credited for the sharp rebound in economic activity. Cheaper crude oil because of the pandemic is also hurting oilfield services and equipment firms.
The International Energy Agency on Tuesday slashed its 2020 oil demand forecast, warning ""the outlook appears even more fragile.""
Brent crude is trading around $40 a barrel. Business spending on equipment has declined for five straight quarters.
A separate report from the New York Fed on Tuesday showed manufacturing conditions in New York state improving further in September, but the lingering virus was seen restricting activity.
""Weak demand, supply chain disruptions, and fears of a virus resurgence will weigh on the manufacturing sector's recovery until a health solution is discovered and broadly available,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
Stocks on Wall Street rose as investors looked for more stimulus from the Fed. The dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. 
AUTO PRODUCTION FALLS
Last month, production of long-lasting manufactured goods increased 0.7%. Motor vehicle production, however, dropped 3.7% after accelerating 31.7% in July. There were increases in the output of machinery, furniture, computer and electronic products as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components, goods that complement life under the pandemic.
Production of apparel and leather products increased as did the output of plastics and rubber goods. 
The rise in manufacturing offset declines in both mining and utilities output, lifting industrial production 0.4% in August. Industrial output rose 3.5% in July.
Mining production fell 2.5% in August as Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Laura caused what the Fed said were ""sharp but temporary"" drops in oil and gas extraction and well drilling on the Gulf Coast. Utilities output fell 0.4%, with small decreases in both electric and gas utilities. 
Capacity utilization for the manufacturing sector, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, increased to 70.2% in August from 69.5% in July. Overall capacity use for the industrial sector ticked up to 71.4% from 71.1% in July. It is 8.4 percentage points below its 1972-2019 average.
Officials at the U.S. central bank tend to look at capacity use measures for signals of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy - how far growth has room to run before it becomes inflationary.
A third report on Tuesday from the Labor Department showed import prices rose 0.9% in August as the costs of goods increased broadly after accelerating 1.2% in July. Economists had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, would increase 0.5% in August. 
The rise in import prices mirrored further gains in both consumer and producer prices in August. But these developments are unlikely to have an impact on monetary policy as the Fed last month rewrote its framework, putting new emphasis on the labor market and less on worries about too-high inflation.
Last month, prices for imported fuels and lubricants rose 3.3% after advancing 15.1% in July. Imported food prices rebounded 0.4% in August after dropping 0.9% in the prior month.
Excluding fuels and food, import prices accelerated 0.7% last month, the largest gain since April 2011, after rising 0.3% in July. The so-called core import prices shot up 0.9% in the 12 months through August. Further gains are likely, with the dollar falling about 3.6% against the currencies of the United States' major trading partners since June.
""While a few industries are experiencing production bottlenecks, there are wide swathes of unused capacity throughout the economy, which will restrain inflation in the near term,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. median household income hit a record high in 2019 and the poverty rate fell, according to a government survey released on Tuesday that offered a snapshot of the economy before millions of American jobs were destroyed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. Census Bureau said real median household income jumped 6.8% from $64,324 in 2018 to $68,703 last year - the highest since the agency began tracking the data in 1967.
It also said the nation's poverty rate fell last year to 10.5%, a 1.3-percentage-point drop. Another measure of poverty that adjusts for government aid programs for low-income Americans showed a drop to 11.7% last year from 12.8% in 2018.
At the same time, however, the number of people without health insurance for at least part of the year hit 29.6 million, up one million from the year before. The number of uninsured children also grew.
The report offered a look back at the state of the economy before the novel coronavirus outbreak hit the United States early this year, shuttering many businesses as the country sought to contain the pandemic. 
Since then, more than 6.5 million people in the United States have contracted the highly contagious virus and more than 194,000 have died. Vast swaths of the economy were devastated and 22 million Americans were thrown out of work.
While activity is now rebounding, economists warn that the recovery may be uneven as federal stimulus money runs out with no signs of replenishment from Washington. A potential second wave of COVID-19 infections this autumn and winter as people move back indoors also looms large.
President Donald Trump, who had staked his re-election on economic gains before the outbreak, has downplayed impact of the virus and the risk of another wave, as he has urged states to fully re-open. He has also repeatedly touted gains on Wall Street - a narrow gauge of economic performance - and pledged to rebuild the economy if he wins a second term. 
His Democratic rival in the Nov. 3 election, former Vice President Joe Biden, has said the gains since COVID-19 emerged have been uneven and have left many segments of the working population still reeling.
""Those at the top see things going up. But those in the middle and below see things getting worse. And we have leaders who bear false witness, want us to believe that our country isn't gone off track,"" Biden said on Monday.
A Reuters/Ispos poll in late August showed American's support for Trump's handling of the economy has slipped. 
The income and poverty data for 2019, the last year of the economic expansion following the 2007-2009 Great Recession, ""do not reflect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or the current recession,"" Census' Social, Economic and Housing Statistics Division chief David Waddington told reporters on a conference call.

Census officials and private economists cautioned that the COVID-19 outbreak impacted data collection as the agency suspended in-person interviews earlier this year.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Debt-laden Turkish companies are seeking more time to repay bank loans after the coronavirus pandemic upended plans to sell assets, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
Even before the virus hit Turkey in March, firms were seeking lower rates from banks after an aggressive monetary easing campaign and since then, large and small companies are looking for further revisions to nearly all of the restructurings agreed in the past two years, according to one of the sources.
Conglomerate Dogus was among the companies preparing for talks, according to the source, who requested anonymity.
In response to a query from Reuters, Dogus said: ""Our regular and usual negotiations with banks are, as always, underway within the framework of good relations.""
Other restructuring talks involving major companies are already happening, the source said.
Businesses in Turkey, like counterparts in other parts of the world, have been hit hard by lockdowns to try and stop the spread of the virus with the economy shrinking nearly 10% in the second quarter.
But Turkish companies were already weakened by a 2018 currency crisis and some, including Dogus, Yildiz and several energy firms signed billions of dollars worth of restructuring deals.
Asset sales were a key part of some of those restructuring agreements but the impact of the coronavirus crisis has deterred some would-be buyers, the sources said.
Turkish conglomerate and food giant Yildiz Holding last month announced a revision in which it said it paid off $600 million for its syndication credit and extended the maturity to 2030.
The company declined to comment for this story. 
In February, Reuters reported some conglomerates, including Dogus and Yildiz, were in talks for cheaper loans after the central bank cut rates from 24% in mid-2019. The policy rate is now 8.25% but hikes could be in store given high inflation and a record low lira.

While M&A activity has largely stalled this year, some deals were struck including Zynga's (O:ZNGA) purchase of Turkish mobile-game maker Peak for $1.8 billion in June.

The academy, which is affiliated to China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, said on Monday that it expected the number of domestic tourists to fall by 43% to 3.43 billion this year.
China, where the coronavirus first emerged late last year, introduced strict lockdowns and measures to curb its spread which are seen to have largely worked, as the country has largely reopened its economy and allowed normal life to resume.
The country's aviation capacity has snapped back to more than 90% of pre-pandemic levels, but the sector is still working hard to recover from the first half of the year, which saw the number of domestic tourists dropping 62% to 1.17 billion on year, and tourism revenue plummet 77%, according to government data. 
""We are relatively optimistic about the tourism economy in the latter half of 2020,"" the China Tourism Academy concluded. 
Zhou Weihong, vice general manager of Shanghai-based Spring Travel, said the impact of the pandemic on operations is huge.
""Before the cross-province travel ban was lifted in mid July, business was basically frozen for half a year,"" she said.
During the pandemic, self-rescue became the buzz word for travel companies which turned to live-streaming to hawk deals or came up with suburban travel packages and promotion campaigns to encourage consumers to travel. 
The report also pointed out that China's lower tier cities had increasingly become a popular choice for local tourists, and that they have contributed a larger proportion to domestic tourism consumption.

Investing.com – China continued to tread a robust path towards economic recovery from COVID-19 in August, with retails sales growing for the first time in 2020 and industrial output accelerating the fastest in eight months.
Data released earlier in the day by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that retail sales increased 0.5% year-on-year, beating the forecast 0.1% growth prepared by Investing.com and July’s contraction of 1.1%. Meanwhile, industrial production increased 5.6% year-on-year, beating both its own forecast 5.1% growth and the 4.8% growth seen in July.
August's unemployment rate was 5.6%, against July’s 5.7%.
The Chinese economy saw pent-up demand, government stimulus and exports that have been surprisingly resilient fuel its recovery from the COVID-19-induced paralysis seen at the beginning of the year. Recent data, including trade, producer prices and factory activity, also all pointed to a continuous recovery.
“We think that China’s economic recovery is on a reasonably firm footing now and should continue through Q4 and into 2021, with solid investment growth, gradually recovering consumption momentum and resilient exports,” Oxford Economics’ Louis Kuijs told Reuters.
Consumer confidence also continues to increase, with an uptick in sales of automobiles and duty-free shopping. Confidence has also been boosted by government stimulus measures, as well as measures to keep COVID-19 under control in the country.
“Fiscal and monetary policy stimulus should continue to support the recovery. But we expect the impact of policy stimulus to lose some punch with credit growth easing in Q4,” Kuijs said.
But some investors struck a cautionary note over simmering U.S.-China tension, which could escalate in the run-up to November’s U.S. presidential elections.
NBS spokesman Fu Linghui warned during a briefing that the current economic recovery remains unbalanced given the still-fragile consumption and heightened external risks.
“Externally, there are still many unstable and uncertain factors. On the domestic side, in the process of economic recovery, some industries and enterprises are still facing difficulties, and the recovery is unbalanced,” Fu said.
The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, with over 29.1 million global cases as of September 15 according to Johns Hopkins University data. The possibility of fresh outbreaks in the winter are also increasing investor jitters."

Real estate investment in August rose 11.8% from a year earlier, quickening slightly from 11.7% seen in July, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday.
For January-August period, property investment grew 4.6% on an annual basis, faster than a 3.4% uptick in January-July.
China's property market was among the first to recover after the economy reopened this year, thanks to cheaper credit and a relaxation of urban residential curbs, with some analysts warning of a potential bubble in a handful of big cities.
But top government officials are keen to keep property prices in check, reiterating its overarching policy of ""houses are for living, not speculating"" and keeping most of its real estate curbs in cities across China in place. 
 Evergrande  (HK:3333), China's second-biggest property developer, stepped up price discounting this year to clear a growing pile of unsold homes. Property developers have faced sluggish demand in smaller cities as the pandemic hit people's incomes. 
Property sales by floor area rose 13.7% from a year earlier in August, faster than July's expansion of 9.5%, Reuters calculations showed.
However, growth in new construction starts measured by floor area eased to 2.4% in August, from the 11.3% increase in July.

Funds raised by China's property developers grew 3.0%, compared with a 0.8% growth for the first seven months of 2020.

1535,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2020 09:15PM ET</span>",New Zealand set to post deepest economic slump on record: Reuters poll,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand is set to record its sharpest quarterly contraction and officially enter recession when it releases second quarter economic data this week, reflecting the full impact of coronavirus lockdowns on business.
The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters showed GDP shrinking 12.8% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to June, following a 1.6% decline in the previous quarter.
That would put New Zealand in its first technical recession, defined as two straight quarters of contraction, since 2010, although an easing in coronavirus curbs has aided a quick recovery. GDP is expect to fall 13.3% year-on-year.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government, which faces an election on Oct. 17, has said there will be ""large drop"" in activity in the June quarter, but that success in suppressing the virus locally is likely to help recovery prospects.
New Zealand was the only country to stay free of COVID-19 for more than 100 days, largely due to a strict lockdown in April and some parts of May that forced almost everyone to stay at home and businesses to shut.
The measures battered economic activity, but it has since bounced back despite a second wave of infections in its biggest city, Auckland.
That has prompted some analysts to temper their gloomy forecasts, though they acknowledge the predictions are open to revisions as there was uncertainty around the measurement of data during the lockdown.
ANZ Bank cut its quarterly forecast to a 12% decline from 17.5%, but said the focus has shifted to the third quarter, which would bring ""the sharpest quarterly economic expansion we'll ever see.""
""Market forecasts have clearly been trending towards a smaller negative number in recent weeks, as the data showed that the economy bounced back readily from the lockdown,"" said Westpac Senior Economist Michael Gordon.

The central bank is expected to hold rates at its meeting on Sept 23 after re-affirming last month that the cash rate will remain at 0.25% until early 2021.

Reeve, previously the division's deputy director, replaces Thomas Laubach, who died earlier this month. 
Reeve, who holds a doctorate in economics from Harvard University, joined the Fed staff in 1998 and spent 16 years in the central bank's Division of International Finance, including a stint advising the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund.
He served as an adviser to both former Fed Chair Janet Yellen and current Chair Jerome Powell, and as deputy of the monetary affairs group beginning in 2018, according to the board website.
In announcing the appointment, Powell said Reeve's advice had been ""indispensable"" to him, and cited his ""wealth of experience in policy analysis and in facilitating the monetary policymaking process.""
The staff of the Fed's Washington-based Board of Governors is organized into 12 divisions covering areas from research and statistics to financial stability and legal matters.
Monetary affairs is at the heart of the policymaking process, with 170 staff who help guide the Fed on fundamental decisions like interest rates, bondbuying, and communications. The group was central to a Fed strategic review that ended with a heightened central bank commitment to stronger job growth.

The trough of the recession was reached in the second quarter and the easing of lockdown measures since May led to a rapid recovery in industry and in some service sectors, the ministry said in its monthly report on Monday, adding that the revival has lost some steam lately though.
""The German economy is continuing to pick up, albeit at a more moderate pace,"" the ministry said.
Economists expect Europe's biggest economy to show a return to growth in the third quarter after a record 9.7% contraction in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investment and exports all collapsed.
The ministry said significant economic growth was likely in the third quarter thanks to impetus from May and June, when there were signs of a rebound.
It said exports remained far from their pre-coronavirus levels and while industrial production had returned to almost 90% of its pre-coronavirus level and was continuing to rise, it had lost some momentum.
Earlier this month, the German government revised upward its economic forecast for this year to a decline of 5.8% from a previously expected slump of 6.3%.
A temporary cut in Germany's value-added tax (VAT) as part of the government's stimulus package and a child bonus are also expected to boost domestic demand in the second half of the year, it added.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 10:40PM ET</span>","China's new home prices growth steady, supports economic recovery","BEIJING (Reuters) - New home prices in China rose at a slightly faster monthly pace in August, as consumer demand showed signs of picking up in a boost to an economy recovering from the coronavirus crisis.
Average new home prices in 70 major cities climbed 0.6% in August from a month earlier, a touch better than a 0.5% increase in July, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday.
On an annual basis, home prices rose 4.8% in August, matching July's pace.
The property market has been a major driver in China's economic recovery, with home sales and investment growing at a robust pace in recent months after coronavirus lockdowns were lifted.
Yet policymakers remain wary about the risks of overheating, long one of the key balancing acts for authorities as they try to support a crucial sector of the economy without stoking excessive speculation. 
Since July, many major cities have imposed new restrictions on property transactions to arrest sharp price rises. Big provincial capitals Hangzhou and Shenyang also strengthened curbs on home purchases this month..
Most of the 70 cities surveyed by the NBS reported monthly price increases for new homes, with the number unchanged from 59 in July.
Tier-3 cities reported the strongest monthly gains. Huizhou, a small city in China southern Guangdong province which is close to Shenzhen, was the top performer in August, notching up a monthly price increase of 1.9%.
Regulators said last month they would institute new rules to control liquidity in the real estate market and are looking to contain property developers' debt levels to reduce risks to the financial system.
That has prompted indebted developers to cut prices to spur sales and cashflow. Analysts expect more developers would initiate sales promotion in the coming months, dubbed ""Golden September, Silver October"", a traditional sales peak season.
""Going forward, price cuts and sales promotion would be the main theme,"" said Yan Yuejin, director of the Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution.
""We do not rule out possibility that the home price increase will continue to narrow.""

New home prices in 70 major cities, excluding state-subsidized housing, rose 0.56% last month, compared to a 0.47% gain in July, National Bureau of Statistics data released Monday showed. Values in the secondary market, which is largely free from government intervention, gained 0.34%, compared with 0.26% in July.
Click here for more detail on the data
Policy makers have in recent months stepped up regulatory caution against developers’ leverage and excessive home-price growth, after frenetic buying spread from the country’s biggest cities to some booming regional centers. In August, cities including Nanjing and Wuxi followed Shenzhen in tightening home-purchase rules.
For now, a renewed fear of missing out on price increases and an urge to guard against anticipated inflation are sustaining housing demand. Credit growth rebounded more-than-expected in August as monetary-policy easing continues to take effect and support the recovery.
“So far, the property market is much stronger than our expectation,” Macquarie Securities Ltd.’s head of China economics Larry Hu said before the data release. “In the next few months, property sales may continue to recover.”

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers remain gloomy for 14th month - Reuters Tankan,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's manufacturers remained pessimistic for the 14th straight month in September, and though the gloom eased somewhat the broad results of the Reuters Tankan survey pointed to a painfully slow recovery for the coronavirus-stricken economy.
The result underlines the huge challenge the country's next leader succeeding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will face to boost growth and corporate and consumer sentiment after the economy sunk into its deepest recession on record.
Monday's poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's closely watched ""tankan"" quarterly survey, showed manufacturers' morale mirrored frail sales in key sectors such as auto and the construction industry.
""Sales for cars as well as construction machinery are not recovering,"" a manager of a transportation equipment maker wrote in the Reuters poll of 485 large- and mid-sized companies, in which 256 firms replied on condition of anonymity.
The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers inched up to minus 29 in September from minus 33 in the previous month, still deeply pessimistic even though it marked the least gloomiest level in six months.
The materials industries such as steel, nonferrous metals, textiles and paper put a drag on the overall sentiment index.
The service-sector index stood at minus 18, up from minus 23 in August, but sentiment among wholesalers, transport and utilities weighed on broad business confidence.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
The BOJ will hold its next policy review on Sept. 16-17, and release its next ""tankan"" survey results on Oct. 1.
The central bank was expected to offer a brighter view next week on the economy, output and exports than in July to signal that they were starting to recover from the COVID-19 crisis, sources familiar with its thinking said.
A manager at a machinery maker in the Reuters Tankan survey said that a sharp drop in demand from weak corporate activity due to virus-induced lockdown measures appeared to have bottomed out. ""A recovery will take time,"" the manager said.
Manufacturers' sentiment was seen recovering further to minus 19 in December, while that of service-sector firms was expected to tick up to minus 17.
""Our corporate performance is improving but it's unclear how long it will hold up,"" said another manager, at a rubber company said.

The Mexican economy has been especially hard hit by the pandemic, with health authorities confirming on Friday that the official death toll has surpassed 70,000, the fourth highest number of deaths globally.
The economy is seen contracting by up to 13% this year, the deepest downturn since the 1930s-era Great Depression.
Despite the modest August job gains, following several months of losses, the labor market has bled 833,100 formal jobs so far this year, according to IMSS data.
Formal jobs stem from contracts and include defined pay and tax obligations, while informal jobs mostly operate in cash and outside the law.

Slightly more than half of Mexican workers are thought to be employed informally.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has pushed the U.S. federal budget deficit above $3 trillion for the first 11 months of fiscal 2020, more than doubling the previous full-year record, the U.S. Treasury said on Friday.
The budget deficit for August was $200 billion, matching the deficit in August 2019 but lower than the $245 billion forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. However, $55 billion worth of benefit payments were shifted into July because August started on a weekend.
The $3.007 trillion year-to-date deficit was nearly triple the $1.067 trillion deficit for the comparable year-ago period, spurred by a massive increase in government spending to battle the economic fallout from the pandemic.
The previous 11-month deficit record was $1.37 trillion, reported by the Treasury in August 2009 during the financial crisis and recession. The full fiscal 2009 deficit totaled $1.4 trillion.
Concerns about ballooning deficits have stoked opposition by some Republicans in Congress to spending trillions of dollars more on a new round of coronavirus aid programs. This has helped to stall negotiations between Democrats and the Trump administration.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has projected the full-year 2020 U.S. deficit to reach $3.3 trillion, or 16% of GDP, the highest share since the end of World War Two.
August budget outlays were $423 billion, compared with $428 billion in August 2019 and $626 billion in July 2020. Labor- related outlays, largely unemployment benefits, fell to $55 billion in August from $110 billion in July after a $600-a-week federal unemployment supplement expired on July 31.
Receipts in August were $223 billion, compared with $228 billion in the year-earlier period. While taxes collected from paycheck withholdings fell by $11 billion from a year earlier, non-withheld tax payments were up $4 billion due to a processing backlog from the delayed July 15 tax deadline, a Treasury official said.
Earnings from the Federal Reserve soared in August by $5 billion compared with a year earlier from earnings on the Fed's massively expanded bond holdings and lower interest payments on bank reserves.
The Treasury's interest costs on public debt rose $7 billion in August compared with a year earlier as borrowing expanded massively. But debt costs were $53 billion lower for the first 11 months of 2020 versus a year earlier due to lower interest rates.

1544,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Used cars drive U.S. consumer prices higher; inflation pressures firming,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose solidly in August, with the cost of used cars and trucks accelerating by the most in more than 51 years likely as Americans shunned public transportation because of fears of contracting COVID-19. 
The report from the Labor Department on Friday also showed a firming in underlying inflation last month, putting fears of deflation to rest. Deflation, a decline in the general price level, is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices.
Still, stirring inflation is unlikely to discourage the Federal Reserve from pumping more money into the economy to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 recession amid considerable labor market slack. The U.S. central bank in August rewrote its framework, putting new emphasis on the labor market and less on worries about too-high inflation.
""Consumer prices are rebounding from the pandemic shock, but as supply shortages are resolved, upward price increases should moderate,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""The Fed's new policy objectives underscore that monetary policy will remain very accommodative for a considerable time."" 
The consumer price index increased 0.4% last month, also lifted by gains in the costs of gasoline, recreation and household furnishings and operations. The CPI advanced 0.6% in both June and July after falling in the prior three months as business closures to slow the spread of the coronavirus depressed demand.
In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 1.3% after gaining 1.0% in the 12 months through July.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would rise 0.3% in August and climb 1.2% on a year-on-year basis.
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI gained 0.4% last month after surging 0.6% in July, the largest gain since January 1991. A 5.4% jump in prices of used cars and trucks, the largest gain since March 1969, accounted for more than 40% of the rise in the so-called core CPI last month.
In the 12 months through August, the core CPI climbed 1.7% after rising 1.6% in July.
Though the Fed's embrace of what it calls ""flexible average inflation targeting"" is still shy of many details, in theory it could see policymakers tolerate price increases above its 2% target for a period of perhaps several years to offset years in which inflation was lodged below its goal.
Policymakers have expressed a range of ideas about how this might work in practice, but agree the aim is to let prices rise fast enough that household and businesses take their inflation target seriously. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 1.3% in the 12 months through July. August's core PCE price index data is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.
Some economists questioned the need for higher inflation as many households were struggling because of the pandemic.
""For the individual worker, rising inflation is not good news, no matter what the Fed thinks,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economics in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after pulling back in the previous session. The dollar (DXY) was slightly lower against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
BROAD PRICE INCREASES
Though food prices rocketed at the height of the COVID-19 business shutdowns, inflation stayed muted as the pandemic undercut demand for services like healthcare, air travel, dining out and hotel accommodation. High unemployment is also keeping a lid on price pressures despite the Fed's extraordinarily easy monetary policy and record fiscal stimulus from the government.
Nearly 30 million people are on unemployment benefits. 
Last month, gasoline prices rose 2.0% after increasing 5.6% in July. Food prices edged up 0.1% after declining 0.4% in July, the first decrease since April 2019. The cost of food consumed at home fell 0.1% after dropping 1.1% in the prior month.
Consumers paid less for beef as its price dropped 4.4%. But prices of dairy products rose 1.5%. The cost of food consumed away from home rose again.
Housing inflation cooled further amid forbearance agreements between tenants and landlords and a government moratorium on evictions. Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, nudged up 0.1%. That followed a 0.2% gain in July.
The cost of recreation rebounded 0.7% after falling in June and July. Prices for household furnishings and operations rose 0.9%, the largest increase since February 1991, likely due to more people working from home. Apparel prices rose 0.6%, advancing for a third straight month. The cost of motor vehicle insurance rose 0.5% and prices of airline fares increased 1.2%.

Healthcare costs gained 0.1% after rising 0.4% in July. But prescription medication prices fell 0.2%. New vehicle prices were unchanged. Education costs fell 0.3%, the first decline since the series started in 1993. Many schools and universities have shifted to online classes because of the pandemic.

(Reuters) - Consumer prices aren't rising fast enough to make inflation a major issue in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the latest data from the Labor Department suggests. In fact, the trend upwards is a sign the economy is recovering.
Still, Americans in the market for a new couch or a used car got a sticker-price sting last month. 
The index for the price of used cars and trucks rose 5.4% in August from the previous month, the fastest in more than 51 years, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Household furnishings rose 0.9%, the biggest monthly increase since February 1991.
Overall, the consumer price index rose 0.4% in August from July, and 1.3% from a year earlier.
That's tame, and unlikely to sway voters as they weigh their options for the Nov. 3 election. 
Republican presidential nominee Ronald Reagan seized on double-digit inflation in his 1980 challenge to then-President Jimmy Carter, telling voters it ""robbed"" them of the ability to plan for the future, and Reagan won in a landslide. 
Today, with the unemployment rate high and some 29 million Americans on some form of unemployment insurance, the fact that prices are rising as much as they are is the bigger surprise. 
""The price increases this time reflect low inventory – as demand is outstripping supply,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics. ""There has been a lot more upward pressure on prices than we would have expected given the extent of the collapse in the real economy.""

1546,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>","UK economy extends recovery from COVID crash, growth seen fading","By Andy Bruce and William Schomberg
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economy recovered half of its COVID-19 crash by the end of July, helped by pubs and restaurants reopening from lockdown, but the bounce-back is expected to slow as job losses mount and Brexit tensions rise.
After shrinking by a record 20% in the second quarter, output expanded by 6.6% in July, slower than June's monthly rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Friday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected growth of 6.7%.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak welcomed the figures but added that people were rightly worried about the coming months.
The economy remains 12% smaller than its level in February, before the pandemic hit Britain. 
""July was probably the last of the big step-ups in activity and a full recovery probably won't be achieved until early 2022,"" Thomas Pugh, an economist with Capital Economics, said.
In response, the Bank of England was likely to ramp up its bond-buying stimulus programme by a third, or 250 billion pounds ($320 billion), Pugh said.
Britain's economy suffered the sharpest second-quarter fall of any Group of Seven nation in the April-June period.
Hopes for a swift rebound have faded as businesses struggle to cope with social distancing rules and many people remain reluctant to travel on public transport or go to crowded places.
Tensions between London and Brussels over a post-Brexit trade deal are also mounting.
JOB PROTECTION CALLS
Furthermore, unemployment is expected to rise sharply because Sunak has ruled out extending his coronavirus job retention scheme which is due to expire at the end of October.
Parliament's Treasury Committee urged Sunak to ""carefully consider"" a targeted extension of the scheme and other support measures, a call echoed by the head of a major employers group.
Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry said she was in ""deep conversation"" with the government about a more selective version of the job subsidies scheme to avoid long-term job losses.
""We need to make sure that other countries, for example Germany, France, Australia, others who have put in place schemes like this, don't steal a march on our economy at this time,"" she told Sky News.
The pound fell slightly against the dollar as Friday's data showed output in Britain's dominant services sector was a bit weaker than expected. [GBP/] Growth in the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors exceeded forecasts.
Complicating the outlook, Brexit risks have resurfaced.
The European Union told Britain on Thursday it should scrap a plan to breach their divorce treaty, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government refused and pressed ahead with a draft law that could sink four years of talks.
""We are far from out of the woods yet,"" Tom Stevenson, Investment Director, Personal Investing, at Fidelity International said, pointing to rising COVID-19 infections, new rules on social gatherings and the end of the furlough scheme.

Gasoline prices rose 2.0% in August after increasing 5.6% in July. Food prices edged up 0.1% after declining 0.4% in July, the first decrease since April 2019. The cost of food consumed at home fell 0.1% after dropping 1.1% in the prior month. 
Owners' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, nudged up 0.1%. That followed a 0.2% gain in July. Many tenants have entered into forbearance agreements with landlords, while the government has temporarily halted evictions.

The cost of recreation increased 0.7% after falling in June and July. Prices for household furnishings and operations rose 0.9%, the largest increase since February 1991, with the costs of furniture and bedding advancing 1.6% and appliances rising 2.0%. Apparel prices rose 0.6%, advancing for a third straight month. The cost of motor vehicle insurance rose 0.5% and prices of airline fares increased 1.2%.

The Labor Department said on Friday its consumer price index rose 0.4% last month. The CPI advanced 0.6% in June and July after declining in the prior three months as business closures to slow the spread of the coronavirus depressed demand. 
In the 12 months through August, the CPI increased 1.3% after gaining 1.0% in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI rising 0.3% in August and climbing 1.2% year-on-year.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Services activity in Brazil rose in July for a second straight month, figures showed on Friday, but the pace of growth was slower than forecast, suggesting the economy's rebound from the worst of the COVID-19 may not be quite so entrenched.
The sector expanded by a seasonally-adjusted 2.6% from the previous month, government statistics agency IBGE said, less than the 3.1% rate of growth economists in a Reuters poll had forecast. 
Services sector output in July was down 11.9% from a year ago, IBGE said, more than the 10.4% decline forecast in the Reuters poll.
Four of the five sectors surveyed by IBGE showed increases in activity from the previous month, most notably a 2.2% rise in information and communications services, and a 2.3% increase in transport and transport-related services, IBGE said.
After surging 12.2% in June, services provided to families fell 3.9% in July, IBGE said.
June's rate of expansion in the services sector was revised up slightly to 5.2% from 5.0%. The figures mean that in the first seven months of the year, services sector activity in Latin America's largest economy fell 8.9% from the same period in 2019, IBGE said.

The level of service sector activity is still 22.2% lower than the peak in November 2014, IBGE said.

(Reuters) - The still-sky-high number of Americans who lost work during the coronavirus crisis and continue to tap unemployment insurance would normally be a troubling sign for a U.S. president seeking reelection, but maybe not this year. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits remained at a seasonally adjusted 884,000 for the week ended Sept. 5, Labor Department data https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf showed on Thursday, the same number as a week before and a bit more than economists expected.
All told, some 29.6 million Americans were relying on some form of unemployment insurance as of Aug. 22. That figure equates to a little under a fifth of the total number of jobs supported by the U.S. economy in February, before the current economic crisis hit.
""10.6 MILLION jobs added in four months,"" the White House tweeted after the release of the latest jobless claims report, which does not measure jobs added. ""That's the Great American Comeback!""
Graphic: Jobless claims still elevated - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-JOBLESS/azgponxegvd/chart.png
A Labor Department report last Friday showed U.S. employers added 10.6 million jobs from April through August. That is less than half the 22 million jobs lost in the first two months of the coronavirus-triggered recession. 
Still, if the stall in the labor market's recovery helps push a deadlocked U.S. Congress toward agreement on a new package of relief for households hit by the crisis, the extra aid could bolster support for the political status quo and lift President Donald Trump's chances of beating Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 election, according to Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor.
""The reality is that millions of Americans either unemployed or financially on the edge from pandemic-related losses and financial relief is a very present and urgent need,"" he said.

""In a normal election year, a financial stimulus package that puts thousands of dollars in the pockets of Americans and boosts the economy heading into November would seem like a clear political winner. However, as this year has repeatedly shown, normal rules of engagement may not apply during a global pandemic,"" Zhao said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People flocked to stores - and back to restaurants - over Labor Day weekend in the United States, setting post-pandemic highs for retail foot traffic and seated dining but also posing a puzzle. 
The upturn may be a sign that consumer confidence is returning alongside a fall in new coronavirus infections. Or it could be a one-time bright spot in a slow economic recovery that remains challenged by massive joblessness and a persistent health crisis, one many fear will intensify in coming weeks.
Broad measures of the recovery ticked higher over the last week, gross domestic product estimates kept by the Atlanta and New York Federal Reserve banks have been increasing since mid-summer, and high frequency indicators from private data services have shown steady if sometimes slow progress.
Graphic: NY Fed Weekly Economic Index - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/WEI/xklpyzdyyvg/chart.png
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) economist Jan Hatzius said Sept. 8 he was ""upbeat"" about the direction of the global economic recovery, and saw annualized third-quarter growth in the United States hitting 35% - far higher than the median of roughly 20% seen by forecasters in a Philadelphia Federal Reserve bank survey in mid-August.
Hatzius noted that even challenged service sector businesses ""are adapting to the pandemic via low-cost mitigation measures,"" a fact that may have contributed to some signs of progress for the beleaguered restaurant industry.
Data on seated diners provided by restaurant booking site OpenTable https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry as of Sunday were just 14% below 2019, a level not seen since before a state of emergency was declared March 13 and a wave of mandated closures and social distancing protocols temporarily shut down restaurants and other close-contact industries.
Graphic: Retail in real time - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/REOPEN/yzdvxxyzlvx/chart.png
Retail traffic overall has moved back to its March 1 level, according to data on cellphone locations provided by Safegraph https://www.safegraph.com/dashboard/covid19-commerce-patterns. Similar data from Unacast https://www.unacast.com/covid19/covid-19-retail-impact-scoreboard showed retail traffic had returned to year-ago levels in a pandemic-era record 33 states based on analysis through Saturday.
That momentum, however, may not be translating fully to the job market - a possible sign that the ""adaptation"" Hatzius highlighted is businesses learning to get by with fewer workers.
Initial jobless claims for the week ending Sept. 5 were unchanged from the week before, at 884,000, and the total number of people claiming some form of unemployment benefit increased by 380,000, to a staggering 29.6 million for the week ended Aug. 22. 
The headline unemployment rate has fallen faster than expected to 8.4%, and has been declining more quickly than after the 2007 to 2009 recession. But that overlooks the 3.7 million who have left the labor force altogether since February and so are not counted as unemployed, and hundreds of thousands on ""temporary"" furloughs that may turn permanent, Jason Furman, former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers and Harvard Kennedy School research associate Wilson Powell, wrote in an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
A ""realistic"" unemployment rate is more likely near 10%, they wrote.
""Labor market problems are very deep...Even if individuals on temporary layoff returned to work very quickly, the United States would still have a recessionary level of unemployment for some time to come,"" their analysis says.
Narrower measures of job recovery have been stodgy. Employment over the past week fell at small businesses whose time records are managed by Homebase https://joinhomebase.com/data, an online scheduling tool, many of them restaurants. New job postings culled from company and other websites by Chmura http://www.chmuraecon.com/blog Economics also dropped. 
Shifts worked at a broad set of industries whose worker time is managed by Kronos https://www.kronos.com/about-us/newsroom/update-us-workforce-activity continued a slow weekly pace of growth, stalled below 1% and with only about half of the estimated jobs recovered since massive rounds of layoffs and furloughs in the spring.

More challenging times may lie ahead. The virus has infected 6.3 million and killed more than 190,000 in the United States, according to a Reuters tally https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-USA/0100B5K8423/index.html. 
The growth in new coronavirus cases and deaths has been falling steadily since midsummer, and the improving health outcomes have boosted an Oxford http://blog.oxfordeconomics.com/topic/recovery-tracker Economics Recovery index back above 80 for the first time since the state of emergency.
Graphic: Oxford Economics Recovery Index - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ECONOMY/OXFORDINDEX/rlgpdlnyepo/chart.png
The issue now is whether a new wave of infections is coming, given the combination of Labor Day crowds, infection hot spots at college campuses, and the onset of cooler weather driving people back to less-safe indoor activities. 
Budget stresses at state and local governments, and the loss of household income as unemployment benefits expire could both lead to a crash in consumer spending absent further federal aid, many economists fear.
""The economic situation remains worrisome,"" Oxford analysts wrote. ""With one out of two laid-off workers still unemployed and Congress in deadlock over urgently needed fiscal support, a battered labor market and lackluster demand have brought the speed and durability of the recovery into question.""

The producer price index for final demand rose 0.3% last month after surging 0.6% in July, the Labor Department said on Thursday. In the 12 months through August, the PPI fell 0.2% after dropping 0.4% in the 12 months through July.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI would gain 0.2% in August and fall 0.3% on a year-on-year basis.
Producer prices were led by a 0.5% increase in services. Nearly 20% of the rise in services was attributed to
a 1.1% increase in margins for machinery, equipment, parts, and supplies wholesaling. Prices for goods edged up 0.1%. 
Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices rose 0.3% in August, advancing by the same margin for three straight months. In the 12 months through August, the core PPI gained 0.3%. The core PPI edged up 0.1% on a year-on-year basis in July.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits totaled a seasonally adjusted 884,000 for the week ended Sept. 5, matching the number of applications received in the prior week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 846,000 applications in the latest week.
Though claims have dropped from a record 6.867 million at the end of March, layoffs persist across industries as many companies have exhausted loans from the government to help with wages and the coronavirus lingers. A weekly unemployment supplement, credited for the sharp rebound in economic activity, starting with record retail sales growth in May, lapsed in July.
Airlines, including United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL) have announced furloughs and job cuts. There have also been layoffs at oilfield services and equipment companies.
Economists believe the labor market could take years to return to its pre-pandemic levels and are urging the White House and Congress to restart stalled negotiations for another rescue package amid a setback in the quest for a vaccine. 
AstraZeneca (L:AZN) has paused global trials of its experimental coronavirus vaccine, which has been described by the World Health Organization as probably the world's leading candidate and the most advanced in terms of development, after an unexplained illness in a participant.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits came in at a larger than forecast 884,000 last week, indicating that labor market recovery is stalling amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Economists had forecast a decline to 846,000. The prior week's figure was revised up to 884,000 from an initially reported 881,000.
Because of a change to how seasonal adjustments are calculated made earlier in the month, today's figure is only comparable to the previous week.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2020 04:05AM ET</span>",Zombies or just sleeping? German insolvencies fall despite pandemic,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The number of firms declaring insolvency in Germany was 6.2% lower than in the first half of last year despite the coronavirus crisis, the Statistics Office said, partly because of a rule designed to keep firms afloat in the pandemic.
In March, the government gave companies that find themselves in financial trouble due to the pandemic a respite by allowing them to delay filing for bankruptcy. That was later extended until the end of the year.
The fact that insolvency numbers fell even as Europe's largest economy shrank the most in its post-war history will lend ammunition to critics who say that suspending compulsory insolvencies is merely keeping afloat ""zombie companies"" whose collapse has merely been delayed, not prevented.
There were 9,006 corporate insolvencies in the first half of 2020, a sixth of them in the retail sector, which was especially hard-hit by lockdowns to stem the virus's spread. Construction and hospitality also notched up more than 1,000 insolvencies.
Companies that had declared insolvency had total estimated debts of 16.7 billion euros, up from 10.2 billion euros in the first half of 2019.
""The economic pain many companies have suffered in the coronavirus crisis is not so far reflected in the number of declared insolvencies,"" the Office said on Thursday. ""One reason is that the obligation to declare insolvency has been suspended since March 1.""
Germany's economy shrank by an unprecedented 9.7% in the second quarter, a contraction that without government countermeasures would ordinarily have been accompanied by a wave of bankruptcies and mass unemployment.

Defenders of the insolvency protection measures say they have helped spare Germany a yet more serious dip in economic output and helped prevent a disastrous spike in unemployment.

BEIJING (Reuters) - New energy vehicle (NEV) sales in China surged 26% on year to 109,000 units in August for their second consecutive month of gain, a promising sign for automakers that have invested heavily in the world's biggest market for electric vehicles (EVs).
For the full year, NEV sales are likely to reach 1.1 million vehicles, down around 11% from last year, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) on Thursday.
NEVs include battery-powered electric, plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.
""The sales rebound was fuelled by rural NEV sales promotion events and local governments' support,"" said senior CAAM official Chen Shihua.
EV makers from home-grown Nio Inc (N:NIO) and  Xpeng Inc  (N:XPEV) to U.S. leader Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) are expanding manufacturing capacity in China where the government heavily promotes greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution.
""There was a new-car effect in August, as a new mini EV model from GM's local venture and Tesla's Model 3 both sold well,"" said senior LMC Automotive analyst Alan Kang. ""Sales at EV startups like Nio and Xpeng were stable too.""
NEV sales in coming months will be around same as in August, Kang said.
China's overall auto sales in August rose 11.6% to 2.19 million vehicles from the same month a year earlier, the fifth consecutive month of gain as China comes off lows hit during the coronavirus lockdown in the first few months of the year.
Sales are still down 9.7% for the first eight months of the year at 14.55 million vehicles, CAAM said.
Sales of trucks and other commercial vehicles, which constitute around a quarter of the market, surged 41.6%, driven by government investment in infrastructure and as buyers upgraded to comply with tougher emissions rules.
Sales of passenger vehicles rose 6%.

Automakers that reported sales growth in August include Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203). The main local joint ventures of Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) and General Motors Co (N:GM), however, saw sales slide last month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's machinery orders rebounded in July from a sharp fall in the previous month, a welcome relief for the coronavirus-stricken economy but the outlook for capital spending remained uncertain due to fragile global business conditions.
Corporate Japan is facing strains from steep declines in earnings, discouraging business investment as the economy grapples with its worst postwar slump. 
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, grew 6.3% in July after a 7.6% decline in June.
The rise was bigger than a 1.9% gain seen by economists in a Reuters poll.
""Corporate earnings are likely to remain in a sluggish state in the second half of the fiscal year,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. 
Orders from manufacturers advanced 5.0%, while those from non-manufacturers gained 3.4%, the Cabinet Office data showed on Thursday.
The government maintained its assessment on machinery orders to say they were on a decreasing trend.
Overseas orders rose for the first time in five months, gaining 13.8% in July from the previous month to highlight a pickup in external demand.
From a year earlier, core machinery orders were down 16.2% in July, not far off an expected 18.3% decline.
The world's third-largest economy is preparing for a new prime minister for the first time in nearly eight years after Shinzo Abe announced his resignation last month due to poor health.
The country's next leader will face the daunting task of fighting the economic, social and medical fallout from the health crisis while pulling the country out of its worst postwar recession.
The government has already rolled out a combined $2.2 trillion of fiscal stimulus packages to combat the pandemic, adding to an enhanced programme from the Bank of Japan.
The central bank will hold its next policy review on Sept. 16-17.
Tom Learmouth, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said he still expected non-residential investment to weaken a little further in the third-quarter despite the uptick in July orders.
""With domestic capital goods shipments falling to their lowest level since 2011 in July, we think business investment weakened further in Q3,"" he wrote in a note.

The monthly gauge of house prices from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) shot up to +44 in August from +13 in July, hitting its level since February 2016. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of +25.
Prices rose across the country except for London where they have remained more or less flat over the past two months.
The survey chimed with other signs that a mini-boom is underway in the housing market - one of the few parts of the economy to have bounced back from the pandemic - helped in part by an emergency tax cut for buyers.
Demand accelerated sharply, helped by a shift towards properties with gardens after the COVID-19 lockdown, RICS said.
Some 83% said they expected to see higher demand for properties with gardens and most predicted reduced demand for homes in highly urban areas or tower blocks.
""The latest RICS survey provides firm evidence of a strong uplift in activity in the housing market which should help support the wider economy gain traction over the coming months,"" RICS chief economist Simon Rubinsohn said.
Still, there were some ominous signs.
The survey's gauge of sales for the next 12 months deteriorated further in August, dented by worries about the economy.

Last week Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said it was too soon to say if the rebound in the housing market was anything more than a release of pent-up demand following lockdown, helped by the temporary cut to property taxes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings increased further in July, though more workers quit their jobs in the retail as well as professional and business services industries likely because of fears of exposure to COVID-19 and problems with childcare.
Despite the surge in vacancies reported by the Labor Department on Wednesday in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, the number of unemployed people competing for a new job remained relatively high in July. 
""The labor market recovery will be measured in years, not months,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.
Job openings, a measure of labor demand, jumped 617,000 to 6.6 million on the last day of July. Still, vacancies remain below their level of 7 million in February. 
Job openings were led by the retail sector, with 172,000 new vacancies. There were an additional 146,000 jobs in healthcare and social assistance. In the construction industry, job openings increased by 90,000. The job openings rate shot up to 4.5%, the highest since October 2019, from 4.2% in June.
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data.
The number of people voluntarily quitting their jobs increased 344,000 to 2.9 million. There were 152,000 workers who quit their jobs in the retail sector. In the professional and business services sector, 98,000 workers left. State and local government education reported 35,000 workers quit in July.

CHILDCARE CHALLENGES
While schools have opened for the new academic year, many are conducting virtual classes. Problems securing childcare have forced some workers, mostly women, to resign from their jobs. The labor participation rate for women dropped in April to levels last seen in the late 1980s and has not rebounded much since.
The quits rate, which under normal circumstance is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence, increased to 2.1% in July from 1.9% in June.
""More quits during the pandemic are probably a reflection of virus fear and challenges related to childcare given the current weak state of the labor market,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
The JOLTS report followed on the heels of news last Friday that the economy created 1.371 million jobs in August after adding 1.734 million in July. About 10.6 million of the 22.2 million jobs lost at the depth of the coronavirus pandemic have been recovered.
In July, there were 2.5 people per job opening.
The JOLTS report showed hiring dropped by 1.183 million jobs to 5.8 million in July. Hiring decreased by 599,000 jobs in the accommodation and food services sector. It fell by 137,000 in the healthcare and social assistance industry. 
But federal government hiring increased by 33,000, largely because of recruitment for the 2020 Census.
Overall, the hiring rate fell to 4.1% from 5.1% in June. 
Layoffs abated in July, declining 274,000 to 1.7 million, the lowest since March 2019. There were decreases in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, utilities and wholesale trade industries. 
Though layoffs as measured by the number of new claims for unemployment benefits remain elevated, economists believe the worst of the job cuts related to the pandemic is likely over.

""It remains difficult to understand why various measures related to layoffs have sent different signals in recent months, but several of the key measures suggest that we have moved past the worst of the layoffs associated with the virus spread,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) in New York.

1561,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 09, 2020 10:27AM ET</span>",U.S. Job Openings Increased in July by More Than Forecast,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. job openings increased for a third straight month in July, consistent with a steady improvement in the labor market as the nation grinds its way forward from a pandemic-induced recession.
The number of available positions rose to 6.62 million during the month from a revised 6 million in June, according to the Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, released Wednesday. The figure exceeded all projections in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Openings that involve workers recalled from layoffs or positions that are only offered internally are not counted in the figure.
Competition among those looking for work remains elevated with a little more than 16 million Americans jobless in July, leaving about 2.5 unemployed workers vying for every job opening. That stands in stark contrast to a two-year trend in which job vacancies exceeded the number of unemployed.
The number of hires, which does include rehired employees, declined 1.18 million to a still-solid 5.79 million in July. The hires rate decreased to 4.1% from 5.1%.
Separations, which include layoffs and quits, rose by 108,000 in July, reflecting an increase in the number of people voluntarily leaving their jobs. The number of quits jumped to 2.95 million from 2.61 million a month earlier. The quits rate increased to 2.1%, edging closer to where it was at the start of the year, when the unemployment rate was at its lowest in decades. The rate of layoffs and discharges dropped to 1.2% in July from 1.4%.
The increase in job openings, which occurred in all four U.S. regions, reflected a 217,000 gain in vacancies within trade, transportation and utilities. Openings also picked up in construction, education and health care, manufacturing and business services. They fell within leisure and hospitality, which continues to suffer from declining demand related to the pandemic.
Employers added to payrolls at a steady rate in August, indicating companies are continuing to adjust headcounts against a backdrop of firmer demand, the agency’s latest monthly jobs data showed Friday.
The JOLTS data lag behind the monthly employment report by a month, but it offers a level of detail not available in the jobs report. However, the two are not directly comparable across all categories.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Dubai Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.9 in August from 51.7 in July, slightly above the mark that separates growth from contraction.
In June the index was at 50.0, emerging from three consecutive months of contraction.
""Dubai's non-oil economy saw a disappointing slowdown in growth in August, as the PMI fell for the first time since April,"" said David Owen, economist at survey complier IHS Markit.
""Firms have not seen a full-scale uplift in demand to pre-pandemic levels and many commented that market conditions remained strongly depressed.""
The Middle East's trade and tourism hub relies on foreign visitors and shoppers for a large chunk of revenue and was hit hard by virus containment measures.
Output expanded for the third consecutive month in August, though at the slowest pace in that period, falling to 52.7 from 56.1 in July.
Employment contracted for the sixth straight month and was largely in line with the average in that period, falling to 46.0 in August from 46.8 in July, as companies cut jobs and employee costs.
""Business optimism weakened, with some firms expecting activity to improve but others citing that the unpredictability of the recovery could lead to business closures,"" Owen said.
The non-oil private sector in the United Arab Emirates - of which Dubai is a part - contracted in August for the first time since May, hit by record job cuts that reversed the growth of the previous two months as coronavirus restrictions were lifted.

Annual producer prices fell for a seventh straight month but at a slower pace, while consumer prices saw more moderate growth due to falling pork price inflation. Core consumer prices however rose month-on-month for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic worsened in China in January.
China's economy returned to growth in the second quarter of this year, underpinned by government stimulus and as the country managed to get the virus broadly under control. Recent indicators have pointed to a sustained recovery.
""Looking through the volatility in food prices, the broader disinflationary impact from the COVID-19 downturn continues to ease,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics.
The producer price index (PPI) fell 2.0% from a year earlier in August, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Wednesday. That was in line with expectations in a Reuters poll, but the decline was more modest than the 2.4% drop in July. 
The consumer price index meanwhile rose 2.4% last month from a year earlier, as expected, but slower than a 2.7% annual increase in July, as food price inflation eased, driven by pork prices.
Pork price inflation slowed last month from a higher base a year ago, when prices began to surge in August 2019 as the African swine fever decimated China's pig herd. Pork prices rose 52.6% in August from a year earlier, easing sharply from a 85.7% annual jump in July.
""Looking ahead, headline consumer price inflation probably has further to fall as pork supply continues to recover from last year's African swine fever outbreak,"" Evans-Pritchard added.
UNCERTAINTY STILL ""HUGE""
Core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.5% in August from a year earlier, unchanged from July, suggesting domestic demand still remained soft.
On a month-on-month basis, core inflation rose 0.1% in August, the first monthly rise since January, while producer prices rose 0.3%, slowing from 0.4 % in July.
""In August, industrial production continued to improve while market demand kept recovering,"" said Dong Lijuan, senior statistician with the NBS, in a statement accompanying the data release.
But Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust, does not expect annual PPI to turn positive by the end of the year. 

""(It) would ultimately depend on when the global pandemic will be brought under control. Given China is very likely to see a resurgence of infections during winter, the uncertainty (on the industrial recovery) is still huge.""

“In August, industrial production continued to improve while market demand kept recovering,” NBS senior statistician Dong Lijuan said in a statement.
“Prices for global commodities such as crude oil, iron ore and non-ferrous metals continued to rise, driving a rebound in domestic factory-gate prices,” he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's currency in circulation and bank deposits rose at a record annual pace in August as companies and households continued to pile up cash to guard against the coronavirus- driven income slump, central bank data showed on Wednesday.
The data underlines the difficulty of prodding companies and households to start spending again, even as the economy gradually re-opens after lockdown measures were lifted in May.
Japan's M3 money stock - or currency in circulation and deposits at financial institutions - rose 7.1% in August from a year earlier, marking the biggest increase since comparable data became available in 2004, Bank of Japan data showed. The rise topped a 6.5% gain in July.
Bank deposits surged a record 15.3% in August from a year earlier, as the hit to sales from COVID-19 prompted companies to continue to hoard cash as a precaution.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports remained far below their pre-crisis levels in July despite a 4.7% increase during the month, data published on Tuesday showed, adding to signs that Germany's economic recovery from the coronavirus will be slow.
Imports rose by only 1.1% on the month, taking the seasonally adjusted trade surplus to 18 billion euros, the Federal Statistics Office said.
Economists expect Europe's biggest economy to show a return to growth in the third quarter, helped by higher activity levels domestically and in some of Germany's main trading partners after lockdowns were lifted from April.
Yet weak demand from major economic peers still grappling with the pandemic, such as the United States, is holding back a stronger recovery.
The data showed that exports to the United States were 17% lower in July year-on-year. Exports to China, however, which is experiencing a more pronounced recovery than the United States, were only 0.1% lower.
""While today's numbers are good news for our call of surging GDP growth .... (in the second half of the year) and suggest that the export sector is flourishing again, we should not get carried away by these numbers,"" said Carsten Brzeski, euro zone chief economist at ING.
He added: ""They are still part of the mechanical rebound. In fact, the German export sector is still suffering from structural challenges including trade tensions, Brexit and global supply chain disruptions as well as difficulties among its main trading partners to cope with the virus.""
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investment and trade all collapsed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Exports were in July still more than 12% lower than in February.
Trade tensions, uncertainties linked to Britain's departure from the European Union and an automotive sector struggling to adapt to electrification had suppressed demand for German goods and services before the pandemic, setting off a recession in the manufacturing sector.
The COVID-19 crisis makes a full recovery difficult.

The VDMA business association said on Tuesday that German engineering firms expected production to decline by 17% this year before growing by only 2% in 2021 - barring both a second coronavirus wave and resurgent trade disputes.

Data out later in the morning is expected to show the economy shrank more than previously estimated in the second quarter as the health crisis delivered a blow to capital spending, in a sign of the challenge policymakers face in avoiding a deeper recession.
Labour ministry data on Tuesday showed inflation-adjusted real wages, a key gauge of households' purchasing power, declined 1.6% in July from a year earlier, following a downwardly revised 2.1% drop the previous month.
Overtime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, dropped 16.6% in July from a year earlier, down for the 11th straight month, while nominal total cash earnings dropped 1.3% in the year to July.
Regular pay - or base salary, which makes up most of total cash earnings - saw a modest increase, growing 0.3%, which was smaller than June's downwardly revised 0.4% gain.

Barclaycard said its measure of spending rose in annual terms for the first time since before the lockdown, up 0.2% year-on-year as people bought more fuel to go on holiday in Britain and to begin returning to their workplaces.
There was also an increase in spending in restaurants, pubs and bars as diners took advantage of the government's Eat Out to Help Out"" discount scheme that run during August.
The overall increase was the first since February. Spending on clothing rose for the first time since March 2019 as people ventured back to shops.
By contrast, spending on travel – including airlines and travel agents – slumped by 61%.
Britain's economy suffered a record 20% contraction in the April-June period before recovering a bit in May and June. Its prospects depend in large part on how confident households are about getting back to something resembling normal life.
""It's encouraging to see the first uplift in spending after such a turbulent time for retailers,"" Raheel Ahmed, head of consumer products at Barclaycard, said.
However, a surge in online orders meant the recovery might be a long one for bricks-and-mortar stores.
Economists are also warning that unemployment will rise sharply as the government scales back its job protection scheme.
Separately, the British Retail Consortium said spending at retailers rose by 3.9% compared with August 2019, the biggest increase in more than two years excluding distortions caused by the timing of Easter.
The shift to working from home boosted sales of food, computing, furniture and televisions, the BRC said.
But many retailers who rely on commuters were at risk of closure if people continue to stay away from offices and other places of work, BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German industrial output rose far less than expected in July, suggesting Europe's largest economy faces a slow return to production levels that preceded the crisis unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Industrial output rose by 1.2% on the month, a third successive increase after record drops in March and April during a lockdown, figures released on Monday by the Statistics Office showed. A Reuters poll had forecast an increase of 4.7%.
A breakdown of the data showed that activity in the construction sector, which had expanded during the lockdown, shrank by 4.3%, dragging on the headline figure.
The automotive sector, which before the crisis was grappling with falling demand and an expensive shift to electric vehicles, saw activity expand by almost 7% month-on-month but production levels were still around 15% lower than in February.
""The German economy remains on track for a strong surge in the third quarter,"" said Carsten Brzeski, chief euro zone economist at ING. ""It is too early to tell how much momentum will be left thereafter.""
Even excluding the volatile construction and energy sectors, output rose by 2.8%, still lower than the forecast.
The Germany economy has weathered the pandemic much better than many of its big European neighbours, largely because the country kept factories open during a six-week lockdown. The government has also put in place a massive stimulus package.
A strong rebound in activity in May and June raised hopes of a fast recovery but economists now mostly predict a slow return to pre-crisis activity levels.
Industrial firms expect production to increase slightly in the coming months, according to a survey published on Monday by the Ifo economic institute.
Industry orders data published last week showed that domestic demand had fallen by more than 10% in July.
""With the latest data showing a small fall in domestic orders in August, while activity is losing momentum elsewhere in Europe, the economic recovery looks set to be moving into a more difficult, slower phase,"" Jack Allen-Reynolds of Capital Economics wrote in a note.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rose for the third consecutive month in August, eclipsing an extended fall in imports, as more of its trading partners relaxed coronavirus lockdowns in a further boost to the recovery in the world's second-biggest economy.
Exports in August rose a solid 9.5% from a year earlier, customs data showed on Monday, marking the strongest gain since March 2019. The figure also beat analysts' expectations for 7.1% growth and compared with a 7.2% increase in July. 
Imports however slumped 2.1%, compared with market expectations for a 0.1% increase and extending a 1.4% fall in July. 
The strong exports suggest a faster and more balanced recovery for the Chinese economy, which is rebounding from a record first-quarter slump thanks largely to domestic stimulus measures
""China’s exports continue to defy expectations and to grow significantly faster than global trade, thus gaining global market share,"" said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics.
A private survey on manufacturing activity last week showed Chinese factories reported the first increase in new export orders this year in August as overseas demand slowly revives. The pick-up in business also led to a further expansion in production, marking the sharpest gain in almost a decade.
China's export performance, boosted by record shipments of medical supplies and robust demand for electronic products, has not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared.
All the same, some analysts cautioned that the stronger exports reflected in part the base effects of the year-ago weakness. 
Imports unexpectedly slipped further into contraction, suggesting softer domestic demand.
But imports were largely stable in terms of volume, said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics, in a note. 
""With credit growth still accelerating and infrastructure-led stimulus still ramping up, import volumes should remain strong in the coming months,"" he said. 
Copper imports in August eased from the previous month's all-time high, as an arbitrage window to bring in overseas metal shut and demand from key consumption sectors slowed. Coal imports slipped 20.8% from the month before. Iron ore imports fell 10.9% from July but rose from a year earlier on resilient demand for steel.
China posted a trade surplus of $58.93 billion last month, compared with the poll's forecast for a $50.50 billion surplus and $62.33 billion surplus in July. 
OUTLOOK STILL UNCERTAIN
The outlook is still far from rosy as external demand could suffer if virus control measures have to be re-imposed by trade partners later this year on a resurgence of the epidemic. 
China also is looking to reduce its reliance on overseas markets for its development as U.S. hostility and the pandemic increase external risks that could hamper longer-term progress.
Already heightened U.S.-China tensions are expected to escalate ahead of the U.S. presidential election. China remains well behind on its pledge to boost purchases of U.S. goods under an agreement that was launched in February.
China's trade surplus with the United States widened to $34.24 billion in August from $32.46 billion in July. 
Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal in a phone call last month. ""Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,"" the U.S. Trade Representative's office said.
Falling imports of integrated circuits in August are likely the result of the new restrictions on U.S. companies doing businesses with Chinese technology companies, said Iris Pang, chief economist for Greater China at ING, in a note. 

Bilateral tensions could also affect exports of technological products and services in the coming months, she said.

Investing.com – China saw exports rise for a third consecutive month, but also saw an extended fall in imports, with loosening global lockdown measures boosting the country’s economic recovery from COVID-19.
Customs data for August released earlier in the day said that exports increased 9.5% year-on-year, beating Investing.com's 7.1% forecast, as well as July’s 7.2% increase. However, imports fell 2.1% year-on-year, bigger than the forecast 0.1% drop and the 1.4% drop from the the previous month.
The increase in exports, attributable to record shipments of medical supplies and increased demand for electronics, suggested a faster and more balanced recovery for the world’s second largest economy, and a continuing rebound from the record slump seen in the first quarter due to strict lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.
The Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), released during the previous week, also saw the first increase in new export orders this year for Chinese factories, with loosing lockdown measures slowly reviving demand outside China.
“China’s exports continue to defy expectations and to grow significantly faster than global trade, thus gaining global market share,” Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics told Reuters.
But he warned, “The import data disappointed, pointing to the need for caution as we assess growth of China’s domestic demand.”
However, a resurgence of COVID-19 could mean tighter control measures, such as the reimposition of lockdowns, and impact the growth in exports.
Meanwhile, the trade balance stood at $58.93 billion, higher than the forecast $50.50 billion but lower than July’s $62.33 billion figure. Simmering U.S.-China tensions ahead of the U.S. presidential elections mean that China is looking to reduce its dependence on exports and overseas markets. China’s trade surplus with the United States jumped to $34.24 billion in August from July’s $32.46 billion, indicating that China remains behind on its pledge to boost purchases of U.S. goods under the agreement between the two countries launched in February.
However, U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal in a phone call in August, “Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,” according to U.S. Trade Representative’s office. During the previous week, the U.S. extended tariff exclusions for a wide range of Chinese goods, including smartwatches and some medical masks, through the end of 2020."

Exports rose 9.5% in dollar terms in August from a year earlier, while imports fell 2.1%, the customs administration said Monday. That left a trade surplus of $58.9 billion for the month. Economists had forecast exports would increase by 7.5% and imports would rise 0.2%.

1584,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 06, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",Jobs Report Sends Mixed Messages for Lawmakers and Markets,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The much-anticipated U.S. jobs report on Friday answered some important questions about the state of the labor market. Yet by also leaving some important issues outstanding, it will not serve as the much needed outside catalyst to resolve both the policy stalemate on Capitol Hill and the increasingly visible tug-of-war in financial markets.
The narrow message of the jobs report came through loud and clear in four monthly numbers. Despite all the headwinds facing the economy, its inherent dynamism and entrepreneurship — plus a positive one-off influence from census hiring — led to buoyant job creation (1.4 million) and a sharp fall in the unemployment rate (from 10.2% to 8.4%). This was coupled with an increase in both labor force participation and the equally important employment-to-population ratio.
Pulling the lens back a bit provided a second, less reassuring message. The pace of improvement in the labor market continues to moderate. Monthly job creation has fallen from a three-month average of 3 million after gains resumed in the wake of the economic sudden stop in March related to the Covid-19 shock to monthly rates of 1.7 million in July and 1.4 million in August.
This is an issue because of the third, more macro message in the jobs report. The overall labor market situation remains worrisome. Almost 30 million Americans depend on some form of unemployment assistance at a time when the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that the share of the long-term unemployed is growing.
These three different messages are problematic when it comes to breaking the stalemate in the fiscal policy debate in Washington. Both Democrats and Republicans will find enough in the jobs report to support their competing positions on the relief bill languishing in Congress. For Republicans who favor a smaller relief package, the report’s favorable narrow message provides ammunition, especially because the unemployment rate was yet another data point that beat the consensus expectations of economists and Wall Street analysts last week. Democrats will point to the other two messages to press for a much bigger relief package.
A similar tension exists in financial markets as a result of the tug-of-war between investors who are thinking in relative terms and those starting to look more closely at absolute valuations, especially as awareness grows about how option trading activity has impacted the price of both individual stocks and overall market indexes. Specifically, relative-value arguments that favor stocks will point to the data that beat expectations. The “deltas” are what matters. However, those worried about absolute valuations will argue that the declining rate of labor market improvement is troublesome not just because of the magnitude of the damage already done to the U.S. economy but also because of signs of looming corporate layoffs and the cumulative effect of declining benefits for the unemployed.
Both policy and market uncertainties are offset to some extent by the clarity exhibited by the Federal Reserve. Given the deepening of its one-sided risk mitigation paradigm — as illustrated most recently in the revisions to its monetary policy framework — the central bank is in no mood to relax its “pedal to the metal” liquidity approach until it sees unambiguous evidence of broad-based economic improvements that allow it to meet both its employment and inflation objectives. This may buy even more time for a stalemated Congress and conflicted markets but at the cost of an even bigger “only-game-in-town” burden on central banks, with all the distortions and risks of collateral damage and unintended consequences that come with that.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada added 245,800 jobs in August, the fourth consecutive monthly increase though the pace of new gains slowed, bringing employment within about a million jobs of pre-pandemic levels, Statistics Canada said on Friday.
The unemployment rate in August fell to 10.2%. The headline numbers were slightly weaker than analyst expectations of 275,000 new jobs and an unemployment rate of 10.1%.
""We are seeing some, as expected, cooling down in decent job gains. Still quite robust though,"" said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. 
""We’ve got a long way to go to before we make up the deep losses that we saw in March and April,"" he added. ""But this is another big step in the right direction.""
The Canadian dollar  was trading 0.1% higher at 1.3115 to the U.S. dollar, or 76.25 U.S. cents, even as the greenback (DXY) rallied against a basket of major currencies.Employment rose at a faster pace among women than men in August, as they continued to claw back from sharper losses. Employment for core-age women is at 95.6% of pre-pandemic levels, StatsCan said, while employment among core-age men is at 96.6% of its February level. 
The jobless rate, meanwhile, remained far higher for non-white Canadians, with Arabs at 17.9% and Blacks at 17.6%.
Analysts noted that there would challenges ahead for employment to fully return to pre-pandemic levels, particularly if there is a second wave of COVID-19 in the fall or winter.
""With provincial reopening plans having largely gone as far as they will go before a vaccine is available, we will be entering a new phase of the recovery where the path higher for employment is slower and potentially uneven,"" said Andrew Grantham, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.
Full-time employment rose by 205,800 compared with 40,000 new part-time positions. Employment in the goods-producing sector grew by 27,600 jobs, while the services sector grew by 218,100 positions.

If those who wanted to work but did not look for a job were included as unemployed in August, the adjusted unemployment rate would have been 13.0%, StatsCan said.

Investing.com -- The U.S. economy added 1,371 million nonfarm jobs in August, roughly in line with expectations, in further evidence of a gradual recovery from the disastrous second quarter. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that private payrolls rose 1.027 million, more than twice the estimate of ADP that was published on Wednesday. However, that was still short of expectations for a rise of 1.20 million. 
The overall employment numbers were boosted by around 238,000 related to hiring for the 2020 census.
The unemployment rate fell more sharply than expected, to 8.4% of the working population from 10.2% in July. Adult participation in the labor force edged up to 61.7 from 61.4.
""A good job report, but skewed by temporary census hiring,"" said Roberto Perli, Head of Global Policy Research at Cornerstone Macro via Twitter. Perli, a former Federal Reserve staffer, said the survey ""doesn't change much"" from the Fed's point of view. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had announced a major change in strategy last week by downgrading the importance of current inflation and attaching more weight to  unemployment, a more concrete illustration of slack in the economy."

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>","German industry orders edge up, 'low hanging fruit' of recovery gone","By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Orders for German industrial goods rose by a weaker-than-expected 2.8% in July, indicating an initial snap back from the coronavirus shock is fading into a slower recovery in Europe's largest economy.
The rise compared with a Reuters forecast for a 5.0% gain on the previous month, signalling a slow return to pre-crisis levels. June figures were revised up to show an increase of 28.8% from 27.9% previously reported, the Federal Statistics Office said on Friday.
Order intake in July was still 8.2% lower than in February, before lockdown measures were imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
""In the coming months, we will probably see that the low-hanging fruit has been harvested, and now the economic race to catch up will lose momentum,"" said Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg.
""We will not see the pre-crisis levels quite as quickly as some had hoped,"" he added.
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investment and trade all collapsed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A government stimulus package includes a temporary cut in value-added tax (VAT) from July 1 until Dec. 31, worth up to 20 billion euros ($24 billion), to give an additional push to domestic demand, which remains sluggish.
""ENORMOUS TWIST""
Domestic industrial orders fell by 10.2% on the month in July but orders from abroad were up 14.4%, the Statistics Office said. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the figures showed ""an enormous twist between domestic and foreign demand"".
The weak domestic demand chimed with figures published on Wednesday showing German retail sales fell unexpectedly in July, dashing hopes that household spending can drive a strong recovery in the third quarter.
Earlier this week, the chief executive of Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) said global demand for Mercedes-Benz cars had stabilised from a sharp drop in sales triggered by the coronavirus crisis.
""In China we saw a V-shaped recovery. That's not the case in Europe and North America but we have rebounded from the freefall,"" Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius said.
Germany's response to the pandemic has been effective by European standards, keeping infection and death rates relatively low despite imposing restrictions that were both milder and shorter than in many other countries.
The government on Tuesday revised upwards its 2020 forecast for the economy to shrink by 5.8% this year from a previous estimate of -6.3%. But that would still represent the biggest economic slump since World War Two.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",UK construction recovery slows unexpectedly in August: PMI,"LONDON (Reuters) - The momentum behind the recovery of Britain's construction industry faded unexpectedly in August, according to a survey on Friday that pointed to another sharp drop in employment.
The IHS Markit/CIPS UK Construction Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 54.6 from 58.1 in July, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that pointed to an improvement to 58.5.
The civil engineering sector slumped back into contraction in August and growth in the commercial and housebuilding sectors slowed.
""The latest PMI data signalled a setback for the UK construction sector as the speed of recovery lost momentum for the first time since the reopening phase began in May,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit.
""The main reason for the slowdown in total construction output growth was a reduced degree of catch-up on delayed projects and subsequent shortages of new work to replace completed contracts in August.""
Construction firms cut jobs for the 17th month running, although at a slower rate than in July. 
Still, most companies held out hope for better days ahead as the survey's gauge of business optimism rose to a six-month high.
""Construction firms turned their hopes towards a boost from major infrastructure work and reorienting their sales focus on new areas of growth in the coming 12 months,"" Moore said.
The all-sector PMI - a combination of this week's construction, services and manufacturing surveys - rose to a six-year high of 58.7 from 57.1.

Some economists view the current strength of the PMI with scepticism because it reflects an inevitable increase in businesses reporting growth as the economy reopens, rather than a recovery in output that could take years.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 04, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",China's August exports seen keeping solid momentum; imports flat: Reuters poll,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports likely posted a second month of solid gains in August as more of its trading partners relaxed coronavirus lockdowns and reopened their economies, while imports edged back into growth, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. 
China's export performance, boosted by record shipments of medical supplies and robust demand for electronic products, has not been as severely affected by the global slowdown as some analysts had feared, adding to hopes for a sustained economic recovery.
Exports in August are expected to have risen 7.1% from a year earlier, according to a median estimate of a Reuters poll of 23 economists, compared with a rise of 7.2% in July.
Imports likely rose 0.1% on year, the poll showed, still sluggish but improving after falling 1.4% the previous month.
A private survey on manufacturing activity showed Chinese factories reported the first increase in new export orders this year in August as overseas demand slowly revives. The pick-up in business also led to a further expansion in production, marking the sharpest gain in almost a decade.
Stronger exports could signal a faster and more balanced recovery for the Chinese economy, which is rebounding from a record first-quarter slump thanks largely to domestic stimulus measures.
July exports confounded analysts' expectations by rising the most this year, while some raw material imports hit record highs.
""Exports are back in play to be the key driver for Asia's biggest economy,"" Prakash Sakpal, an economist at ING, said in a note this week. 
However, external demand could suffer if virus control measures have to be re-imposed by trade partners later this year on a resurgence of the epidemic. 
China also is looking to reduce its reliance on overseas markets for its development as U.S. hostility and the pandemic increase external risks that could hamper longer-term progress.
Already heightened U.S.-China tensions are expected to escalate ahead of the U.S. presidential election. China remains well behind on its pledge to boost purchases of U.S. goods under an agreement that was launched in February.
Top U.S. and Chinese trade officials reaffirmed their commitment to a Phase 1 trade deal in a phone call last week. ""Both sides see progress and are committed to taking the steps necessary to ensure the success of the agreement,"" the U.S. Trade Representative's office said.

The U.S. Trade Representative's Office said Tuesday it had extended tariff exclusions for a wide range of Chinese goods such as smartwatches and some medical masks but only through the end of 2020, a move that may create some leverage for Washington in trade negotiations but increases uncertainty for businesses.

Around 107,000 jobs ads were posted in the week beginning Aug. 24, taking the total of active postings to 1.12 million. In the first week of August, 126,000 new ads were posted.
""The trend of improvement in hiring we are seeing may be slow, but it is sure,"" Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said.
""But we can't assume an upturn in hiring means we are out of the woods, given the likely scale of job losses this autumn as firms adapt to the new reality.""
Unemployment in Britain is expected to rise as the government winds down its coronavirus job retention scheme which is due to expire on Oct. 31. 
REC said a rise of more than 8% in adverts for air conditioning engineers and legal associate professionals suggested businesses were returning to their offices.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to get back to their workplaces to help the economy recover from its record 20% contraction in the April-June period.
Separately on Friday, a retailers group reported a modest improvement in the number of shoppers going to high streets and retail parks during August.
Footfall was down by nearly 35% compared with August 2019, a seven percentage-point improvement from July, the British Retail Consortium said.
However, there was a marked upturn in the final week of the month, Andy Sumpter, retail consultant for Europe with ShopperTrak, a research firm, said.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Thursday its non-manufacturing activity index fell to a reading of 56.9 last month from 58.1 in July. A reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index slipping to 57 in August. 
The services sector has been hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Though new infections have declined, hot spots remain, causing some businesses to be closed again and reopening plans to be scaled back. At the same time, a $600 weekly unemployment supplement funded by the government expired on July 31.
The ISM survey's measure of new orders for the services industry dropped to a reading of 56.8 last month after surging to a record 67.7 in July. But backlog orders increased and exports orders rebounded.
The survey's index of services industry employment increased to a reading of 47.9 last month from 42.1 in July. Still, the continued contraction in the index buttresses economists' expectations that employment growth slowed further in August.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 1.4 million jobs last month after rising 1.763 million in July. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
The Labor Department is scheduled to release its closely watched employment report for August on Friday.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 01:11PM ET</span>",U.S. weekly jobless claims below one million; but labor market recovery ebbing,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell below 1 million last week for the second time since the COVID-19 pandemic started in the United States, but that does not signal a strong recovery in the labor market.
The drop in initial claims to a five-month low reported by the Labor Department on Thursday largely reflected a change in the methodology it used to address seasonal fluctuations in the data, which economists complained had become less reliable because of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus crisis.
There are growing signs the labor market recovery from the depths of the pandemic in mid-March through April is faltering, with financial support from the government virtually depleted.
""There are new seasonal adjustment factors this week which brings down the joblessness slightly,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The labor market looks just as bad as it was and it will be a miracle if economic growth can continue at such a fast clip during this recovery if it has to drag along millions and millions of workers without paychecks.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 130,000 to a seasonally adjusted 881,000 for the week ended Aug. 29. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 950,000 applications in the latest week. A staggering 29.2 million people were on unemployment benefits in mid-August.
The Labor Department has switched to using additive factors to more accurately track seasonal fluctuations in the series. The government dropped the multiplicative seasonal adjustment factors it had been using because they could cause systematic over-or under-adjustment of the data in the presence of a large shift in the claims series.
Unadjusted claims rose 7,591 to 833,352 last week. The increase in the raw numbers, which many economists prefer to focus on, added to a raft of data suggesting the labor market recovery was ebbing. 
A report on Wednesday from the Federal Reserve based on information collected from the U.S. central bank's contacts on or before Aug. 24 showed an increase in employment. The Fed, however, noted that ""some districts also reported slowing job growth and increased hiring volatility, particularly in service industries, with rising instances of furloughed workers being laid off permanently as demand remained soft.""
Private employers hired fewer workers than expected in August. In addition, data from Kronos, a workforce management software company, and Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed employment growth stagnated last month.
Another report on Thursday showed job cuts elevated in August amid layoffs by airlines. United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it was preparing to furlough 16,370 workers on Oct. 1.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading sharply lower. The dollar (DXY) was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
SEVERE DISTRESS
The weak labor market reports raise the risk of a sharper slowdown in job growth in August than is currently anticipated by financial markets. The government is scheduled to publish August's employment report on Friday. 
According to a Reuters survey of economists nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 1.4 million jobs last month after increasing by 1.763 million in July. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 1.238 million to 13.254 million in the week ending Aug. 22. Part of the decrease in so-called continuing claims was likely because of people exhausting eligibility for benefits.
The number of people receiving unemployment benefits under all programs jumped 2.2 million to 29.2 million in the week ended Aug. 15.
""While Wall Street hits record highs, much of Main Street remains in severe distress,"" said Ron Temple, head of U.S. Equity at Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Asset Management in New York. ""The pandemic and the federal failure to sustain necessary assistance to households as well as state and local governments are weakening long-term economic growth and social stability.""
Fiscal stimulus boosted economic activity after it nearly ground to a halt following the shuttering of nonessential businesses in mid-March to control the spread of COVID-19. That set up the economy, which plunged into recession in February, for a sharp rebound in the third quarter. 
A $600 weekly unemployment supplement expired in July and funding programs for businesses have also lapsed, leaving the outlook for growth uncertain. Also clouding the growth prospects, the trade deficit jumped 18.9% to a 12-year high of $63.6 billion in July, driven by a record surge in imports. 
While the rise in imports could be blunted by an increase in inventories, export growth was moderate in July. That could threaten a recent acceleration in manufacturing activity.

A fourth report on Thursday showed growth in the services industry slowed in August. The services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the U.S. economy, has been hardest hit by the pandemic.

The Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, increased at an 10.1% annualized rate last quarter. That was revised up from the 7.3% pace estimated in August and was the largest rise since the first quarter of 1971.
Productivity fell at a 0.3% rate in the January-March period. Hours worked plunged at a 42.9% rate instead of the 43.0% pace estimated last month. That was the largest drop since the series started in the first-quarter of 1947.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity would be revised up to a 7.5% rate in the second quarter.
Compared to the second quarter of 2019, productivity rose at a 2.8% rate. Growth in unit labor costs - the price of labor per single unit of output - rose at a downwardly revised 9.0% rate in the April-June quarter. Unit labor costs were previously reported to have jumped at a 12.2% rate.
Unit labor costs increased at a 9.6% rate in the first quarter. They rose at a 4.9% rate in from a year ago.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Up, down and sideways: a voter's guide to U.S. economic data","By Ann Saphir
(Reuters) - In the countdown to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, the state of the economy is a key concern for many voters.
Americans face a barrage of data, from this Friday's monthly jobs report to what in all likelihood will be a blockbuster economic activity scorecard a mere five days before Election Day.
No one is debating that the United States has been struck by a recession of historic magnitude because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Rather, President Donald Trump says he is best placed to lever signs of a nascent recovery into a return to economic health. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, argues a lack of leadership by Trump - on containing the virus in particular - has made the slump worse than it needed to be.
With two months to go before the election, and less time than that for those planning to mail in their ballots, here is a voter's guide to some of the biggest economic data to watch for.
JOBS
The most highly anticipated read on the state of the labor market comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly jobs report https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm. Just two more are scheduled before Nov. 3.
Next due: Sept. 4, Oct. 2. 
What to look for: U.S. businesses probably created 1.4 million jobs last month, economists polled by Reuters say. Massive, yes, but in fact it would be the smallest monthly increase since the economic rebound began in May. And the economy would still be short about 11 million jobs compared with February. 
""If we continue to see deceleration into the September report released on Oct. 2, the message that we are probably in for a long slow recovery might start to sink in,"" said JP Morgan economist Jesse Edgerton.
What to skip: Average weekly wages, included in the jobs report, have risen dramatically. Usually a sign of a strong labor market, this time it simply reflects bigger job losses among low-wage than high-wage workers, skewing the average upward. As low-wage jobs return, expect wage growth to drop. 
Bonus data: A tally https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf released each Thursday shows the number of people receiving unemployment insurance, currently more than 29 million, with fewer than 1 million filing new claims on a seasonally-adjusted basis in the latest week for just the second time since March. Those numbers remain many times higher than pre-crisis norms. 
GRAPHIC: Jobs fell off a cliff Jobs fell off a cliff - https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/ECONOMY-DATA/xlbvglzxepq/chart.png 
SPENDING
Retail sales are back to where they were before the crisis, buoyed by the extra $600 in weekly unemployment insurance benefits paid from March to July. With that payment now down to $300, economists expect that spending fell in August.
Next due: Sept. 16, Oct. 16. 
What to look for: Continued gains in retail sales, as reported by the Commerce Department, would suggest unexpected underlying strength among consumers, whose purchases account for about two-thirds of economic activity. 
Bonus data: The Conference Board releases monthly reads on consumer sentiment, which dropped to a six-year low in August, a signal that spending could be set to weaken. The next reads are released on Sept. 29 and Oct. 27.

INFLATION
With so many millions of Americans out of work, there is little chance of a sustained surge in prices anytime soon. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is concerned inflation is too sluggish and is keeping borrowing costs low to help nudge it upward. 
Next due: Sept. 11, Oct. 13.
What to look for: The Consumer Price Index, a widely followed measure of inflation, tracks prices for a broad basket of goods and services. ""We are seeing these increases in inflation for goods that matter to the average household"" like groceries and rent, said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. If people feel they have less purchasing power, he said, that tends to hurt the incumbent party.

MANUFACTURING
Factory activity, accounting for just 11% of U.S. output but having a big impact on sentiment about the economy, has fared better than many sectors during the pandemic, in part because manufacturing sites have been able to adapt to social distancing guidelines and other measures to stop the spread of the virus. 
Next due: Oct 1., Nov. 2.
What to watch for: A reading above 50 for the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index means that factory output is increasing; a reading below 50 means that output is shrinking. The latest report showed output at a 21-month high in August.
Bonus data: Within the report is an index for new orders, which can signal the trajectory of future demand for goods.

HOUSING
Even as many people struggle to pay rent, July data from the National Association of Realtors showed the median price of an existing home shot above $300,000 for the first time. 
Next due: Sept. 22, Oct. 22. 
What to look for: Further increases to home prices could deliver a boost to the financial stability and spending power of homeowners.

GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) 
While the U.S. economy shrank at an annual pace of 31.7% in the second quarter - its worst showing since the end of World War Two - it is expected to rebound in the third quarter. 
Next due: Oct. 29. 
What to watch for: It's hard not to see this coming in as a whopper of a number. Republicans and Democrats undoubtedly will spin the data, with Trump likely pointing out, correctly, that it is the biggest quarterly gain ever for the world's biggest economy, and Biden countering, also correctly, that U.S. economic output is still way down from last year. 
CORONAVIRUS CASES
Arguably the single most important piece of data driving the economic outlook. The number of new daily coronavirus cases has moderated in the United States, but a resurgence in the fall could trigger fresh restrictions on economic activity.

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits fell to 881,000 last week, boosting hopes that the recovery in the labor market is gaining momentum despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Economists had forecast a decline to 950,000. The prior week's figure was revised slightly higher to 1.011 million from an initially reported 1.006 million.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased to 13.254 million, the largest weekly drop since May The previous week's figure was also revised downwards to 14.492 million.
The number of people making a continuing claim for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance totalled 13,570,327 in the week to Aug. 15. That was up nearly 2.6 million from a week earlier. The overall number of people receiving all unemployment-related benefits thus rose by 2.20 million to 29.22 million as of the middle of the month.
The BLS said that, as of this month, it had changed the way it adjusts its data to account for seasonal fluctuations in the labor market. It said it would change to an 'additive' system of adjustments and away from a 'multiplicative' one, as the new system should provide a more accurate picture of trends in real time and reduce the need for revisions.
Earlier Thursday, the latest Challenger jobs report showed that job cuts in August totaled 115,762, 56% lower than the 262,649 job cuts announced in July. However, the report noted that an increasing number of companies that initially had temporary job cuts or furloughs are now making them permanent.
U.S. private sector hiring slowed more than expected for a second straight month in August data showed on Wednesday, as government benefits to support workers and employers expired.
The reports come ahead of Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for August, which is expected to show that the U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs last month, down slightly from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to tick down to 9.8% from 10.2%.
But some analysts are speculating that the jobs report could be weaker than expected after recent poor consumer confidence data pointed to anxiety over rising Covid cases and worries about job prospects."

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's rebound from its deepest economic downturn on record faltered in August, surveys showed on Thursday, with some countries in the bloc suffering more than others from restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
Overall growth in the dominant service industry - which has been harder hit than manufacturing from lockdown measures - almost ground to a halt, suggesting the long road to recovery will be bumpy.
Last quarter the bloc's economy contracted 12.1% as lockdowns led to businesses being shuttered and citizens staying home, official data showed.
A Reuters poll last month predicted a bounceback this quarter with growth of 8.1% but said a full recovery would take two years or more. [ECILT/EU]
But as infection numbers have risen some restrictions have been re-imposed, and IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, suggested the economy was still floundering.
It sank to 51.9 last month from July's 54.9 - close to the 50 mark separating growth from contraction, albeit slightly better than an initial flash reading of 51.6. The services PMI fell to 50.5 from 54.7, better than its flash reading of 50.1.
""The recovery is already cooling down a little bit and it is very uneven among countries. Some countries like Germany have performed relatively well and other countries like Spain and to a lesser extent France are sending more worrying signs,"" said Daniela Ordonez at Oxford Economics. 
While Germany's services PMI fell, it nevertheless remained relatively healthy. French business activity growth also eased, with new orders stagnating as the euro zone's second-biggest economy battled the disruption to trade caused by the pandemic.
On Thursday, the French government detailed its 100 billion euro stimulus plan to erase the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis over two years, lining up billions of euros in public investments, subsidies and tax cuts.
Meanwhile the services PMIs for Italy and Spain, both of which rely heavily on tourism, dropped back below the breakeven mark as travel restrictions put in place by many European countries have hit the summer season.
Greece's economy, also largely reliant on tourism, contracted 14% last quarter, official data showed on Thursday.
In Britain, outside the currency union, the composite PMI was at a six-year high but job losses accelerated in a bleak sign ahead of the closure of the UK government's coronavirus furlough scheme at the end of next month. [GB/PMIS]
WEAK DEMAND
Demand stuttered across the currency union, despite firms cutting prices, and headcount was reduced for a sixth month.
Inflation turned negative last month for the first time since May 2016, official data showed on Tuesday, and the composite output price index remained below the 50 line at 48.5. That was below a flash reading of 49.0 but above July's 48.1.
The European Central Bank would like inflation just below 2% and has already bought record amounts of debt to keep borrowing costs down and support the economy.
ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane recently warned complacency risked entrenching low inflation and reducing price growth expectations, making it even more difficult for the ECB to deliver on its target. Some economists took his words as a hint the bank is preparing to expand stimulus even further.
""It depends on how inflation goes but it is reassuring the ECB is ready to act ... and the pressure is increasing on the ECB to act,"" Ordonez said.

That extra support may be needed as the new business index for the service sector fell below 50 to 49.8 from July's 51.4.

Fifty-seven percent of working adults traveled to work between Aug. 26 and Aug. 30, up from 55% two weeks earlier and 33% in May, the country's statistics office said on Thursday.
Those working exclusively from home slipped to 20% from 22%, the Office for National Statistics said. That figure stood at

Johnson has urged more people to get back to their workplaces as schools across Britain reopen after the summer holidays.

Counts of cars, pedestrians and cyclists in London and the north east of England returned to around pre-lockdown levels.
However, there was a reminder that Britain is facing higher unemployment as the government winds down its job retention scheme - online job adverts remained around 55% of their 2019 average for a fourth consecutive week, the ONS said.
Separately, a survey published by the Bank of England showed companies expect the hit to sales and employment from the pandemic to last well into next year.""

The European Union's statistics office Eurostat said retail sales in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 1.3% month-on-month for a 0.4% year-on-year rise. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 1.5% monthly gain and a 3.5% annual increase.
Eurostat said sales of food, drinks and cigarettes were flat month-on-month and 1.5% up year-on-year, but sales of non-food products fell 2.9% on the month and were only 0.5% higher on the year. Sales of textiles, clothes and shoes plummeted 10.6% on the month and 25.8% year-on-year.

The IHS Markit/CIPS Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), a monthly gauge of activity in services and manufacturing companies, rose to a six-year high of 59.1 from 57.0 in July.
Still, that was revised down from a preliminary ""flash"" reading of 60.3, hinting at a weaker end to activity last month.
Some economists view the current strength of the PMI with scepticism because it reflects an inevitable increase in businesses reporting growth as the economy reopens, rather than a recovery in output that could take years.
The survey's index of employment declined for the first time in three months - chiming with widespread reports of layoffs from major employers grappling with the hit from the pandemic.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said companies' ability to cope with the withdrawal of economic support measures like the furlough programme was now the ""burning question"".
The government's job retention scheme has supported almost 10 million jobs in total since its launch in April.
""Worryingly, many companies are already preparing for tougher times ahead, notably via further fierce job cutting,"" Williamson said.
""Policymakers face a huge challenge in sustaining this recovery and avoiding a 'bounce and fade' scenario.""

Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) of services companies, which account for around half of the country's economic output, fell to 47.7 from 51.9 in July. The 50 line separates growth from contraction, and the survey hit a record low of 7.1 in April.
""August's services data will dash the hopes of those looking for a V-shaped recovery in Spain's services economy as activity fell on the back of a lack of incoming new business,"" said Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit.
A sister survey of Spanish manufacturing activity on Monday also showed a decline to 49.9 in August from 53.5 in July.
After the three-month lockdown ended in late June, Spain's economy gradually revived in July. But new outbreaks of the coronavirus and travel restrictions imposed by various European countries have ravaged the summer tourism season.
Since the end of the lockdown in June, Spain has suffered a sharp resurgence in cases as measures were relaxed and mass testing began. The daily number of infections is now close to the March peak.

The Spanish economy contracted 18.5% in the second quarter, the widest margin on record and one of the deepest downturns in the region.

The Caixin/Markit services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped to 54.0 from July's 54.1, dipping for the second month after June's decade high, but staying above the 50-mark that separates monthly growth from contraction.
The services sector, which accounts for about 60% of the economy and half of urban jobs, had been slower to return to growth initially than large manufacturers, but the recovery has gathered pace in recent months as COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings lifted.
Firms started to hire more in August after six months of layoffs, indicating some recovery in a labour market that has been hit hard by sharp falls in demand and epidemic restrictions earlier in the year. 
Domestic demand drove new orders, with the Caixin survey showing new export businesses received by Chinese services firms contracting again in August, albeit at a slower pace.
However, the growth in new orders was the weakest in four months and dropped below the long-term average.
""The ongoing resumption of work and normalisation of market demand continued to promote the post-epidemic economic recovery,"" said Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group.
Service firms remained optimistic about business prospects as the economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 lockdowns, although a sub-index for confidence in the year dipped from July's multi-year high. 
China returned to growth in the second quarter after a deep slump at the start of the year, but unexpected weakness in domestic consumption underscored the need for more policy support to bolster the recovery. 

Many analysts expect the country to be the only major economy to mark positive annual growth in 2020.

Investing.com – China’s Caixin services PMI for August came in at 54, just slightly down from July’s reading of 54.1. That said, the index still pointed to a recovery in the sector that has now extended into a fourth consecutive month.
The PMI for August managed to stay above the 50-mark separating growth from contraction. In May, the services PMI was 55, then rose to a new high of 58.4 in June, indicating a substantial increase in service sector activity.
“The Caixin China General Services Business Activity Index [services PMI] came in at 54 in August, almost the same as the previous month‘s 54.1. The ongoing resumption of work and normalization of market demand continued to promote the post-epidemic economic recovery,” said Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.
The reading indicates developments in the private sector economy by tracking variables such as sales, employment, inventories and prices.
Growth of China’s services sector has remained elevated for four months now. The sector takes up 60% of China’s economy and half of the jobs in the cities. The positive data from the sector indicates the country’s economy is quickening its pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The country has been reaping the benefits from its efforts to contain the pandemic, with major cities such as Beijing allowing public gatherings again.
China also unveiled on Monday the official non-manufacturing PMI that covers larger firms in services and construction. The reading came in at 55.2 for August, up from 54.2 in July.

The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit Saudi Arabia Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) declined to 48.8 from 50.0 in July, slipping back below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.
""After stabilising in July, the economy fell back into a downturn as firms registered a solid drop in new business, in part linked to the rise in VAT charges and ongoing social distancing measures,"" the IHS report said.
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, tripled VAT in July to 15% to boost state coffers badly hit by low oil prices, in a move several economists said will likely slow the economic recovery from the coronavirus downturn.
""Newly-imposed VAT changes stalled consumer spending across the Saudi Arabia economy in August, latest PMI data suggested,"" said David Owen, economist at IHS Markit.
""New business was down solidly from July, as several firms commented that the sharp uptick in prices kept some customers away from markets,"" he said.
Business activity and employment declined for the sixth consecutive month, although the declines were modest and the drop in employment was the slowest since May.
Due to the VAT hike, businesses reported the sharpest increase in input costs since September 2012, as suppliers increased prices of raw materials.
There had been signs of resilient economic activity in July, including annual increases in points of sales transactions and lending to the private sector, data from the central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, showed on Aug. 30.

To stem the impact of the pandemic on small and medium-sized enterprises, the central bank this week extended deferrals on bank payments for three more months.

The final Jibun Bank Japan Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) inched down to a seasonally adjusted 45.0 in August from 45.4 in the previous month, pressured by weakening new business and business expectations.
The survey results will be discouraging news for policymakers who are counting on a pickup in domestic spending to help pull the world's third-largest economy out of a sharp recession.
""The COVID-19 pandemic continued to hang over the Japanese service sector in August, halting previous momentum towards recovery amid fragile customer demand,"" said Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit.
The headline index, which worsened for the first time since April, matched a preliminary reading, with firms reporting a negative impact from a lack of customers and restrictions on activity.
The survey also showed employment conditions in the services sector remained sluggish in August, with firms reporting the same pace of job cuts as in the previous month mainly due to reduced workloads.
Japan's July jobless rate rose to 2.9% and the jobs-to-applicants ratio slipped for a seventh straight month to 1.08, which marked the lowest level since April 2014, the government said this week.
The composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services, was largely unchanged in August from the previous month, ticking up to 45.2 from July's final 44.9.
""Services saw output fall more quickly than manufacturing for the first time since May, suggesting that the sector is more impacted by the lingering effects of the pandemic on demand,"" Harker said.

Researcher Springboard said the vacancy rate rose to 10.8% in July, from 9.8% in January 2020, reaching its highest level since January 2014 as Britain's store-based retail sector, outside of food, was hit by a lockdown to counter the pandemic.
Already weak players such as Laura Ashley, Debenhams, Oasis Warehouse, Cath Kidston and Monsoon/Accessorize have all gone into administration, with the loss of thousands of jobs, while other major retailers, including Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), Boots (O:WBA) and John Lewis [JLPLC.UL], are also closing stores.
Britain's store groups were already struggling with high rents and business taxes, tight margins and online competition before the pandemic took a grip on the country's economy.
Springboard said vacancies rose in six out of ten areas, but by far the greatest increase was in Greater London, where the vacancy rate rose by nearly two-thirds.
""This result brings into sharp focus the difficulties faced by large cities in attracting customers back and the impact of this on our bricks and mortar retail landscape,"" Springboard director Diane Wehrle said in a statement.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",U.S. private payrolls undershoot expectations; labor market recovery losing speed,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private employers hired fewer workers than expected for a second straight month in August, suggesting that the labor market recovery was slowing as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and government money to support workers and employers dries up.
The moderation in job growth was also flagged by another report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday showing furloughed workers increasingly being laid off permanently in some parts of the country. 
The bulk of hiring last month was by large businesses, with small enterprises posting a modest increase. A $600 weekly unemployment supplement expired on July 31, while a program that gave businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee pay has also lapsed.
""The recovery in jobs lost in this pandemic recession was always a weak one,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""But for a second month in a row it is looking like the jobs are not going to come back unless there is more stimulus from Washington to bolster economic demand and keep business activity and consumer spending growing.""
Private payrolls increased by 428,000 jobs last month, the ADP National Employment Report showed. Data for July was revised higher to show hiring up by 212,000 jobs instead of the initially reported 167,000. The revision still left the July tally out of alignment with the 1.462 million rise in private employment reported by the government last month. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls would increase by 950,000 in August. 
The ADP report, jointly developed with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, has fallen short of the government payrolls count since May because of methodology differences. The ADP report is based on active and paid employees on company payrolls. 
The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) counts workers as employed if they received a paycheck during the week that includes the 12th of the month.
When businesses were shuttered in mid-March, millions of workers were either laid off or furloughed. Some economists believe that the return of furloughed workers when most businesses reopened in May boosted the employment numbers reported by the government.
Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told reporters he expected the gap between the ADP and BLS private payrolls to narrow in August. The government is scheduled to publish August's employment report on Friday.
According to a Reuters survey of economists, private payrolls probably increased by 1.250 million jobs in August after rising 1.462 million in July. Such a gain would result in nonfarm payrolls advancing by 1.4 million jobs last month after increasing 1.763 million. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
Separately on Wednesday, the Fed's ""Beige Book"" report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide showed employment rising overall among districts, with gains mostly in manufacturing. 
But the U.S. central bank said ""some districts also reported slowing job growth and increased hiring volatility, particularly in service industries, with rising instances of furloughed workers being laid off permanently as demand remained soft."" 
The Fed also noted that ""firms continued to experience difficulty finding necessary labor, a matter compounded by day care availability, as well as uncertainty over the coming school year and jobless benefits.""
""Risks remain tilted to the downside for recovery in the labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar gained against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
UNCERTAIN OUTLOOK
The moderation in job growth suggested by the ADP report is in line with other labor market indicators. Weekly new applications for unemployment benefits are hovering around 1 million. Data from Kronos, a workforce management software company, showed seasonally adjusted shift growth continued to stagnate in August, while figures from Homebase, a payroll scheduling and tracking company, showed little change in employment last month from July.
""In order for the economy to begin to add the number of jobs that continue to be predicted each month, we must first see a significant and sustained increase in overall shift volume growth,"" said Dave Gilbertson, vice president, strategy and operations at Kronos.
United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it was preparing to furlough 16,370 workers on Oct. 1. Airlines received $25 billion in government stimulus funds in March to pay wages and protect jobs through September.
Large businesses accounted for 298,000 new jobs last month, while small business payrolls increased 52,000. Medium-sized companies added 79,000 jobs.
Most of the increase in employment in August was in industries directly impacted by the pandemic, including restaurants, leisure and hospitality. There were also gains in temporary help, reflecting the uncertain economic environment.

Manufacturers hired 9,000 workers.

The stimulus package includes a temporary cut in value-added tax (VAT) from July 1 until Dec. 31, worth up to 20 billion euros, to give domestic demand an additional push.
But the retail sales figures released by the Federal Statistics Office cast some doubt on whether the measure is working. Some companies are not passing on the tax cut to consumers and shoppers generally seem to be holding back.
Retail sales were down by 0.9% on the month in real terms in July after a revised drop of 1.9% in June and a 13.2% jump in May, when authorities eased lockdown measures.
This missed a Reuters forecast for a 0.5% increase, though retail sales are a volatile indicator often subject to revision.
""The disappointment among German retailers is likely to have been great: The VAT cut on July 1 did not lead to the hoped-for increase in sales, at least in the first month,"" DZ bank economist Michael Holstein said.
But Holstein warned that it was too early to write off the tax cut as ineffective -- it could still help in the coming months.
V-SHAPED RECOVERY
The retail picture was a bit brighter over the past 12 months. On the year, retail sales rose by 4.2% in real terms after an upwardly revised increase of 6.7% the previous month, the data showed.
Compared with February, the month before the outbreak of the pandemic, retail sales were 0.9% higher in real terms in July, the office said, suggesting they managed to recover relatively quickly.
In the first seven months of the year, retailers increased their sales by 2.6% in real terms despite the crisis.
The data revealed huge gaps within the sector. Sales in shops selling textiles, clothes, shoes and leather goods collapsed by more than a quarter in the January-July period. Online retailers increased their sales by a fifth.
The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as household spending, company investment and trade all collapsed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government on Tuesday revised upwards its 2020 forecast for the economy to shrink by 5.8% this year from a previous estimate of -6.3%. But this would still represent the biggest economic slump since World War Two.

The number of jobless people rose by 0.79% in August, pushing up the national total to 3.80 million and ending a positive trend that began in May when Spain began emerging from one of Europe's strictest coronavirus lockdowns.
The heavily tourism-dependent Balearic Islands were the hardest hit region, registering a 3% rise in unemployment.
The pace of job creation in Spain stagnated in August, with only 6,822 more people with a formal working contract and contributing to social security in that month, compared to an increase of 161,000 in July, the social security minister said on Wednesday. 
Overall, Spain had about 740,000 more jobless people in August than in the same month a year ago. The lockdown prompted by the coronavirus erased some 900,000 jobs in March alone. 
After the three-month lockdown ended in late June, Spain's economy gradually revived in July but new outbreaks of the coronavirus and travel restrictions imposed by various European countries have ravaged the crucial tourism season.
Spending on unemployment benefits fell to 3.2 billion euros in July, according to the last data available. 
""The travel restrictions by European countries have had an impact on unemployment data,"" Secretary of State for Employment Joaquín Pérez Rey told a news conference, with almost all the new jobless focused on the service sector.
The number of workers registered in Spain's ERTE furlough scheme fell by 27% to 812,438 in August.

Since the end of the lockdown in June, Spain has suffered a sharp resurgence in cases as measures were relaxed and mass testing began and the daily number of infections is now close to the March peak. Spain's total tally of COVID-19 cases now stands at 470,973, the highest number in Europe, with 29,152 deaths.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Like many Lebanese expatriates, Nadim Srour wired savings back as a nest egg for his return. Now those deposits have crumbled in an economic crisis and a Beirut blast has destroyed his home.
""Our lives turned 180 degrees,"" said the 43-year-old who returned from the Gulf with his wife and two sons in September 2019 - a month before Lebanon's banking system imploded and a year before the port explosion shattered a swathe of Beirut.
""Now we are ruined.""
His story is far from unique in a nation that piled up a mountain of public debt to rebuild after its 1975-1990 civil war, attracting savers with high interest rates, but squandered most of the cash amid mismanagement and corruption.
The system that some economists likened to a state Ponzi scheme collapsed last year. Banks drew down the shutters on savers like Srour, who now face strict limits on the amount they can withdraw, while the real value of those deposits has been slashed as Lebanon's pound has crashed.
""We have money and they will not give it to us. We are being driven like sheep,"" said Srour, who left the United Arab Emirates after a construction downturn there and has now joined Lebanon's growing ranks of jobless.
A minister in January put the unemployment rate at above 35%. Economic hardship has only deepened since then.
Compounding the crisis, a huge quantity of highly explosive material stacked up in unsafe conditions in a warehouse in Beirut port blew up on Aug. 4, killing more than 190 people and destroying houses - including the apartment of Srour's parents where he had returned to live until he could buy his own place.
A charity helped Srour find a Beirut flat for his family, while his elderly parents and brother, who is unable to work due to childhood injuries sustained in the civil war, have moved to the mountains, a place of refuge in Lebanon's troubled times.
FROZEN SAVINGS
Srour's savings have been frozen for two years under a deal allowing him to convert his Lebanese pounds to dollars. But he can only withdraw at an exchange rate of 3,900 to the dollar, well below the pound's street value which has touched 8,000. The pound was previously pegged to the U.S. currency at 1,500.
Banks also limit how much savers can withdraw. ""Now we stand in line outside the bank and hope we get a turn,"" Srour said.
The curbs have not been formalised as capital controls and the central bank has said deposits would not be subject to a ""haircut"", or a reduction in the total depositors will receive.
But such comments offer little reassurance to Srour or his father, Maurice, who rebuilt his savings once before after a 1980s currency crisis. Although he has money in the bank, his family can only take out the equivalent of $1,000 a month.
""Even if I want to use it to fix my house, the bank won't give it to me,"" Maurice Srour said.
The central bank has instructed Lebanese banks to offer interest-free, dollar loans to help those making repairs. But borrowing at any rate does little for those without salaries.
""I don't want a loan. I want my money,"" said Samir Sfeir, a 75-year-old retiree with cuts on his arms from the port blast.
He can only withdraw $700 a month from the bank and has turned to the generosity of friends to help rebuild his home.
Joe Nader, a 48-year-old bank employee and property owner, has been repairing a furnished apartment building for his 13 tenants. But he struggles to find the dollars suppliers demand.
He said his family ""are selling our possessions for cash: gold, prayer beads, paintings"" to raise the dollars he needs.

For some, like Srour, this is a fresh reminder of why they went abroad to work in the past. And given the chance, he'd leave Lebanon again: ""If we could, we would do so tonight.""

1615,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 10:09PM ET</span>","Australian GDP Falls by Most on Record, Confirming Recession","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s economy contracted by the most on record last quarter, with the recovery from the nation’s first recession in almost 30 years buffeted by Victoria state’s renewed Covid outbreak and lockdown.
Gross domestic product plunged 7% from the first three months of the year, the first back-to-back quarterly declines since 1991, statistics bureau data showed in Sydney Wednesday. The slump was larger than economist forecasts of a 6% drop. From a year earlier, it tumbled 6.3% versus an estimated 5.1% fall.
The Australian dollar fell after the report, trading at 73.43 U.S. cents at 12:05 p.m. in Sydney from 73.60 cents.
Australia’s early lifting of restrictions and reopening of its economy is now being offset by an almost two-month lockdown in Melbourne, the nation’s second-largest city with about 5 million people, delaying the recovery.
The central bank and government are working in tandem to try to support the economy, with the former on Tuesday expanding a lending facility to banks to keep credit flowing and the latter extending its labor market assistance package.
Today’s report showed:
The Reserve Bank in March cut its cash rate to a record-low 0.25% and set the same target for the three-year bond yield as it aims to lower borrowing costs across the economy. The RBA predicts the renewed lockdown will lift unemployment to about 10% later this year.
The government, meantime, has injected tens of billions of dollars into the economy including its signature JobKeeper wage subsidy program designed to keep workers attached to firms as it tries to maintain employment connections until activity can resume.
Australia’s record run of avoiding two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, which included avoiding recessions during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the Dot Com Bubble and the 2008 global financial crisis, has come to an end with the largest contraction on record according to ABS data dating back to 1959. It now joins much of the world in succumbing to a pandemic-induced downturn.
On the upside, China’s stimulus to revive its economy is fueling demand for Australian commodity prices, keeping the terms of trade elevated in the second quarter. Australia saw a record current-account surplus of A$17.7 billion ($13.1 billion) in the three months through June, aided by the nation’s closed international borders which is keeping people from traveling abroad.
Yet its trade position has also fueled the nation’s currency, which soared almost 30% from a nadir in March.
The central bank on Tuesday boosted a line of cheap funding to banks to A$200 billion. In addition to supporting the economy, that should also help ease some of the upward pressure on the currency by confirming the RBA’s commitment to keeping conditions accommodative until activity recovers.

Average shop prices in August were 1.6% lower than a year before, compared with a fall of 1.3% in July and a record 2.4% tumble in May, the British Retail Consortium said.
August's fall was driven by bigger price declines of 3.4% for non-food prices, compared with a 2.9% drop in July.
""Many retailers have continued to run promotions and sales in order to entice customers to spend and make up for lost ground during lockdown,"" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said.
The availability of fresh, seasonal produce allowed food inflation to ease to 1.3% in August, down from 1.5% in July, Dickinson said.
Figures from the Confederation of British Industry published last week showed an unexpected weakening of retail sales in the first half of August, raising concerns that a bounce-back in consumer spending after the lockdown might be short-lived.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment is projected to increase by 6 million jobs this decade, with the annual growth rate sharply slower than during the economy's recovery from the Great Recession, according to a government report on Tuesday.
The projections published by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) do not include the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts, and are developed using models based on historical data. 
The coronavirus crisis delivered the biggest economic shock since the Great Depression, with 22 million jobs lost. Only 9.3 million jobs had been recovered by July.
""The 2019-29 projections were finalized in the spring of 2020 when there was still significant uncertainty about the duration and impacts of the pandemic,"" the BLS said.
Employment is projected to increase to 168.8 million over the 2019-29 decade from 162.8 million over the prior period. That reflects an annual growth rate of 0.4%, significantly slower than the 2009-19 pace of 1.3%, which was bolstered by recovery from the 2007-09 recession. 
The healthcare and social assistance industry is projected to add the most new jobs, and six of the 10 fastest-growing occupations are related to healthcare, the BLS said. 
The long-term projections are intended to capture structural changes in the economy, not cyclical fluctuations. The projected pedestrian employment growth pace reinforces economists' belief that it could take years for the labor market to recoup the jobs lost during the pandemic.
A moderate pace of economic growth is also projected. Inflation-adjusted gross domestic product is forecast rising 1.8% annually from 2019 to 2029, down from 2.3% in the prior decade.
The labor force is expected to increase by 8.0 million to 171.5 million in 2029. The labor force participation rate, the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, is forecast falling to 61.2% in 2029 from 63.1% in 2019.
""The decline in labor force participation is due to the aging of the baby-boom generation, a continuation of the declining trend in men's participation, and a slight decline in women's participation,"" the BLS said. ""By 2029, all baby boomers will be at least 65 years old."" 

Worker productivity is seen increasing 1.8% from 1.1% during the 2009-19 decade.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>",U.S. factory activity accelerates as orders jump to more than 16-1/2-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity increased more than expected in August as new orders surged to their highest level in over 16-1/2 years, but employment at factories continued to lag amid safety restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19.
The upbeat report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) strengthened expectations for a sharp rebound in economic activity this quarter, though the outlook is uncertain as money from the government dries up. Manufacturing is not out of the woods yet as the coronavirus crisis lingers. 
Factory activity is being driven by demand for goods used at home like electronics while capital investment remains weak. The ISM said manufacturers described sentiment as ""generally optimistic, though to a lesser degree compared to July."" The economy, which slipped into recession in February, suffered its deepest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter.
""The economy isn't back to normal regardless of what these upbeat surveys of purchasing manager executives are telling us,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Time will tell if companies should be more vigilant about expansion plans. Government pandemic stimulus programs are starting to sputter, and attempts to limit bankruptcies and foreclosures, and those paycheck protection schemes, are all set to fade.""
The ISM said its index of national factory activity increased to a reading of 56.0 last month from 54.2 in July. That was the highest level since November 2018 and marked three straight months of growth. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the U.S. economy. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising to 54.5 in August.
Underscoring the uneven landscape, manufacturers of transportation equipment said ""airline industry continues to be under great pressure."" Makers of machinery said ""capital equipment new orders have slowed again.""
In contrast, manufacturers of electrical equipment, appliances and components reported ""strong demand from existing and new customers."" Similar sentiments were echoed by makers of chemical, wood and fabricated metal products. 
Fifteen industries including wood, primary metals and computer and electronic products reported growth in August. Printing and related support activities, petroleum and coal, and furniture and related products contracted.
""Manufacturers tied to services hit hard by the pandemic continue to struggle,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte North Carolina. ""As the pandemic drags on... manufacturers, even those tied most tightly to goods spending, are hardly in the clear.""
For now manufacturing is chugging along, and also picked up across the world in August. Factory activity in China expanded at the fastest clip in nearly a decade last month, while manufacturing remained on a recovery path in the euro zone.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.
EMPLOYMENT TRAILING
The ISM's forward-looking new orders sub-index increased to a reading of 67.6 in August, the strongest since January 2004, from 61.5 in July. Fifteen industries reported an increase in demand. Only one industry said orders declined. A measure of customers' inventories dropped to its lowest level since June 2010, an indication that orders could rise further.
The survey's measure of order backlogs at factories increased as did orders for exports.
Though factory employment continued to improve last month, it remained in contraction territory. The ISM's manufacturing employment measure rose to a reading of 46.4 from 44.3 in July. This measure has now contracted for 13 straight months. 
According to the ISM ""companies and suppliers operated in reconfigured factories, with limited labor application due to safety restrictions."" It said ""long-term labor market growth remains uncertain.""
Factory employment was already in decline before the coronavirus crisis because of the Trump administration's trade war with China. Its struggle to rebound even as orders received by factories are rising fits in with economists' views that the labor market is losing steam after being boosted by the reopening of businesses in May. 
The government's closely followed employment report to be released on Friday is expected to show 1.4 million jobs created in August after 1.763 million were added in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. That would leave nonfarm payrolls about 11.5 million below their pre-pandemic level.
Even with manufacturing now in what some economists say is a V-shaped recovery, business investment remains lackluster. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed construction spending edged up 0.1% in July after falling 0.5% in June, confounding economists' expectations for a 1.0% rebound. While low mortgage rates boosted investment in homebuilding, outlays on nonresidential construction projects such as office infrastructure and power fell, potential headwinds to manufacturing.
Spending on public construction projects tumbled 1.3%, with big declines in education, highways and streets.

""Public construction will continue to be held down as state and local budgets are squeezed by the pandemic,"" said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending would rebound 1.0% in July. Construction spending dipped 0.1% on a year-on-year basis.
Spending on private construction projects advanced 0.6%, boosted by investment in homebuilding amid record-low mortgage rates. Spending on residential projects surged 2.1%, eclipsing a 1.0% drop in outlays on nonresidential construction projects such as manufacturing and power plants. 

Spending on public construction projects tumbled 1.3%.

The IHS Markit Canada Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 55.1 in August, its highest level since the same month two years ago, from 52.9 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector.
In April, when many businesses were closed to help contain the coronavirus pandemic, the index slumped to a record low of 33.0.
The data ""highlighted a strong upturn in the Canadian manufacturing industry, continuing the recovery from the severe second quarter downturn,"" Shreeya Patel, an economist at IHS Markit, said in a statement.
""Production and order book volumes both expanded at the fastest pace in two years, driven by the reopening of client businesses and improvements in customer demand,"" Patel said.
On Friday, a flash estimate from Statistics Canada showed that Canada's gross domestic product increased 3% in July, edging economic activity closer to pre-pandemic levels. 
The PMI's measure of new export orders showed that foreign demand for Canadian goods expanded for the first time in six months, while the employment index climbed to its highest level since January 2019.

On a more cautious note, IHS Markit said that transportation delays, reduced staff and pandemic restrictions contributed to one of the steepest deteriorations in supplier performance since the start of the survey and input price inflation accelerated to a 19-month high.

1621,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>",Europe's inflation plunge to raise red flags at ECB,"By Jan Strupczewski and Balazs Koranyi
BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation turned negative last month for the first time since May 2016, raising chances that the European Central Bank will have to inject yet more stimulus to generate price growth which has undershot its target for over seven years.
Annual inflation in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell to minus 0.2% in August from 0.4% in July, underperforming analysts' expectations for a reading of 0.2% and a far cry from the ECB's target of just under 2%.
Worryingly for policymakers, underlying inflation also tumbled, suggesting that the bloc's deepest recession in living memory is not just a temporary shock but could prove to become a bigger and longer-lasting drag on consumer prices.
Inflation excluding volatile fuel and unprocessed food prices, which is closely watched by the ECB, fell to 0.6% from 1.3% while an even narrower measure, which also excludes alcohol and tobacco, slowed to 0.4% from 1.2%. Both were far below analysts' expectations.
""There is no escaping the disinflationary effects of the crisis, at least over the coming quarters,"" Pictet Wealth Management Strategist Frederik Ducrozet said. 
""We stick with our view that the ECB will ultimately increase the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme envelope again, most likely by 500 billion euros in December.""
Energy prices tumbled 7.8% year-on-year in August after an 8.4% fall in July. Prices of non-industrial goods also declined by 0.1% after a 1.6% increase in July.
As coronavirus restrictions pushed the euro zone economy into freefall this year, the ECB acted quickly, buying record amounts of debt to keep borrowing costs down and lending banks more than 1 trillion euros at negative interest rates.
But even with this stimulus in place, ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane recently warned that complacency risked entrenching low inflation and reducing price growth expectations, making it even more difficult for the ECB to deliver on its target. 
Some economists took his words as a hint that the ECB is preparing to expand stimulus even further. But others noted that one-off, temporary factors had skewed inflation readings over the summer and that a mechanical rebound later is likely.

ECB policymakers next meet on Sept. 10 and while no major policy moves are expected, economists still expect further stimulus before the year end.

The region was hit hard by the initial coronavirus outbreak, as businesses and daily life came to a virtual halt and foreign trade sank.
Updated gross domestic product data this week showed a year-on-year contraction of 8.2%-13.6% in countries across the region, with Hungary the worst hit and Poland and the Czech Republic faring better than expected.
Sentiment indicators are giving some hope the worst is over even if a slower recovery is seen.
In Poland, manufacturing activity improved more slowly in August as demand stagnated, with IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling to 50.6 last month from 52.8 in July.
The Czech Markit PMI rose to 49.1 in August from 47.0 in July, its best reading since December 2018 but still below the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion.
In Hungary, a similar PMI survey by the Association of Logistics, Purchasing and Inventory Management rose to 52.8.
Katarzyna Rzentarzewska, an economist at Erste Group Bank, said data was pointing to a recovery shaped more like the  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) brand's ""Swoosh"" than a ""V"", assuming no broad lockdowns again. 
""Rising infections ... may affect the pace or dynamics of this recovery so we may see some uncertainty or cautiousness but at this point it is not translating into worsening market conditions,"" she said.
Central Europe, like western Europe, has seen an uptick in COVID-19 cases since the summer, leading Hungary to shut its borders to most foreign tourists in September. Governments are seeking to avoid nationwide lockdowns.
""(Manufacturing) optimism for the next 12 months persists but has faded in the face of the uncertain epidemic situation,"" Poland's Alior Bank said.
Capital Economics said the PMIs indicated industrial out growth of around 3% in Poland in the third quarter and around 5% in Hungary.
""Industrial sectors are likely to recover further over the coming months, although the pace of the rebound is likely to slow,"" Liam Peach, emerging Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany expects the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to be less severe than originally feared this year, but it now sees a weaker rebound for Europe's largest economy next year, two sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
The government revised upward its economic forecast for 2020 to a decline of 5.8% from a previously expected slump of 6.3%, said two people with knowledge of the figures.
Still, this would be the biggest plunge since the end of World War Two. During the world financial crisis, the German economy contracted by 5.7%.
For 2021, the government revised downward its growth forecast to an expansion of 4.4% from its previous estimate of 5.2%, said the two people who both spoke on condition of anonymity.
This means the German economy will not reach its pre-pandemic level before 2022.
An economy ministry spokesman declined to comment.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier will present the updated outlook later on Tuesday (0900 GMT) after the economy suffered its worst recession on record in the first half of the year.
The updated GDP forecast will form the basis of tax revenue estimates, which the finance ministry is expected to update next week, and with them the 2021 budget, which Finance Minister Olaf Scholz is expected to present later this month.

The IHS Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 55.2 in August from July's 53.3, broadly in line with an earlier flash estimate of 55.3 and the highest since February 2018.
The PMI's output component -- which IHS Markit says can give a better guide to the sector's strength than the headline figure -- rose to its highest since May 2014.
The index levels represent the pace of growth rather than the amount of output, however, and the sector has a long way to go to get back to where it was before the lockdown.
Job losses were widespread at the businesses surveyed.
""Companies report that the current bounce is mainly driven by the restarting of manufacturers' operations and reopening of clients as COVID-19 restrictions continue to be relaxed,"" said Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
""Backlogs of work fell at an increased rate, hinting at spare capacity, and the labour market remains worryingly weak, with job losses registered for the seventh straight month.""

Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit, said the recovery was not widespread as some German manufacturers were still struggling with weak demand.
""The encouraging top line numbers mask ongoing troubles in some sectors, especially machinery and equipment production, which is being hit by a lack of appetite for investment,"" he said.

IHS Markit's final Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 51.7 from July's 51.8, in line with an earlier flash reading and comfortably ahead of the 50 mark separating growth from contraction.
An index measuring change in output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Thursday that is seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 55.6 from 55.3, just below the flash reading of 55.7 but its highest level since April 2018.
""Euro zone factory output rose strongly again in August, providing further encouraging evidence that production will rebound sharply in the third quarter after the collapse seen at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit.
Despite optimism at a two-year high, factories reduced headcount and ordered fewer raw materials. The employment index sagged well below the break-even mark at 44.2, albeit closer to it than July's 42.9.
""A key theme of the latest survey is one of firms taking a cautious approach to costs and spending, notably in respect to investment and hiring, amid continued worries about the strength of future demand and uncertainty over the course of the pandemic,"" Williamson said. 
A full recovery from the euro zone's deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a Reuters poll of economists last month.

1628,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 01:22AM ET</span>",Chinese Factory Activity Bolstered Over 2020’s First New Export Orders,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com – A private survey showed that Chinese factory activity expanded at the fastest rate in nearly a decade over the year’s first new export orders, with manufacturers raising production to meet the increased demand.
Chains said on Tuesday that the Caixin manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for August increased to 53.1, higher than July’s figure of 52.8 and the forecasted 52.6 prepared by Investing.com. The reading indicated a fourth consecutive month of growth and the biggest rate of expansion since January 2011.
The Chinese economy continues to make progress in the economic recovery from COVID-19, with the export orders a potential signal of a more durable and broad recovery ahead. The orders came on the back of countries loosening COVID-19 restrictions to kickstart their own economic recoveries
However, August’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indexes (PMIs), released on Monday, struck a note of caution. Monday’s data showed that factory activity grew at a slightly slower pace in August, attributable to flooding in parts of China over the summer, but the services sector was at its strongest level since 2018.
China’s labor market saw more companies hiring to meet the increased production needs, but unemployment remains a concern
“Employment remained an important focus. An expansion of employment relies on long-term improvement in the economy. Macroeconomic policy supports are essential, especially when there are still many uncertainties in domestic and overseas economies,” Caixin Insight Group senior economist Wang Zhe said in in a commentary accompanying the data release.
He added that employment was reaching a “turning point” as factories’ backlogs of work rose at a faster pace.
Meanwhile, Chinese factories’ business optimism towards the year ahead remained strong overall but saw a slight dip in August over fears of COVID-19's long-term severity."
1629,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 01, 2020 01:00AM ET</span>",Asia’s Factories Continue Their Fragile Recovery in August,"(Bloomberg) -- Closely watched manufacturing gauges in Asia show a continued gradual improvement for the region’s manufacturing powerhouses like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, even as the picture from the rest of the region is more mixed.
Purchasing managers’ indexes for Japan and South Korea improved in August, to 47.2 and 48.5, according to IHS Markit figures, their strongest performance since February. Taiwan’s reading continued to stay above 50, the dividing line between contraction and expansion, recording 52.2 for the month for its best showing in two years.
A private gauge of China’s factory activity grew at the fastest pace in August since January 2011, helped by improving exports and continued domestic recovery. The Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose for the fourth consecutive month to 53.1 from July’s 52.8, beating the median estimate of 52.5.
“Asia’s purchasing managers’ indexes, on balance, showed the economic recovery extending into August but also revealed that some parts of the region stumbled,” said Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics.
For Taiwan, the bumper performance was driven by better new orders and improving output, according to Annabel Fiddes, associate director at IHS Markit.
“Companies frequently mentioned that the reopening of clients and resumption of operations, both at home and overseas, had helped to lift sales,” Fiddes said in a release. “Furthermore, firms recorded the first increase in export orders since January, adding to hopes that the global economic recovery is gaining momentum.”
Indexes in Southeast Asia showed some setbacks. While Indonesia advanced into expansion territory, Malaysia slipped below the 50 dividing line, and the Philippines and Vietnam retreated further into contraction.
A separate report Monday showed Chinese economic activity continued to rebound in August, with a gauge of the services industry at the strongest level since early 2018 while the expansion in manufacturing activity slowed slightly. The non-manufacturing gauge rose to 55.2 from July’s 54.2, the National Bureau of Statistics said Monday. The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index moderated to 51 from 51.1 a month earlier.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 10:50PM ET</span>",Japan's second-quarter capex falls most in decade on pandemic blow,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese firms slashed spending on plant and equipment by the most in a decade in the second quarter, the government said on Tuesday, suggesting the economy will take a protracted period to fully rebound from the coronavirus-induced slump. 
Separate private-sector data showed that factory activity in August shrank at the slowest pace in six months, reducing some pressure on policymakers to act more aggressively to prevent a deeper recession. Other official data pointed to worsening labour market conditions.
The fall in spending comes after the government called a state of emergency early in the second quarter in a bid to tackle the health crisis, which also led to sharp declines in corporate profits and sales in the quarter.
Capital spending shed 11.3% in April-June year-on-year, the biggest drop since the first quarter of 2010, as the COVID-19 crisis hit investments by the manufacturing as well as service sector, Ministry of Finance (MOF) data showed on Tuesday.
""The deceleration in capital spending is likely to become stronger in the second half of the fiscal year,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.
""Production has fallen considerably so there are more moves to put off spending as it isn't seen as being necessary or urgent for the time being.""
Tuesday's sharp decline followed a 0.1% rise in the first three months of the year. On a seasonally-adjusted basis, capital expenditure lost 6.3% quarter-on-quarter in April-June.
The negative data will be used to calculate revised second-quarter gross domestic figures (GDP) due on Sept. 8 of the initial estimate for a 27.8% decline - with some economists expecting a downward revision based on Tuesday's data. 
While analysts expect the economy to fare better in the current quarter after the state of emergency was ended in late May, many forecast any rebound to be modest and a recovery to take years.
JOBLESS RATE EDGES UP
Japan's seasonally adjusted jobless rate ticked up to 2.9% in July, separate government data showed, compared to a median forecast for 3.0% in a Reuters poll of economists.
The jobs-to-applicants ratio slipped for the seventh straight month in July, dropping to 1.08 from 1.11 in the previous month to mark the lowest reading since April 2014 - meaning fewer than six jobs were available per five job-seekers.
Japan is also in the midst of a leadership change after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday he will step down due to worsening of a chronic illness, raising uncertainty about the outlook for monetary and fiscal policies.
The government expects the economy will recover to pre-coronavirus levels around the first quarter of 2022, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said last week.
The latest MOF survey showed manufacturers' business spending fell 9.7% from a year earlier, following a 5.3% drop in the previous quarter.
Corporate recurring profit tumbled 46.6% in the April-June quarter year-on-year, the biggest drop since the second quarter of 2009, due to declining demand for cars and other transportation goods.

Sales dropped 17.7% year-on-year in April-June, down for the fourth straight quarter to mark the biggest drop since January-March 2009.

1631,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 31, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","China's August export orders shake off COVID gloom, fuelling factory expansion: Caixin PMI","BEIJING(Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at the fastest clip in nearly a decade in August, bolstered by the first increase in new export orders this year as manufacturers ramped up production to meet rebounding demand, a private survey showed on Tuesday. 
The world's second-biggest economy has largely managed to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis, and the emerging bright spot in the forward-looking gauge of export orders could herald a more durable and broad-based recovery for the Chinese economy in the months to come. 
The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) rose to 53.1 last month from July's 52.8, marking the sector's fourth consecutive month of growth and the biggest rate of expansion since January 2011.
It beat analysts' forecasts for a slight dip to 52.6. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The upbeat findings contrasted with an official survey on Monday, which showed China's factory activity grew at a slightly slower pace in August as floods across southwestern China disrupts production, but there were positive signs in both PMIs.
The official PMI's improving trend in new export orders was similar to the private survey, while the former also showed solid growth in the crucial services sector in a boost to the economy's continued recovery from the coronavirus shock.
In Tuesday's Caixin, Chinese factories reported the first increase in new export orders this year in August as overseas countries eased COVID-19 restrictions to kick start their economies. The pick-up in business also led to a further expansion in production, marking the sharpest gain in almost a decade. 
The labour market also saw signs of improvement, with some companies increasing recruitment to meet production needs, although the gauge of employment continued to stay in negative territory for the eight straight month.
Wang Zhe, senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said a turning point is approaching for employment as factories' backlogs of work rose at a faster pace. 
""Employment remained an important focus. An expansion of employment relies on long-term improvement in the economy. Macroeconomic policy supports are essential, especially when there are still many uncertainties in domestic and overseas economies,"" said Wang, in a commentary accompanying the data release. 
A mirror factory in the Chinese city of Yiwu, which supplies to retail giants such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), has been inundated with new business beyond the factory's current operating capacity, with the management sending the entire sales team down to factory floors, a 23-year-old salesman at the company told Reuters. 
""We laid off workers when the pandemic first started but now, with this many orders, we cannot find enough people,"" said the salesman, adding that the firm was having issues booking shipments as finished goods piled up at their warehouses. 
Business optimism towards the year ahead among Chinese factories remained strong overall, although it dipped slightly in August. Firms are concerned about the severity of the global pandemic over the long term.

The world's third-largest economy is expected to see a modest bounce in the current quarter after a record slump in April-June as new coronavirus cases keep a lid on consumer sentiment and slow the overall recovery.
Tuesday's final au Jibun Bank Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to a seasonally adjusted 47.2 in August from 45.2 in July. It marked the slowest contraction since February, and also eclipsed a preliminary reading of 46.6.
""The easing of restrictions related to COVID-19 around the world helped to soften falls in key metrics such as production and new work,"" said Annabel Fiddes, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
But the pandemic continued to limit the performance of the sector as a whole, with firms feeling pressured to cut their prices due to relatively weak demand.
Another month of shrinkage in overall output and new orders held the headline index below the 50.0 threshold that separates contraction from expansion for a 16th month, matching a similar run through June 2009.
Many analysts expect only a modest third-quarter rebound, while a firmer recovery is expected to take time as a resurgence in global infections and uncertainty over the outlook for U.S.-China trade threaten overseas demand.
Japan is also dealing with a leadership issue after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced his resignation Friday due to the worsening of a chronic illness, stirring doubts about future fiscal and monetary stimulus policies.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura last week said he hoped the economy will recover to levels seen before the coronavirus around the first quarter of 2022.

""It is hoped that as economies around the world reopen and business operations normalise, this will feed through to... a recovery of Japanese manufacturing activity in the months ahead,"" said Fiddes.

That was the sharpest contraction since the final quarter of 2008 when the economy decreased by 3.3%.
The economy, Asia's fourth-largest, slipped into technical recession - two straight quarters of decline - in the June quarter, joining its peers Japan, Thailand and Singapore.
A 16.1% plunge in exports of goods and services was the biggest drag on the trade-reliant economy, though it was revised up from a July estimation of a 16.6% decline, still marking the worst contraction since the final quarter of 1963.

Figures from statistics office Istat showed household spending fell 11.3% in the period, and exports dropped 26.4%. Investment plunged 14.9%, with transport investment down about 20%. The economy shrank 12.8% in the three months, slightly worse than an initial estimate.
A strict national lockdown in Italy, the original European epicenter of the virus, took a heavy toll on the economy. The government forecasts that GDP will contract 8% in 2020, a projection that looks optimistic next to the 10% predicted by economists, and the European Commission’s 11%.
There’s also been a huge fallout on Italy’s public finances after the government ramped up health and stimulus spending to counter the pandemic. Debt was already projected to exceed 150% of GDP this year even before the latest tranche of spending. The government has so far approved about 100 billion euros ($119 billion) in stimulus to try to save the economy.
Some of that money will come from Europe, with Italy expected to receive the biggest share of a 750 billion-euro recovery fund approved by European Union.

The world's second-biggest economy has largely managed to bounce back from the health crisis, though intensifying Sino-U.S. tensions over a range of issues and the global demand outlook remain a risk factor. 
The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) fell slightly to 51 in August from 51.1 in July, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday. It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts had expected it to pick up a touch to 51.2.
China's vast industrial sector is steadily returning to the levels seen before the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy, as pent-up demand, stimulus-driven infrastructure expansion and surprisingly resilient exports propel a recovery, but the recovery remains uneven.
A sub-index for the activity of small firms stood, however, at 47.7 in August, down from July's 48.6, with over half of them reporting a lack of market demand and more than 40% of them reporting financial strains, Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician with the NBS, said in a separate statement. 
""In addition, some companies in Chongqing and Sichuan reported an impact from the heavy rains and floods, resulting in a prolonged procurement cycle for raw materials, reduced orders and a pullback in factory production.""
The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, also showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 49.1 in August, improving from 48.4 a month earlier and suggesting a bottoming out in the contractionary trend after COVID hit. 
""The growth engine is now clear. Overseas demand will only pick up slowly and travel restrictions will only be relaxed if COVID-19 cases subside overseas. Until then China will rely more on its own for economic growth,"" said Iris Pang, Greater China chief economist at ING. 
Economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pick up in the industrial sector. Profits at China's industrial firms last month grew at the fastest pace since June 2018, data showed on Thursday.
SERVICES SHINE
Activity in the construction sector, a powerful domestic growth driver, also eased in August, likely due to the floods in Southern China. But analysts are confident that as the torrential rains recede, Beijing's infrastructure push - on the back of accommodative policies - would further bolster growth. 
The official non-manufacturing PMI, which includes services and construction sectors, rose to 55.2 from 54.2 in July, the NBS survey showed. 
Investment bank HSBC expects China's economy would grow by 5.4% in the third quarter year-on-year, followed by a 6.2% expansion in the fourth quarter, returning China's growth to pre-COVID levels. 
But some analysts fear that the recovery could stall, hurt by rising tensions between Washington and Beijing and as another wave of local infections returns in the winter. Moreover, the continued rise in the number of COVID-19 cases across many countries, led by India and the United States, remain a risk to the outlook. 
The economy, which grew 3.2% in the second quarter year-on-year, is set to expand 2.2% this year - the weakest in over three decades.
Capital Economics senior China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the services sector uptick suggested an encouraging broadening out of the recovery.

""This is consistent with our view that an investment-led rebound would eventually also shore up consumer sentiment and household spending, keeping the overall economic recovery on track.""

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 30, 2020 09:56PM ET</span>",Japan factory output up but retail sales down amid fragile recovery from pandemic,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's factory output rose in July at the fastest pace on record, driven by automobiles and car parts, signaling a gradual recovery from the blow delivered by the coronavirus pandemic.
But retail sales fell for a fifth straight month and at a somewhat faster pace, a worrying sign for private consumption, which accounts for more than half of the world's third-largest economy.
Monday's data underscored the fragility of an economy that suffered a record 27.8% contraction in the April-June quarter as the pandemic took a heavy toll on both domestic and external demand.
While analysts believe the economy has bottomed out after lockdowns were lifted in late May, they say any rebound will be modest amid worries about a second wave of infections.
""The bounce-back in factory output will run its course in August and we expect a pullback in production in October-December,"" said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Factory output will fluctuate from now on to settle in at about 90% of the pre-coronavirus crisis level,"" he said.
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) data showed Japan's industrial output grew 8.0% in July from the previous month, versus economists' median estimate of a 5.8% gain and following a 1.9% increase in June.
The growth rate was the fastest on record going back to 1978, the government said. 
It was also the second straight month of gains after having hit its lowest level in May since the global financial crisis. 
Manufacturers surveyed by METI expect output to increase 4.0% in August and grow 1.9% in September.
METI officials said industrial output will continue to improve but activity would remain below pre-crisis levels for some time. The officials said they were closely watching the impact of a resurgence in coronavirus infections. 
Compared with a year earlier, output was down 16.1%.
Highlighting weak consumer demand, however, retail sales fell 2.8% year-on-year in July, worse than a 1.7% drop seen by economists in a Reuters poll and following a 1.3% drop in June, separate METI data showed on Monday.
Declines in car demand dragged down overall retail sales, and department stores and supermarkets suffered from sluggish consumer activity amid a surge in new COVID-19 cases.
Clothing demand also suffered, while oil product sales fell reflecting declines in crude oil prices, the data showed.

On a seasonally-adjusted basis, retail sales fell 3.3% month-on-month in July, posting the first drop in three months.

Industrial production in July rose by a seasonally-adjusted 1.6% from a month earlier, Statistics Korea said on Monday, down from 7.2% in June and slightly missing the median forecast of a 1.9% rise.
But the economic recovery may lose momentum as South Korea extended Phase 2 social distancing rules - the second-strictest level - for at least another week and toughened restrictions on some businesses to battle the resurgence of the virus in August.

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending rises strongly; outlook uncertain as fiscal stimulus fades,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending increased more than expected in July, boosting expectations for a sharp rebound in economic growth in the third quarter, though momentum is likely to ebb as the COVID-19 pandemic lingers and money from the government runs out.
The report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showed a rise in personal income after two straight monthly declines, but a chunk of the increase was from unemployment benefits, which were bolstered by a weekly $600 supplement from the government that expired on July 31. Both consumer spending and income remain well below their pre-pandemic levels. 
""The consumer is back spending at the shops and malls in July, but many of their purchases reflected pent-up demand following the pandemic lockdown,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The expenditures needed to fuel the economy's recovery in August are a big question mark given the hit to personal income nationwide with the loss of those $600 weekly unemployment benefit checks.""
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 1.9% last month, after jumping 6.2% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would gain 1.5% in July. July's increase left consumer spending about 4.6% percent below its February level.
Consumers boosted purchases of goods like new motor vehicles. They also lifted spending on healthcare, dining out and hotel and motel accommodation. While spending on goods has rebounded above its pre-pandemic level, outlays on services are about 9.7% from recovery as consumers remain wary of exposure to the coronavirus. 
That is a bad omen for the services-based economy, which fell into recession in February. Though new COVID-19 infections have subsided after a broad resurgence through the summer, many hot spots remain, especially at college campuses that have reopened for in-person learning. 
The economy suffered its deepest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter, with consumer spending at the forefront of the decline in gross domestic product. While economists are anticipating a sharp rebound in GDP in the third quarter, led by consumer spending, they are cutting estimates for the fourth quarter.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher while the dollar (DXY) was down against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries rose.
CONDITIONS UNFAVORABLE
Americans in low-wage jobs have borne the brunt of the economic downturn. Though President Donald Trump extended the jobless benefit supplement, the payout was cut to $300 per week and funding for the program is expected to be depleted by September.
A handful of states are offering the extra unemployment benefit. Economists estimate the loss of the $600 could cut $50 billion from retail sales in August. At least 27 million people are on unemployment benefits.
A survey on Friday from the University of Michigan showed a modest gain in consumer sentiment this month. According to the survey, half of all consumers expected the economy to improve in the year ahead, but many of them viewed the overall economic conditions as unfavorable.
In July, income rose 0.4%, in part as the reopening of more businesses lifted wages. Income fell 1.0% in June. It remains 5% below February's level. Wages gained 1.3%.
Unemployment assistance paid out $1.364 trillion last month, down from $1,470 in June. Economists expect the reduced unemployment benefits supplement will cut income by about $70 billion in August. 
With the saving rate at a lofty 17.8%, some believe consumer spending will remain supported for the rest of the third quarter. But others say worries about the economy and the virus' persistence could make consumers reluctant to dip into savings. The saving rate slipped from 19.2% in June. 
""It's important to note that the pace of decline in the savings rate has slowed markedly,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Beyond the mechanical third-quarter rebound, more timely figures confirm that the demand recovery has lost some momentum."" 
Prospects for third-quarter GDP growth were boosted by another report from the Commerce Department on Friday showing retail inventories rebounding 1.2% in July after declining for several months. That could offset a drag from rising imports, which led to the goods trade deficit widening 11.7% to $79.3 billion in July. Imports increased 11.8%, matching the gain in exports.
July's solid increase in spending boosted monthly consumer prices, though overall inflation remained muted. The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out a sweeping rewrite of its mandate, putting new weight on the labor market and less on worries about too-high inflation.

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.3% in July, matching June's advance. In the 12 months through July, the so-called core PCE price index climbed 1.3% after increasing 1.1% in June. The core PCE index is the preferred inflation measure for the Fed's 2% target, which is now a flexible average.

While remaining well below pre-crisis levels and the long-term average, the monthly indicator which gauges confidence in the economy soared to 87.7 points from 82.4 in July, above the 85.0 point average forecast of economists polled by Reuters.
The new pick-up, confirming the gradual rebound from May, was driven mostly by higher optimism in the service sector, the largest in the 19-country currency bloc. It remains in negative territory, but rose to -17.2 in August from -26.2 in July.
Confidence also rose in the industry and retail trade sectors, although factory managers' production expectations edged down after three consecutive monthly increases that pulled them to above pre-crisis levels.
Consumer confidence posted a slight recovery to -14.7 points from -15.0, confirming preliminary estimates released by the Commission earlier in August.
Consumer price expectations edged down, with a slightly higher appetite for major purchases in the coming twelve months, and a slight reduction in such major spending for now, the survey showed.
The employment expectations indicator continued to improve for the fourth month running, while confidence in the construction sector slightly worsened. 

Among the bloc's largest economies, sentiment improved markedly in France, the Netherlands and Germany. It also rose in Italy, but it fell in Spain.

Spending in France increased 0.5% from the previous month, far below the 1.2% expected by economists. The figures came alongside a report showing the economy shrank 13.8% in the second quarter, unrevised from an initial estimate.
In Spain, retail sales dropped almost 4% year-on-year, in the fifth straight monthly decline. A lack of tourists because of the pandemic has been a huge hit to the economy, with the biggest decline in sales seen in holiday regions such as Mallorca and Ibiza.
Economies across Europe bounced back strongly once restrictions to contain infections were lifted, but the big question is the longer-term sustainability of the recovery.
A recent acceleration in the daily count of coronavirus cases in several countries is adding to worries and may keep consumers at home. It also increases the risk that governments will put in place more restrictions. From Friday, mask-wearing is obligatory on the streets of Paris.
The other major risk is unemployment. Governments spent billions of euros on measures to protect workers’ incomes and help businesses, but that aid won’t last forever, and job cuts could mount. That would also hit household confidence and could push people to hold on to savings accrued during lockdown rather than spend the cash.
The Bank of France estimates households put aside an extra 80 billion euros ($95 billion) by the end of July, and that figure will likely rise to 100 billion euros by the end of the year.
Figures due later on Friday are forecast to show a pickup in euro-area economic confidence in August. While that keeps the recovery moving in the right direction, the index is still well below its pre-crisis level."
1644,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>","French savings surged, profits plunge in record second-quarter GDP slump: INSEE","PARIS (Reuters) - French household savings skyrocketed while businesses' profits plunged in the second quarter amid a coronavirus lockdown, the INSEE stats agency said on Friday, confirming the economy contracted 13.8% in the three months through June.
One of Europe's strictest lockdowns put the euro zone's second biggest economy into an unprecedented tailspin in the quarter. It had already contracted 5.9% in the previous three months. 
With most shops, cafes and hotels closed from mid-March to May 11, unspent cash pushed the household savings rate up to a record 27.4% of disposable income, while consumer spending - the traditional driver of the French economy - dropped 16.4% in the quarter.
Meanwhile, in the corporate sector, companies saw their profit margins fall to 26%, the lowest since the end of 1983, INSEE's data showed.
After most businesses were able to reopen in May, activity quickly surged, although there has been some signs that the catch-up is easing after the initial rebound.

Going into the third quarter, consumer spending rose 0.5% in July from June, slowing from a surge of 10.3% in June, INSEE said in a second release. That fell short of economists' average forecast for an increase of 2.0% in a Reuters poll.

1645,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Weaker German consumer morale casts some doubt on strong recovery,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer morale worsened heading into September, casting some doubt on whether household spending in Europe's largest economy is powerful enough to drive a strong recovery from the COVID-19 shock, a survey showed on Friday.
The GfK institute said its consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -1.8 heading into September from an upwardly revised -0.2 in the previous month.
The drop followed three consecutive increases from June to August. The reading missed a Reuters forecast for a rise to 1.2.
GfK consumer expert Rolf Buerkl pointed to a recent rise in new coronavirus infections and fear of another round of lockdown measures to slow down the spread of the disease, both of which were causing uncertainty and depressing the mood.
""The VAT cut that came into force on July 1 is supporting the propensity to consume, but it's currently not yet giving any stronger impulses,"" Buerkl said.
Germany's stimulus package includes a cut to value-added tax (VAT) for regular goods to 16% from 19% and for food and some other goods to 5% from 7% from July 1 until Dec. 31. The reduction is estimated to cost the federal government up to 20 billion euros ($23.6 billion).
The government hopes that its rescue and stimulus measures will help companies and consumers recover more quickly from the coronavirus shock which plunged the economy into its deepest recession on record in the second quarter.
The drop in consumer sentiment was mainly driven by falling income expectations while expectations for the development of the broader economy improved a fourth month in a row.
""Consumers are still expecting that the German economy can work its way out of the worst recession since the end of the war,"" Buerkl said.
But he cautioned that consumers' optimism would fade if the rise in new infections could not be stopped, forcing authorities to implement drastic measures or even a second lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. 
NOTE - The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month.
An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop in comparison with the same period a year ago.
According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1 percent in private consumption.
The ""willingness to buy"" indicator represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: ""Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?""
The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about the development of household finances in the coming 12 months.
The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned of the general economic situation in the next 12 months.

Lloyds (LON:LLOY) Bank's business barometer rose eight points to -14, the biggest monthly increase in three years and optimism about the economy and trading prospects showed similar increases.
Hann-Ju Ho, a Lloyds Bank economist, said the low levels of confidence, combined with the biggest contraction of the economy on record between April and June when it shrank by 20%, meant the shape of any recovered remains highly uncertain. 
""Nevertheless, it is encouraging to see gradual improvements in trading prospects and economic optimism, albeit from a low base,"" he said.
Surveys of purchasing managers published last week showed the recovery was gathering pace.
But economists say the bounce-back could prove short-lived with unemployment expected to rise as Britain's state-funded job subsidy scheme is wound down before its expiry on Oct. 31.
Lloyds said only 18% of businesses with staff still on furlough expected to be able to retain all of them.

1647,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 05:09PM ET</span>",China’s Economic Rebound Picks Up Speed on Car and Home Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s economy picked up speed in August as a strong industrial sector and stock market, better business confidence and home and car sales combined to boost the first economy globally to emerge from the Covid-19 slump.
That’s the assessment from the earliest available indicators, which showed China’s economy continuing to improve. The final result in July was also stronger than initially seen, given better results from purchasing manager indexes and more robust sales of homes and autos in the latter part of the month.
New home sales in China’s four biggest cities accelerated in the first three weeks of August, continuing July’s pickup. Car sales also are improving this month on the heels of July’s rebound as that market emerges from a two-year slump.
Still, even with better consumer confidence and spending, the broader retail sector remains sluggish. Without a strong rebound in dining out and shopping, retail is unlikely to return to strong growth.
More on Consumption
Conditions for small businesses continued improving in August, according to Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc, which surveys more than 500 smaller firms each month. Still, the improvement appears to be at a plateau, with the index for expectations dropping slightly.
“This suggests that the V-shaped post-Covid rebound may be nearing its limit, with growth approaching its potential level,” according to economists Shen Lan and Ding Shuang, who published the results. “SMEs’ new orders continued to increase in August, but that pace slowed for the first time since March.”
External conditions slowly improved as well. Average daily shipments from South Korea in the first 20 days of August fell 3.7%, significantly better than the double-digit declines seen in April through June. That suggests global trade is slowly gathering momentum.
South Korea’s exports serve as a barometer of global trade as its companies are closely linked to global manufacturing supply chains, and it releases data quickly.
China’s stocks have stalled since the the CSI 300 Index soared to a five-year high in mid-July. While still at a high level, the market is down 3% since that high amid tensions with the U.S. and as the People’s Bank of China moves to normalize monetary policy.
Early Indicators
From July, Bloomberg has changed some of the components for the early look at China’s economy, adding home sales in the biggest four cities, weekly car sales and inventories of steel reinforcing, while removing iron-ore prices, sales manager sentiment and property-related stocks.

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",U.S. Labor Department changes jobless claims data methodology after economic shock,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Labor Department said on Thursday it was changing the methodology used to address seasonal fluctuations in its weekly unemployment claims data, which economists complained was less reliable because of the economic upheaval caused by COVID-19.
The department said in a statement that starting next Thursday, it would use additive factors to seasonally adjust the initial claims and continued claims data instead of multiplicative factors.
""A multiplicative seasonal effect is assumed to be
proportional to the level of the series. A sudden large increase in the level of the series will be accompanied by a proportionally large seasonal effect,"" the department said. 
""In contrast, an additive seasonal effect is assumed to be unaffected by the level of the series.""
The coronavirus crisis has caused an unprecedented decline in economic activity, with nearly 7 million people filing new claims for unemployment benefits at one point. The Labor Department said in the presence of a large shift in the claims series, the multiplicative seasonal adjustment factors could result in systematic over-or under-adjustment of the data.
""In such cases, additive seasonal adjustment factors are preferred since they tend to more accurately track seasonal
fluctuations in the series and have smaller revisions,"" it said.
Economists welcomed the change in methodology.

""The change should address the issues that have plagued seasonally adjustments during this pandemic,"" said Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 27, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>",U.S. labor market recovery slowing; economists urge more fiscal stimulus,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hovered around 1 million last week, suggesting the labor market recovery was stalling as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on and financial aid from the government dries up.
The government also confirmed on Thursday that the economy suffered its sharpest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter because of the disruptions from the coronavirus, with corporate profits sinking deeper. 
Though new COVID-19 infections have subsided after a broad resurgence through the summer, many hot spots remain, especially at college campuses that have reopened for in-person learning. With the fiscal stimulus ebbing, signs are growing that the economy's recovery is slowing. Economists still expect a sharp rebound in growth this quarter, but they are dialing back estimates for the fourth quarter.
""This economy is not out of the woods yet,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Without federal government assistance it will take years for the services-based economy to generate employment opportunities for the workers unable to return to thousands of closed and bankrupt restaurants and bars and retail shops and malls across America.""
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 98,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.006 million for the week ended Aug. 22, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.0 million applications in the latest week.
The reopening of businesses in May pulled down claims from a record 6.867 million in March, when establishments were shuttered in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Claims fell below 1 million early this month for the first time since the pandemic started in the United States.
""The snail's pace of improvement in claims suggests that the next leg of the labor market's recovery will be much slower going,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte North Carolina. 
The COVID-19 crisis has altered the economic landscape and widened income inequality. The Federal Reserve on Thursday rolled out an aggressive new strategy to restore the nation to full employment and lift inflation back to healthier levels.
Stocks on Wall Street rose as investors cheered the Fed's new focus. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
Americans in low-wage occupations have borne the brunt of the recession, which started in February. A government-funded program offering businesses loans to help with wages has lapsed and a $600 weekly unemployment supplement expired on July 31.
Though President Donald Trump extended the supplement, the payout was cut to $300 per week and economists expect funding for the program to be depleted by September. A few states are offering the extra unemployment benefit. 
Economists estimate the loss of the $600 could cut $50 billion from retail sales in August.
""The spending made possible by the $600 was supporting 5.1 million jobs,"" said Heidi Shierholz, director of policy at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. 
The claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 223,000 to 14.535 million in the week ending Aug. 15. The so-called continuing claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed households for August's unemployment rate.
Though continuing claims declined between the July and August survey periods, economists expect the unemployment rate remained above 10% this month. Part of the decrease in continuing claims was likely because of people exhausting eligibility for benefits. 
At least 27 million people were receiving unemployment benefits under all programs in the week ended Aug. 8. 
In a separate report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said gross domestic product plunged at a 31.7% annualized rate last quarter, the deepest drop in output since the government started keeping records in 1947. That was revised from the 32.9% pace reported last month and reflected less steep declines in consumer spending and inventory accumulation than initially estimated. 
Graphic: Consumer spending contribution to U.S. GDP https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/gjnpwaawopw/gdp.png
After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment dropped at a rate of 11.7%. Profits decreased at a pace of 13.1% in the first quarter. They fell 20.8% year-on-year. 
Profits of domestic financial corporations rebounded $39.5 billion last quarter. Domestic non-financial corporations' profits fell $170.1 billion and profits from the rest of the world dropped $96.2 billion.
When measured from the income side, the economy contracted at a 33.1% rate in the last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) declined at a rate of 2.5% in the January-March period. 
The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, decreased at a 32.4% rate last quarter. That compared to a 3.7% pace of decline in the first three months of the year.
""With a health solution still out of reach and the economic rebound looking fragile, fiscal stimulus is urgently needed to prevent the economy from sliding back into a downturn,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.

The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, rose 5.9% to 122.1 last month. Contracts increased in all four regions last month.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, gaining 3% in July. Pending home sales surged 15.5% from a year ago. 
The housing market is being powered by record low interest rates and a migration to low-density residential areas as companies allow employees to work from home.

INSEE, the official statistics agency, said its monthly business sentiment index rose to 91 from 84, reaching its highest since March, when midway through the month the government put France under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe.
Business confidence has rebounded since the government began lifting the lockdown on May 11 as companies struggled to respond to pent-up demand from clients.
INSEE said that the survey showed business' leaders personal outlooks had eased in August despite the overall improvement, suggesting that much of the recovery in activity had already run its course.
""The speed of the catch-up could as a result slow in the coming months,"" INSEE said in a note accompanying the survey.
The overall rebound in business confidence came as the government struggled this month to contain a surge in new COVID-19 cases as the French went on summer holiday.
That has fuelled fears of a second wave of infections heading into the winter, which could derail France's economic recovery after a record recession in the first half of the year.

In a second quarterly survey, INSEE said that industrial companies had indicated they intended to cut investment this year by 11%, down from a reduction of 7% expected the last time the survey was conducted, in April.

Profits at China's industrial firms grew 19.6% on-year to 589.5 billion yuan ($85.58 billion), the statistics bureau said on Thursday, following an 11.5% increase seen in June, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data showed on Thursday.
China's recovery had been gaining momentum after the pandemic paralysed huge swathes of the economy as pent-up demand, government stimulus and surprisingly resilient exports revived activity.
However, some signs of weakness have emerged in July, with industrial output growing slower than expected. Some analysts said flood and torrential rain have dampened activity and demand for electricity.
Factories' profits also face risks from increasingly tense U.S.-China relationship ahead of the U.S. presidential elections in November, which could impact overseas orders and confidence from investors and consumers.
For January-July, industrial firms' profits fell 8.1% on an annual basis to 3.1 trillion yuan, improving from a 12.8% slump in the first six months.
Automobiles and electronics industries notched up significant recoveries in profits in July, seeing growth rates of 125.5% and 38.6% respectively, according to Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau.
Despite the acceleration in profits in July, accumulated profit declines in the mining and raw materials industries remain large, company cash flow pressures are high, and a ""complex and severe"" environment at home and abroad means that future profit growth has a degree of uncertainty, said Zhu. 
Profit growth was mainly driven by higher margins, with reveune growth slowing modestly from June, said analysts from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a note.
Earnings at China's state-owned industrial firms were down 23.5% on an annual basis for the first seven months of the year, versus a 28.5% decline in the first half of the year, the statistics bureau data showed.
Liabilities at industrial firms rose 6.5% on-year at end-July, up from a 6.4% growth as of end-June.
Private sector profits fell 5.3% in January-July, narrowing from January-June's 8.4% fall.

Companies reliant on spending by consumers - many of which only reopened in recent weeks after the lockdown - cut jobs at the fastest pace on record, according to a survey published on Thursday by the Confederation of British Industry.
Business and professional services firms reported the steepest declines since May 2009.
Companies expected job losses to slow slightly in the next three months but the CBI said government action was urgently needed.
""As we head into the autumn, the UK needs a bold plan to protect jobs as the job retention scheme draws to an end, to support the services sector,"" CBI economist Ben Jones said.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak has rejected calls to extend his huge Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme beyond Oct. 31. Since the start of this month employers have had to pay a share of its costs.
Britain's unemployment rate is expected to almost double to 7.5% by the end of 2020, according to the Bank of England, and many economists think it will go higher than that.
The CBI survey showed volumes of business dropped less severely than in the three months to May and companies expected the pace of decline to moderate further in the coming months.
Business and professional services firms were holding up better than companies in consumer services, but Jones said they faced additional uncertainty over Britain's unresolved future trading relationship with the European Union.
Business and professional services reported a small uptick in sentiment, and confidence fell at a slower pace among consumer services firms after a record plunge in the three months to May.

But the outlook for investment intentions remained bleak. Business and professional firms expected to cut back on vehicles, plant and machinery, land and buildings and training over the next 12 although IT investment was expected to rise.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased in July, though the pace slowed from June's robust gain, suggesting the rebound in business investment would be gradual amid uncertainty about the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The report from the Commerce Department on Wednesday showed an uneven recovery in investment as the coronavirus crisis shifts spending away from equipment used in the services industries such as restaurants and bars to purchases of goods like home electronics. 
""While orders are nearly back to their pre-pandemic levels, the slowing pace of gains suggests it will take a while for activity to fully recover,"" said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. 
""We do not expect business investment to reach its pre-pandemic level before mid-2022.""
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, increased 1.9% last month. These so-called core capital goods orders jumped 4.3% in June, which was the largest gain in six years. 
Core capital goods orders are slightly below their pre-pandemic level. They fell 1.9% on a year-on-year basis in July. Last month's rise in orders matched economists' expectations.

Though new coronavirus cases have subsided after a broad resurgence following the reopening of businesses in May, the path of the pandemic remains unclear, with many hot spots remaining. There are growing signs that the economy's recovery from the pandemic is slowing or even reversing.
At least 28 million people are on unemployment benefits and bankruptcies are rising as government aid rolled out at the start of the pandemic dries up. Regional Federal Reserve surveys showed a moderation in factory activity in the New York state and the mid-Atlantic regions this month. Consumer confidence fell to a six-year low in August.
""The trends in economic indicators have not changed significantly,"" economists at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities wrote in a research note. ""We likely need to see daily COVID-19 cases decline much more significantly in order for gains in economic activity to accelerate meaningfully.""
The economy slipped into recession in February.
Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar (DXY) was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.
LEAN ORDER BOOKS
Core capital goods orders last month were supported by demand for machinery, fabricated metals products, computers and electronic products and electrical equipment, appliances and components. Unfilled core capital goods orders edged up 0.1%. That followed a 0.2% gain in June. 
""The recovery remains uneven between investment that complements COVID-life and that which does not,"" said Sarah House, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Computers and communications orders have surpassed their February levels, while orders for machinery and metals continue to dig out from the hole left by shutdowns and more muted profit outlooks."" 
Shipments of core capital goods increased 2.4%. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. They shot up 3.8% in June, but remain 0.4% below their February level.
The shuttering of nonessential businesses in mid-March and a collapse in oil prices helped to undercut business investment, which was already under pressure from the Trump administration's trade war with China. 
Business investment tumbled at a record 27% annualized rate in the second quarter, with spending on equipment collapsing at an all-time pace of 37.7%. Investment in equipment has now contracted for five straight quarters. 
Economists expect the government will report a historic drop in corporate profits in the second quarter on Thursday when it publishes its second estimate of GDP for the last quarter.
Orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, surged 11.2% in July after advancing 7.7% in June. Durable goods orders have recouped losses suffered during the shutdown and are almost back at their pre-pandemic level. 
Durable goods orders were boosted by robust demand for motor vehicles, which powered ahead 21.9% after accelerating 85.6% in June. There were no orders reported for civilian aircraft. Orders for transportation equipment jumped 35.6% last month after rising 19.7% in June. Motor vehicles have a bigger weighting in the transportation category. 
Boeing (N:BA) reported no aircraft orders in July after receiving only one in June. The planemaker has struggled with cancellations as airlines grapple with sharply reduced demand for air travel because of the pandemic. 
The grounding of Boeing's best-selling 737 MAX jets since March 2019 after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia has also weighed on the company.

Unfilled durable goods orders fell 0.8% in July after declining 1.4% in June. Durable goods inventories fell 0.5%.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",French consumer confidence holds steady in August,"PARIS (Reuters) - French consumer confidence held steady in August as unemployment fears eased further in the euro zone's second-biggest economy, a survey from the INSEE statistics agency showed on Wednesday.
INSEE's consumer confidence index held at 94, unchanged from July and in line with the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 14 economists.
Households' concerns about unemployment fell to their lowest level since April when France was still in a two-month coronavirus lockdown that ended May 11.
France has avoided a major spike in permanent unemployment as companies put workers on state-subsidised furloughs en masse.
While households' general economic outlook was stable, it remained far below the survey's long-term average. The number of people who said it was a good time to save money rose while those prepared to make big purchases fell.
With most stores and restaurants closed, French households built up an extra 100 billion euros ($118 billion) in savings during the lockdown.

The government wants to convince consumers to spend the cash to fuel a recovery after France's worst post-war recession in the first half of the year.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer confidence at six-year low; underscores concerns about economic recovery,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence dropped to a more than six-year low in August as households worried about the labor market and incomes, casting doubts on the sustainability of the economy's recovery from the COVID-19 recession. 
The second straight monthly decrease in consumer confidence reported by the Conference Board on Tuesday overshadowed an acceleration in new single-family home sales to a more than 13-1/2-year high in July. The housing market continues to show strong immunity to the coronavirus crisis. 
The ebb in confidence followed the expiration of a $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement on July 31 and a flare-up in new coronavirus infections across the country, which forced some jurisdictions to shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. Though new cases have subsided, hot spots remain. 
""Today's data are telling us that while some lucky workers are able to buy new homes, millions of others are unable to afford life's necessities and pay the rent especially after the federal government canceled those $600 checks,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The consumer is the most worried they have been all year which pours cold water on the idea that the economic recovery is sustainable."" 
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 84.8 this month, the lowest since May 2014, from 91.7 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index edging up to a reading of 93 in August.
The survey's present situation measure, based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions, tumbled to a reading of 84.2 this month from 95.9 in July. The expectations index based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business and labor market conditions dropped to 85.2 from a reading of 88.9 in July.
The survey's so-called labor market differential, derived from data on respondents' views on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, deteriorated to a reading of -3.7 this month from 2.2 in July. That measure closely correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's employment report. 
It has dropped from as high as 38.3 in August last year, and fits in with views that the labor market recovery is losing speed after nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.763 million jobs in July after a record jump of 4.791 million in June. 
The share of consumers expecting an increase in income fell to 12.7% this month from 14.8% in July and the proportion anticipating a drop increased to 16.6% from 15.8% last month.
The weekly unemployment supplement has been cut to $300. Economists estimate the reduced unemployment benefits will slash about $50 billion from retail sales in August and restrain consumer spending, the main driver of the economy. 
""We are clearly in the second phase of the recovery, driven by underlying fundamentals rather than purely the surge in activity as household reengaged,"" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. ""This reinforces our view that a V-shaped recovery will not happen, the U.S. economy is unlikely to recover all of its lost output until mid-2022.""
The economy slipped into recession in February. Gross domestic product contracted in the second quarter at its steepest pace in at least 73 years. 
Stocks on Wall Street were mixed after a three-day rally. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were down.
HOUSING SHINES
In a separate report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said new home sales rose 13.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000 units last month, the highest level since December 2006. New home sales are counted at the signing of a contract, making them a leading housing market indicator. 
Economists had forecast new home sales, which account for about 13% of housing market sales, gaining 1.3% to a rate of 785,000-units. The housing market is being powered by record low interest rates and a migration to low-density residential areas as companies allow employees to work from home. 
Data last week showed a record jump in sales of previously owned homes in July. Homebuilding and permits also soared last month, while confidence among homebuilders increased in August to the highest level since December 1998. 
At least 28 million people are on unemployment benefits. Economists, however, say unemployment has disproportionately affected low-wage workers, who are typically renters. 
In July, new home sales increased in the Midwest, South and West. They fell in the Northeast. The median new house price increased 7.2% to $330,600 in July from a year ago. 
There were 299,000 new homes on the market, down from 304,000 in June. At July's sales pace it would take 4.0 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 4.6 months in June.

""Given most people who can afford a new home are higher-paid workers who still have their jobs, we should expect this trend to continue,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 25, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>","UK retailers cut jobs by most since 2009, CBI says","By David Milliken
LONDON (Reuters) - British retailers have cut the most jobs since the depths of the financial crisis and expect the pace of losses to accelerate, the Confederation of British Industry said, adding to warning signs of an expected sharp rise in unemployment.
Tuesday's data also showed an unexpected drop in sales this month, which contrasted with a recent pick-up in demand by consumers after the coronavirus lockdown was lifted. 
""Trading conditions for the retail sector remain tough,"" CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said.
""...Firms will be wary of deteriorating household incomes and the risk of further local lockdowns potentially hitting them in the pocket for a second time.""
Well-known British retailers Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), Debenhams  and WH Smith (L:SMWH) have announced job losses in recent weeks, reflecting a shift in demand to online sales during the pandemic.
 Tesco  (L:TSCO), Britain's biggest supermarket, said on Monday it would create 16,000 permanent roles to meet a surge in home deliveries.
Quarterly CBI figures showed the employment balance - which measures job changes over the past 12 months - sank to -45 in August from -20 in May, reaching its lowest since February 2009. A deeper fall is expected later this year.
The drop in the monthly retail sales balance was unexpected, falling to -6 in August from July's 15-month high of +4 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Figures last week showed the volume of retail sales rose above pre-pandemic levels in July. 
Howard Archer, an economist with forecasters EY Item Club, said he still thought consumer spending was headed for a substantial rebound in the third quarter.
""However, the weaker-than-expected August CBI survey is a reminder that there is considerable uncertainty as to just how willing and able consumers will be to spend beyond the third quarter,"" he said. ""Indeed, persistent consumer caution is seen as a significant risk that could limit the UK recovery.""
Retailers in the CBI survey said spending in August was 27% below normal compared with a 79% shortfall in June - a disparity not shown in other figures, which may reflect how social distancing requirements have had a much bigger impact on some sectors - such as high street clothing retailers - than others.

The CBI survey was based on responses from 63 retail chains collected between July 28 and Aug. 14.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investments and exports all collapsed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the statistics office said on Tuesday.
The economic slump was much stronger than during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, and it represented the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970, the office said.
Still, the reading marked a minor upward revision from an earlier estimate for the April-June period of -10.1% that the office had published last month.
Consumer spending shrank by 10.9% on the quarter, capital investments by 19.6% and exports by 20.3%, seasonally adjusted data showed.
Construction activity, normally a consistent growth driver for the German economy, fell by 4.2% on the quarter.
""The second quarter was a complete disaster,"" VP Bank economist Thomas Gitzel said. ""Regardless of whether it is about investments, private consumption, exports or even imports -everything was in free fall.""
The only bright spot was state consumption, which rose by 1.5% on the quarter due to the government's coronavirus rescue programmes, the office said.
The German parliament has suspended the debt brake this year to allow the government to finance its crisis response and fiscal stimulus push with record new debt of 217.8 billion euros.
The fiscal U-turn after years of balanced budgets means that the German state recorded a budget deficit of 51.6 billion euros from January to June, the statistics office said in a separate statement.
That represents a deficit of 3.2% of economic output as measured by the EU's Maastricht criteria.
Employment edged down by 1.3% on the year to 44.7 million in as sign that the government's efforts to shield the labour market from the coronavirus shock with its short-time work programme are paying off.
The relatively mild impact of the crisis on employment helped to stabilize income for many households, which together with the reluctance to consume, led to a considerable increase in household saving.
The savings rate almost doubled to 20.1% in the 2nd quarter compared to the previous year, the office said.
The German central bank expects household spending to drive a strong recovery in the third quarter, though the economy might not reach its pre-crisis level before 2022.
The government's stimulus measures include a temporary VAT cut from July to December worth up to 20 billion euros, which Berlin hopes will give household spending an additional push.
""The reopening of the economy will give the German economy a strong boost in the period from July to September,"" Gitzel said, but he added that the moment of truth would come in the autumn and winter months, which could see a wave of bankruptcies.

""In addition, the negative consequences of structural change in the automobile industry are becoming increasingly evident,"" Gitzel said, pointing to many small suppliers in the sector that are struggling to adapt to digitisation and electrification.

1665,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 11:35PM ET</span>","Australian employment falls further, intensifying labor market stress","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian employment fell by 1% over the month to Aug. 8, data showed on Tuesday, with job prospects particularly hard hit in the southeastern state of Victoria as it grapples with a fresh wave of coronavirus infections.
The latest fall in employment underlines the deepening cracks in the labour market, with the government predicting unemployment in the country would climb above 13% by the end of September, from a 22-year high of 7.5% in July.
Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed payroll jobs for the period fell 2.8% in Victoria, which has suffered the biggest decline in employment since mid-March when Australia recorded its 100th coronavirus case.
The release, an experimental weekly series, differs from the monthly official employment data and is based on wage payment figures from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
Economists said Tuesday's numbers are a cause for concern as they showed jobs growth had stalled after a sharp rebound in recent months.
""Obviously Victoria isn't helping and weakness across Victoria may have spilled over to other states,"" said Callam Pickering, economist at global job site Indeed.
""Policymakers will need to be proactive in the coming months and there should be concern that rates of JobSeeker and JobKeeper are being reduced when unemployment remains so high.""
About 1.3 million Australians have applied for the COVID jobless benefit, called JobSeeker, according to government figures. 
Economists estimate at least another 6 million people - a quarter of the population - are having their wages subsidised by a separate relief package for shuttered companies called JobKeeper.

""Clearly many Australian businesses are in a precarious position and that is reflected in their hiring decisions,"" Pickering said.

1666,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 24, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>","Australia’s Recession Will Extend Into Third Quarter, CBA Says","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s recession will extend into a third quarter, making it the longest slump since 1982-83, and unemployment remain elevated next year due to a tepid recovery, according to Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY).
It predicts gross domestic product will fall 0.7% in the current quarter after declining 6% in the prior period; the economy contracted 0.3% in the first three months of the year. Australia’s jobless rate is forecast to peak at 9% in the final months of this year and then average 8.8% through 2021, the bank said.
“Courtesy of the large roll the Commonwealth Bank plays in the Australian economy we can see the most recent deterioration in the labor market,” said Stephen Halmarick, chief economist at the nation’s largest lender. “A large number of people have, once again, found themselves without employment and have had to either start, or restart, receiving the JobSeeker payment.”
The downward revisions to the bank’s forecasts reflects a renewed lockdown in Victoria state, accounting for about a quarter of GDP, which will drag on the national performance. The Reserve Bank of Australia, in its updated forecasts released earlier this month, sees the economy basically flat in the current quarter and expects unemployment to peak at 10% later in the year.
CBA expects only a “modest recovery” in the economy in 2021, forecasting GDP to rise just 1.8% from a year earlier. It predicts the economy won’t return to its pre-Covid level until the second half of 2022 “at the earliest.”
On a more positive note, China’s role as first nation to fall victim to the virus and first to recover means its stimulus measures are driving demand for the chief ingredient in steel, iron ore, which is Australia’s largest export. CBA forecasts the price will average a still high $110 a ton in the fourth quarter -- from $129 at present -- and then ease back to $90 a ton late next year.
Halmarick also highlighted the surge in income since the onset of Covid-19, reflecting the Australian government’s substantial stimulus program. Indeed, total income flowing into CBA bank accounts is now a little over 20% higher than it was this time last year, he said.
While some of that is being spent, a lot is also being saved, he says. CBA’s average total savings balance per household, including home lending related savings and transaction or savings accounts, was up 14% in July from a year earlier.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil posted its strongest July job growth in eight years, official figures showed on Friday, snapping four consecutive months of job losses as the country continued to relax the coronavirus-fighting lockdown measures from earlier in the year.
The addition of a net 131,010 formal jobs in July was driven by industry and construction, which together accounted for over 70% of the overall gains, followed by retail and agribusiness.
Services continued to shed jobs, the economy ministry said.
Over 1 million jobs were created, while 912,640 positions were lost.
July's figures followed a downwardly-revised 19,579 formal job losses in June, and brings the net loss in the first seven months of the year to 1.1 million.
Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said he was ""excited"" by the ""extraordinary"" figures.
A 'V-shaped' recovery is possible, Guedes said, adding that the job numbers justified a recent wave of economists revising their 2020 gross domestic product forecasts upward.
""Revisions are now confirming that GDP may fall 4%, just over 4%, practically half of what had been predicted before,"" he told reporters in Brasilia.
Work and Pensions Secretary Bruno Bianco said the government would extend for another two months a program that allows firms to reduce workers' hours or suspend contracts, in return for keeping them on the payroll.
More than 16 million workers and 1.4 million employers have been involved in the program so far, Bianco said, adding that only 23.2 billion reais out its 51.6 billion reais budget had been spent.
The latest official unemployment statistics show the jobless rate rose to a three-year high of 13.3% in the three months to June. But underlying figures paint a far more precarious picture.
A record number of Brazilians are out of the workforce completely, a record low number as a share of the working population - less than 50% - have a job, and the underemployment rate surged to an all-time high.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Signs of recovery? U.S. business activity and home sales surge,"By Dan Burns
(Reuters) - In signs an economic recovery may be picking up speed, U.S. home sales rose at a record rate for a second straight month in July, and purchasing managers in both the manufacturing and services sectors report business activity has accelerated at a brisker-than-expected pace this month. 
With mortgage rates holding near record lows and a work-from-home trend apparently enticing many Americans to move further from city centers, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday sales of existing homes rose 24.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.86 million units last month from 4.7 million in June.
Home prices also shot to a record $304,100, and a shortage of inventory is making competition for houses fierce. The average time on the market fell to 22 days in July, a record low, from 24 in June, and nearly 70% sold in less than a month.
Combined with June's 20.2% gain, home sales have mushroomed by nearly 50% in two months to fully retrace the cratering in residential real estate activity in the spring after the COVID-19 pandemic started spreading across the country. July's sales rate was the fastest since December 2006, when the country was in the latter stages of the sub-prime mortgage housing boom.
“The housing market is well past the recovery phase and is now booming with higher home sales compared to the pre-pandemic days,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “With the sizable shift in remote work, current homeowners are looking for larger homes and this will lead to a secondary level of demand even into 2021.”
Graphic: Existing home sales https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/dgkvllwbbvb/ehs.png
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales rising 14.7% to a rate of 5.38 million units in July. Existing home sales, which make up about 85% of U.S. home sales, rose in all four regions and were up 8.7% nationally from a year earlier.
The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is at an average of 2.99%, hovering near levels last seen in the early 1970s, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). Data earlier this week showed homebuilding accelerating by the most in nearly four years in July. 
Housing has been a bright spot in the economy even as other sectors suffer amid widespread coronavirus infections that have slowed commerce and kept unemployment high. More than 28 million people were collecting jobless benefits under all programs at the end of July.
The pandemic tipped the economy into recession in February, ending a record-long expansion that had brought U.S. unemployment to a 50-year low.
BACK TO BUSINESS?
Meanwhile, a purchasing managers' survey showed U.S. business activity snapped back to the highest since early 2019 in August as companies in both the manufacturing and services sectors saw a resurgence in new orders even as new COVID-19 cases remain stubbornly high across the country.
Data firm IHS Markit said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Index rose to a reading of 54.7 this month - the highest since February 2019 - from 50.3 in July. Its flash - or preliminary - indicator for the manufacturing sector stood at its highest since January 2019 and for the services sector it was the highest since March 2019.
A reading above 50 indicates growth in private sector output.
Graphic: Markit PMI https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/qmyvmaobavr/markit.png 
""Driving the overall upturn in output was stronger client demand,"" Markit said in its report. ""Total new business rose for the first time since February and at a solid rate. Manufacturing firms registered a steeper expansion in new order inflows than in July, while service providers signaled a renewed increase in sales.""
The survey's flash composite new orders index climbed to 54 in August - the highest since March 2019 - from a final reading of 49.7 in July. Foreign sales increased at the fastest rate since September 2014, it said, as more non-U.S. markets reopened their economies.
The improvement in the PMI and home sales data comes even as U.S. coronavirus infections continue to climb, and some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions this summer have been forced to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. As of Aug. 20, more than 5.5 million U.S. cases cumulatively had been recorded since the pandemic began, according to a Reuters tally, up from around 4.6 million at the end of July.
The unexpectedly sharp increases in Markit's indexes and home sales continue a pattern of choppy U.S. economic data that paint a picture of a fitful recovery from the COVID-19 recession, with pockets of both strength and weakness dotted across disparate portions of the economy and regions. 

On Thursday, for instance, the U.S. Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits shot back above the 1 million mark last week. Meanwhile, earlier in the week the government reported residential construction had accelerated by the most since October 2016 last month.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's economic recovery from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic has gathered pace, data showed on Friday, but government borrowing rose past the 2 trillion pound ($2.6 trillion) mark and fears of future job losses are mounting.
Retail sales rose above pre-pandemic levels in July, the first full month for many shops reopening after lockdown, and August's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data showed the fastest growth in almost seven years.
But Britain's economy still faces a long recovery after shrinking by a record 20% in the second quarter, the largest decline of any big country. 
""The UK is still seeing a V-shape bounce in activity. But ... a hot summer can quickly turn to a cold autumn,"" HSBC economist Liz Martins said, pointing to a softening in euro zone business activity as coronavirus cases begin to rise again.
Retail sales in July were 1.4% above year-ago levels and 3.0% above their level before the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics said.
August's preliminary composite PMI, which covers most businesses outside retail, hit its highest level since October 2013.
But employers are increasingly planning to shed jobs and were making staff redundant rather than bringing them back from a government-subsidised furlough scheme that expires in October.
""Scarring from the pandemic and lingering doubts about the sustainability of recovery resulted in a need to cut overheads,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, which compiles the PMIs.
The Bank of England forecasts unemployment will reach 7.5% by year-end, almost double its most recent reading. 
Separately, the Confederation of British Industry said manufacturing orders were ""severely depressed"", with little improvement in August.
Stuttering PMI surveys for the euro zone -- where countries exited lockdown earlier than Britain -- suggested the boost from pent-up demand was already fading. 
JOB LOSSES
Retail sales are only part of overall household spending. A GfK survey showed no improvement in consumer confidence since early July.
Within retail, different businesses have had contrasting fortunes. Grocery sales are 3% up on the year and online sales are 50% higher than before the pandemic. But sales volumes at clothing and footwear stores are 25% lower than last year.
Stores including Marks & Spencer, Boots and John Lewis [JLPLC.UL] have announced plans for major job cuts.
Friday's data also laid bare the impact of increased public spending and a slide in tax revenues on the public finances.
Public sector net debt exceeded 2 trillion pounds in July for the first time, and is its highest since 1961 as a share of gross domestic product.
Government borrowing so far this financial year is 150.5 billion pounds, almost seven times higher than in the same period in 2019 though below the 178.8 billion pounds Britain's budget forecasters predicted last month. 
The government has spent more than 35 billion pounds so far on its job support scheme, the largest single measure to tackle the economic impact of the pandemic.
Government figures showed 6.8 million jobs were furloughed at the end of June, down from 8.9 million in early May.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone's recovery from its deepest economic downturn on record hit the brakes in August, particularly in services, as pent-up demand unleashed by the easing of coronavirus lockdowns dwindled, a survey showed on Friday.
To contain the spread of the virus, which has infected over 22.5 million people globally, governments imposed strict lockdowns - forcing businesses to close and citizens to stay home, bringing economic activity to a near halt.
After many of those restrictions were relaxed, activity in the euro zone expanded in July at the fastest pace since mid-2018. But as infection rates have risen again in parts of the region, some earlier curbs have been reinstated.
So in data likely to concern policymakers and diminish hopes for a V-shaped recovery, IHS Markit's flash Composite Purchasing Managers' Index sank to 51.6 from July's final reading of 54.9, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that predicted no change.
""The fall back in the euro zone composite PMI in August suggests the initial V-shaped rebound following the lifting of the lockdowns is already fizzling out,"" said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.
The flow of incoming new business for firms slowed and once again some of August's activity was derived by businesses completing backlogs of work.
Germany and France, the bloc's two biggest economies, also lost economic momentum this month, driven by the services slowdown.
Apart from those economies, activity in the bloc decreased marginally in August, IHS Markit said.
In Britain, outside the currency union and who entered and exited lockdown later than its euro zone neighbours, the recovery from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic quickened again in August.

SERVICES STALL
Growth in the euro zone's dominant service sector stalled, with that PMI plummeting to 50.1 from 54.7, below all forecasts in the Reuters poll which predicted a small dip to 54.5.
With demand waning, the bloc's services firms cut headcount for a sixth month and more sharply than in July. 
Economists noted the employment components of the PMIs suggested trouble in the job market. 
""Those numbers indicate that the worst is yet to be seen in the euro area labour market and clearly points to a gradual recovery path,"" noted Tuuli Koivu at Nordea Markets.
Factory activity - which didn't suffer quite as sharp a decline as the service industry during the height of the pandemic - expanded for a second month.
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, rose to 55.7 from 55.3.
However, suggesting factory purchasing managers don't expect a big pick up in activity, they again bought fewer raw materials than in the previous month.
European Union leaders agreed last month a 750 billion euro pandemic recovery fund but the relief won't kick in until next year. For its part, the European Central Bank is expected to keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a long time.
A full bounceback from the euro zone's deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists. [ECILT/EU]

LONDON (Reuters) - The recovery among British businesses from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic quickened again in August, but snowballing job cuts sent an ominous signal for the months ahead, a survey showed on Friday.
The early reading of the IHS Markit/CIPS UK Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), covering the services and manufacturing sectors, shot up to a nearly seven-year high of 60.3 from 57.0 in July, far above the 50 threshold for growth.
A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of 57.1.
While the PMI indicated a further acceleration of growth, it did not signal a return to normal levels of output across businesses, which some economists think could take years.
""There were encouraging signs that customer-facing service providers have started to catch up with the rebound seen earlier this summer across the wider economy,"" said Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey.
He cited a further easing of lockdown measures and the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" scheme, which subsidises restaurant meals, as helping to boost growth during August.
Nonetheless, there were widespread worries among companies that the recovery might fade in the coming months, with the government's job protection scheme set to close at the end of October.
The PMI showed companies in both the services and manufacturing sectors cut jobs at a faster pace in August - echoing the almost daily announcements of lay-offs among many of Britain's biggest companies.
Economists polled by Reuters this month thought it would take at least two years for Britain's economy to recover the output lost during the pandemic, with a contraction of almost 10% in store for 2020. [ECILT/GB]
The PMI for the services sector, which comprises the bulk of Britain's economy, rose to a six-year high of 60.1 in August from 56.5 in July - again better than expectations for a reading of 57.0.
Still, business expectations for the year ahead cooled slightly as companies fretted over the outlook.

Factories reported a better August too. The manufacturing PMI rose by two points to 55.3, its highest level since February 2018.

The sharp slowdown shows that the path out of recession won’t be plain sailing, and undermines lingering hopes for a V-shaped recovery. While infections are on the rise, economic concerns mean governments are so far reluctant to re-impose the type of strict lockdowns seen earlier this year.
In a report published Friday, IHS Markit said its composite measure of private-sector activity dropped to 51.6 in August from 54.9 in July. The manufacturing gauge remained virtually unchanged, but services plunged to 50.1, a level that practically signals stagnation.
The economy had initially bounced back strongly after lockdowns were eased, though many were concerned that the pace could fade. At their last meeting in July, European Central Bank policy makers were reluctant to draw firm conclusions about the health of the economy, a stance that looks justified by Friday’s numbers.
The fallout on jobs in both sectors continued, with employment declining for a sixth straight month. That’s a key worry for governments, who fear a damaging rise in joblessness could persist for some time. While France and Germany, the euro area’s biggest economies, continued to see growth in activity, the Markit report suggested output declined in Italy and Spain.
“The euro zone stands at a crossroads,” said Andrew Harker, economics director at IHS Markit. “The path taken will likely depend in large part on how successfully Covid-19 can be suppressed and whether companies and their customers alike can gain the confidence necessary to support growth.”"

IHS Markit's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, fell to 53.7 from 55.3 in July.
The reading was still above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction, but it came in weaker than a Reuters poll of 55.0 and was the first drop after three months of gains.
The main drag came from the service sector, where the sub-index declined to 50.8 from 55.6.
Manufacturing proved more resilient with the subindex rising to 53.0 from 51.0, reaching its highest level in nearly two years.
IHS Markit economist Phil Smith said activity in the service sector was close to stalling amid renewed travel restrictions and a sustained decline in overall employment that was weakening domestic demand.
In manufacturing, further cuts to factory workforce numbers also showed that ""there is still ground to make up and businesses remain under pressure to cut costs"", Smith added.
The German economy, Europe's largest, contracted at its steepest rate on record in the second quarter as consumer spending, company investment and trade all collapsed during the peak of the pandemic.

Sentiment surveys and recent economic data had pointed to a quick, V-shaped recovery as long as another big wave of new infections and a nationwide lockdown can be avoided in the second half of the year.

Data compiler IHS Markit said its preliminary purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 51.7 points from 57.3 in July - far below the average forecast for 57.2 in a Reuters poll of economists.
The reading for the services sector stayed above the 50-point level dividing an expansion from a contraction, but the preliminary PMI reading for manufacturing came in below that level.
The dominant service sector saw its PMI reading for August fall to 51.9 points from 57.3 in July - below a forecast for a reading of 56.3 points.
The manufacturing PMI fell to 49.0 points in August - down from 52.4 in July and below a forecast for 53.7 points.
French business activity had surged after the euro zone's second-biggest economy emerged in May from one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe as firms responded to pent-up client demand.
The August PMI survey indicated that backlogs were no longer growing in the service sector and were growing at a slower pace in manufacturing. Meanwhile, new order flow was stable in services and slowed slightly in manufacturing, the survey showed.

The INSEE statistics agency said at the end of July that the French economy contracted by a post-war record of 13.8% in the second quarter due to the lockdown.

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",Japan's consumer prices mired as deflation spectre looms,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer prices were stubbornly unchanged in July, dashing hopes for a modest rise as the coronavirus pandemic hit household demand and revived fears of a national plunge back into deflation.
A slow economic recovery from last quarter's record slump is expected to weigh on prices as consumer demand collapsed amid resurgent infections, which will in turn hit profits, jobs and business investment, analysts say.
The spectre of a return to deflation will keep the Bank of Japan (BOJ) under pressure to continue massive monetary stimulus and maintain ultra-low interest rates to support government fiscal spending aimed at battling the health crisis.
Japan's core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, stood flat in July from a year earlier, data by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications showed on Friday.
It fell short of a median market forecast for a 0.1% rise, following a flat reading in June.
Drops in gasoline prices reflecting weak global demand for crude oil offset gains in food and household durable goods such as electric rice-cookers and air-conditioners, the data showed.
""Taken together, core CPI is likely to stay largely flat towards next year,"" said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities.
""Japan is in a deflationary situation. As we shift towards 'new normal' following the coronavirus, the BOJ's 2% inflation target is increasingly losing reality.""
The so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.4% in the year to July, maintaining the pace seen in the last two months.
The BOJ projects consumer prices to fall 0.5% this fiscal year to next March and stay well below its 2% target through early 2023.
The central bank holds its next policy-setting meeting Sept. 16-17.
Friday's data came after a batch of indicators confirmed weak demand at home and abroad, with exports posting a fifth consecutive month of double-digit falls and a surprise drop in core machinery orders pointing to fragile capital expenditure.
Japan's economy, the world's third-largest, suffered a record annualised contraction of 27.8% in April-June as lockdowns through late May aimed at containing the pandemic dampened business activity and crushed private consumption.

Analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest, with fears of a second wave of infections potentially hitting spending and prolonging a long stretch of deflation.

1680,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:27PM ET</span>",Job Loss Fears Keep U.K. Consumer Confidence Subdued in August,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. consumer confidence remained weak in August as the specter of unemployment hung over the British economy.
GfK’s key index of household sentiment, which plunged deep into negative territory after the lockdown imposed earlier this year triggered a record recession, was unchanged from July.
The lack of improvement came despite a further easing of the restrictions hampering the economy. Much of the apprehension can be attributed to worries about employment. The government began winding down its wage subsidy-program for furloughed workers this month, leading to warnings that millions of Britons risk losing their jobs unless Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak extends support beyond October -- a demand he has so far resisted.
“Employment is now the big issue because the pandemic has ended years of job security,” said GfK’s client strategy director, Joe Staton. Although consumers were slightly more confident about their personal finances in the next year, “this could change quickly when furlough ends and the inevitable redundancies start,” he warned.
The U.K. relies heavily on consumer spending for growth, so encouraging people to return to the shops is crucial to getting the economy back on its feet.
The government’s Eat Out to Help Out program, which picks up part of the tab on restaurant meals during August, has not translated to increased spending elsewhere, according to Staton.
“Yes, discounted dinners have proved a winner with hungry consumers across the country this month, but it’s difficult to see any increased appetite for other types of spending for now,” he said.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>","Britons a bit more upbeat on finances but worried about economy, GfK says","LONDON (Reuters) - British consumers turned a bit more confident about their personal finances in August, but they were increasingly worried about the outlook for the economy with unemployment expected to rise sharply, a survey showed on Friday.
The headline GfK consumer confidence index held at -27, the same level it has been since early July.
That represented its joint-highest reading since the coronavirus lockdown began in March, but is not far above its lowest level in a decade that was touched in May.
""Circumspect consumers report they are more confident about their personal financial situation over the next year but the uptick from zero to +1 does not amount to much,"" Joe Staton, GfK's client strategy director, said.
""This can change quickly when furlough ends and the inevitable redundancies start.""
Around one in eight workers remain on the government's job retention subsidy scheme which has already cost 35 billion pounds ($46 billion) and is due to close at the end of October.
A measure of how consumers view the economy over the next 12 months fell to -42 from -41 in July, GfK said.
Britain's economy shrank by more than 20% in the April-June period and the Bank of England thinks it will take until the end of next year for it to regain its pre-pandemic size. 
Some private-sector economists say it could take a lot longer than that, with the average forecast in a Reuters poll on Thursday showing that it would take at last two years for the economy to return to the same size it was at the end of 2019.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Rise in U.S. weekly jobless claims clouds labor market recovery,"By Dan Burns
(Reuters) - The number of Americans filing a new claim for unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly back above the 1 million mark last week, a setback for a struggling U.S. job market crippled by the coronavirus pandemic.
Still, in a sign some rehiring is underway, the rolls of those continuing to receive jobless benefits is slowly declining, the Labor Department reported on Thursday, and other data indicated a recovery from the recession triggered by COVID-19 continues, though at a more fitful pace than earlier.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 1.106 million for the week ended Aug. 15, from an upwardly revised 971,000 in the prior week. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 925,000 applications in the latest week.
The previous week's level had marked the first time since March that new claims had registered below 1 million, and had fueled some optimism that the pace of layoffs would slow further. Last week's reversal soured that, and new weekly claims have been above the 1 million mark for 21 of the last 22 weeks.
""The labor market is a long way from being healthy,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients.
The volatility in benefits activity follows the lapse of an extra $600 weekly unemployment benefit at the end of July. The enhanced benefit had been in place since the spring under the massive coronavirus stimulus package passed by Congress in late March, but Democrats in Congress and the White House have failed to reach agreement on extending it. 
While President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that includes a provision extending the supplement at a reduced rate of $400 a week, there has been confusion over its implementation.
States are required to cover $100 of the benefits, but many governors have indicated they don't have the financial capacity after revenues were decimated in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The remaining $300 will be funded from a limited emergency disaster relief program, which economists estimated could be depleted as early as September.
Oxford's Vanden Houten noted that only seven states have been approved to pay the extra benefits.
'LOSING STEAM'
New COVID-19 infections continue to spread across the nation, forcing authorities in some of the most afflicted areas to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. The newest twist in the path of the outbreak includes the eruption of hot spots associated with some colleges reopening their campuses. 
First-time claims peaked at a record 6.867 million in late March.
""Claims are still down 325,000 from the last full week of July,"" economists at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note to clients that described the overall increase as ""disappointing.""
""The next few weeks will be telling in terms of how much of the recent improvement has been fundamental as the Sun Belt has recovered from their COVID surge, or technical as the $600 benefit expired,"" the Jefferies economists said.
While new claims are up, the number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits beyond the first week fell to the lowest level since April. So-called continuing claims declined to 14.844 million in the week ending Aug. 8 from a revised 15.480 million in the prior week. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast continued claims at 15 million.
Including those enrolled in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides benefits for those out of work who would not ordinarily qualify for standard state jobless benefits, the total number of people receiving assistance was 28.06 million in the week ended Aug. 1, down roughly 200,000 from the prior week.
Only 9.3 million of the 22 million jobs lost between February and April have been regained so far, and the economy suffered its largest slump since at least the end of World War Two in the second quarter, contracting by nearly 33% at an annualized rate.
Nonetheless, two other reports on Thursday showed a recovery is underway, although the pace has slackened in recent weeks. 
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index showed the pace of activity growth in the mid-Atlantic region slowed for a second straight month in August.
The Philadelphia Fed's business index slid to a reading of 17.2 from 24.1 in July. A reading above zero indicates expansion. Economists polled by Reuters had been looking for a reading of 21.
And the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index rose 1.4% in July, following increases of 3.0% and 3.1% in June and May, respectively.

""Despite the recent gains in the LEI, which remain fairly broad-based, the initial post-pandemic recovery appears to be losing steam,"" said Ataman Ozyildirim, the Conference Board's senior director of economic research. ""The LEI suggests that the pace of economic growth will weaken substantially during the final months of 2020.""

Investing.com -- The number of Americans applying for initial unemployment benefits unexpectedly increased to 1.106 million last week, adding to fears that the recovery in the labor market is stalling. The prior week's figure was revised up to 971,000 from 963,000.
Economists had forecast a decline to 925,000. The number of people claiming Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for the first time also rose by 53,000 to 543,000, suggesting that the rate of layoffs remains high despite the gradual reopening of the economy.
The number of continuing claims, which are reported with a one-week lag to initial claims, decreased to 14.844 million. The previous week's figure was also revised downwards to 15.480 million.
Including another 12.5 million or so Americans who are claiming Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, the total number of people claiming unemployment benefits as of August 1st fell by some 200,000 to 28.06 million.
The data comes a day after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s July meeting showed that officials already see the rebound in the labor market slowing. The minutes also reiterated that the outlook for the economy hinges on the outlook for the virus.
The number of new coronavirus infections has eased markedly since last month, and is now at its lowest since June, but is still averaging over 40,000 a day, according to John Hopkins data.
The minutes also noted that since many provisions of the government's coronavirus fiscal relief package are due to expire while the labor market is still weak, ""additional fiscal aid would likely be important for supporting vulnerable families, and thus the economy more broadly, in the period ahead.""
Elsewhere, there was further evidence of the recovering flattening out as the Philadephia Federal Reserve's manufacturing index fell for a second straight month, and by more than expected, to 17.2.  The employment subindex fell particularly sharply, while capital spending and new orders held up slightly better.

1684,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 20, 2020 08:18AM ET</span>",ECB Signals September to Be Key Month to Read the Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank policy makers expressed uncertainty at their latest policy meeting about the economic outlook and the extent to which they’ll have to deploy monetary stimulus.
The account of their July session showed officials were reluctant to draw conclusions from early signs of economic recovery after pandemic lockdowns were eased. Chief economist Philip Lane told the gathering that the breadth and scale of the recovery remained uneven and partial.
“At its September meeting the Governing Council would be in a better position to reassess the monetary policy stance and its policy tools,” the account of the meeting showed. “This would provide more clarity regarding the medium-term inflation outlook” and prospects for economic activity.
A sharp initial rebound had some officials speculating in the run-up to the gathering that the ECB might not need to spend the full 1.35 trillion euros ($1.6 trillion) earmarked for purchases under its pandemic program. That debate was reflected in the account, with some policy makers arguing that “the net purchase envelope should be considered a ceiling rather than a target.”
Other officials countered that the “current presumption” was that the envelope of the program “would have to be used in full.”
Since then, prospects for the economy have darkened, with some indicators suggesting activity has plateaued. Lane warned earlier this month that uncertainty about the coronavirus will weigh on consumers and businesses for some time.
Infections are rising again across Europe as peak vacation season is under way. That’s forced some governments to reinstate travel warnings and tighten restrictions on mask-wearing and social contact.
At the same time, unemployment is beginning to creep up -- despite generous furlough schemes in many countries. The numbers are likely to rise further in the coming months as governments start to phase out support programs.
In the U.S., central bankers backed off in July from an earlier readiness to set a clearer bar for raising interest rates. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting published Wednesday showed officials are committed to keeping policy ultra-loose so long as the coronavirus crisis is significantly holding the economy back.
ECB officials agreed at their last gathering to wait for new forecasts in September before reassessing the outlook. Most economists predicted ahead of the July meeting that the central bank would increase pandemic purchases this year.

Between Aug. 7 and 14, the total volume of online job adverts decreased to 58% from 62% of its 2019 average, partly offsetting a large increase in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said. 
The figures used job adverts provided by Adzuna, an online job search engine, the ONS said.
Britain, like many other economies, is facing the prospect of a sharp rise in unemployment as the government phases out its emergency job subsidy scheme, which is due to close at the end of October.
The ONS said 12% of the workforce was on furlough, based on a survey it conducted between July 27 and Aug. 9, little changed from the previous two-week period.

It also said the number of people going shopping continued to rise slightly in the latest week. Overall footfall was 68% of its level the same day a year ago, the highest since the week beginning March 16, just before the lockdown fully started.

LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation jumped unexpectedly last month to its highest since March, as clothes shops did not hold their usual summer sales when they reopened after the coronavirus lockdown, but most economists expect it to fall again soon.
Annual consumer price inflation rose to 1.0% in July from 0.6% in June, the Office for National Statistics said, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
Most economists expect the rise to prove temporary -- especially as the impact of the government's ""Eat Out to Help Out"" restaurant discount kicks in during August. 
ING said ""the only way is down"". ""While ongoing supply-chain disruption will inevitably cause price spikes in certain areas, the more dominant factor will be the widely predicted rise in unemployment,"" ING economist James Smith said.
The consensus of economists polled by Reuters shows inflation remaining below the Bank of England's 2% target at least until the end of next year.
Nonetheless two-year inflation-linked bonds  priced in a higher rate of inflation at 2.675% on Wednesday, up from Tuesday's four-week low of 2.629%.
These bonds use the RPI measure of inflation, which rose to 1.6% in July from 1.1%, and this figure will also be used to calculate next year's annual increase in rail fares.
Clothing and footwear prices were the biggest contributor to the rise in inflation in July, the ONS said.
In most years retailers slash clothes prices between June and July to clear out their summer ranges in preparation for autumn.
This year, the drop in clothing and footwear prices was unusually small, perhaps reflecting discounting early in lockdown.
Higher petrol prices - and greater costs for haircuts, dentistry and physiotherapy - also contributed to higher inflation, the ONS said.
""Prices for private dental treatment, physiotherapy and haircuts have increased with the need for PPE (personal protective equipment) contributing to costs for these businesses,"" ONS Deputy National Statistician Jonathan Athow said.
Haircuts and other personal grooming cost 5.1% more than a year before.
Core inflation - which excludes typically volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices - rose to its highest in a year at 1.8% from June's 1.4%, versus expectations for a small fall.
The ONS said July's inflation number was based on near-complete coverage of its standard basket of goods and services, after widespread unavailability of some services at the start of the lockdown.
The Bank of England said earlier this month it expected inflation to turn briefly negative in the near-term, falling to -0.3% in August.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports extended their double-digit slump into a fifth month in July as the coronavirus pandemic took a heavy toll on auto shipments to the United States, dashing hopes for a trade-led recovery from the deep recession.
Meanwhile, core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business spending, unexpectedly fell to a seven-year low in June, dashing hopes domestic demand would make up for some of the slack from sluggish global growth.
The grim data suggests the depressed conditions seen in the world's third-largest economy in the second quarter showed no signs of rapid improvement in the current quarter, compounding challenges for policymakers as they look to prop up activity.
Total exports fell 19.2% in July from a year earlier, roughly in line with market expectations for a 21.0% decrease, government data showed on Wednesday.
It was, however, smaller than a 26.2% drop in June, which some analysts saw as a sign external demand may have bottomed out.
""Today's trade data confirmed that external demand hit bottom and is heading toward gradual recovery,"" said Masaki Kuwahara, senior economist at Nomura Securities.
""But the pace of recovery remains slow. Given the risk of a second wave of infections, it will take a couple of years before exports and GDP return to pre-pandemic levels,"" he said.
Shipments to the United States plunged 19.5% in the year to July as demand for engines and automobile remained weak, a sign Japan was feeling the pinch from the slow U.S. recovery from the pandemic's pain.
Globally, automakers are taking a heavy hit from the coronavirus, which has shuttered vehicle factories and kept customers out of car dealerships.
Suzuki Motor Corp (T:7269) said this month its operating profit nearly wiped out during the June quarter because of plunging car sales in India, its biggest market.
SLOW RECOVERY
In a glimmer of hope, exports to China - Japan's largest trading partner - rose 8.2% to mark the first increase in seven months on brisk demand for chip-manufacturing equipment and cars.
But those to the rest of Asia were down 8.2%, the data showed, reinforcing expectations that a full-fledged recovery in regional trade was still some time off.
Core machinery orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, fell 7.6% in June, confounding market estimates of a 2.0% gain.
Foreign orders dropped 3.9% in June from the previous month, extending declines to a fourth straight month, but slowing from double digit falls seen in April and May.
Total core orders slumped to 706.6 billion yen ($6.72 billion), the lowest since February 2013, forcing the government to downgrade its assessment to say machinery orders were ""declining.""
Manufacturers surveyed by the government expect core orders to fall 1.9% in the current quarter after dropping 12.9% in April-June, the data showed.
A decline in July-September would mark the fifth straight quarter of falls, the longest streak of decrease since orders slid for six straight quarters during the 2008 global financial crisis.
Adding to the gloom, a survey from Tokyo Shoko Research on Tuesday showed 8.5% of small firms, or more than 300,000 companies, could go out of business if the pandemic is prolonged. Such firms employ 7 out of 10 workers in Japan.
Japan's economy suffered a record annualized contraction in April-June as the pandemic crushed demand for cars and other exports and kept consumers confined at home.

Analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as a resurgence of infections will likely put a lid on demand both at home and abroad.

1688,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 19, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>",Japan Exports Drop Steeply Even as China Trade Rebounds,"(Bloomberg) --
Japanese exports continued to drop steeply in July but fell by the smallest margin in four months as a recovery in shipments to China helped cushion declines to Europe and other key markets where the coronavirus is spreading rapidly.
The value of Japan’s overseas shipments declined 19.2% from a year earlier amid continued steep falls for cars and auto parts, the finance ministry reported Wednesday. The overall slide was slightly better than economists’ projection for a 20.9% drop, but still far short of indicating a strong rebound.
A separate report showed machinery orders fell by 7.6% in June from the previous month, suggesting that a revival in capital spending could be delayed. Analysts had forecast a 2% gain in the volatile data.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",U.S. housing starts surge in July in rare pandemic bright spot,"(Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding accelerated by the most in nearly four years in July in the latest sign the housing sector is emerging as one of the few areas of strength in an economy suffering a record slowdown because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Housing starts increased 22.6% - the biggest gain since October 2016 - to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.496 million units last month, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Data for June was revised up to a 1.22 million-unit pace from the previously reported 1.186 million.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts would increase to a rate of 1.24 million units. July's data exceeded even the highest estimate of 1.32 million units.
July's construction pace was the fastest since February, the month when a record-long U.S. economic expansion abruptly ended as the coronavirus began spreading rapidly around the country, triggering business shutdowns and widespread stay-at-home orders. With last month's increase, new home building is just 4.5% below February's pace of 1.567 million units.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 Index (SPX) regained a record high in Tuesday morning trading, completing a full recovery from the stock market crash after the onset of the coronavirus crisis in February. Shares of several leading U.S. homebuilders were also at a record, including DR Horton Inc (N:DHI) and  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN). Shares of both are up around 40% this year. 
STARTS UP IN ALL REGIONS
The largest increases in homebuilding were in the Northeast, up 35% from June, and the South, up 33% from the prior month. Construction starts were up by around 6% in the Midwest and West.
Multi-family projects of five units or more surged by nearly 57% - also the largest increase since October 2016 - while single-family construction rose by just 8.2%.
On Monday, the National Association of Home Builders reported confidence among housing construction firms surged this month to match a record high. On Friday, the National Association of Realtors is expected to report sales of previously owned homes accelerated for a second month, to the fastest rate since February.
""Strong demand and a record level of homebuilder confidence will support housing starts in the second half of 2020, but the still-widespread coronavirus and an economy struggling to recover without fiscal support may limit the upside,"" Oxford Economics economists wrote in a note after the housing starts release.

Building permits issuance, considered a more forward-looking gauge of residential construction activity, also accelerated in July. Permits issuance totaled 1.495 million units at an annualized rate, up 18.8% from 1.258 million in June.

Residential starts jumped by 22.6%, the most since October 2016, to an 1.5 million annualized rate from a month earlier, according to a government report released Tuesday. That compared with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 1.25 million and followed an upwardly revised 1.22 million in June.
Applications to build, a proxy for future construction, increased 18.8% to a 1.5 million rate, topping the median estimate for 1.33 million.

""It will still be a bumpy road back to normality because for export business to normalise, many of the countries that buy the engineering products need to get a better grip on the pandemic and become more optimistic about investing again,"" VDMA chief economist Ralph Wiechers said.

Exports dropped by 14.1% in the first half of 2020 compared to a year earlier, VDMA said.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>",Indonesia posts largest trade surplus in 9 years in July,"By Gayatri Suroyo and Tabita Diela
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia posted its biggest trade surplus in nine years in July, as exports improved while domestic demand for imports remained subdued amid the coronavirus pandemic, data from the statistics bureau showed on Tuesday.
Southeast Asia's largest economy reported a $3.26 billion surplus in July, the bureau said, the biggest since August, 2011, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
The figure handily beat a forecast in a Reuters poll for a $680 million surplus and followed a $1.27 billion surplus in June.
July exports grew 14.33% from June to $13.73 billion, though were 9.90% below the value of shipments in the same month last year. Still, the pace of contraction was slower than the poll's prediction for a 16.65% drop.
By value, exports were the highest since March. Statistics bureau chief Suhariyanto attributed this to sales of agricultural products like palm oil, herbs and birds nests, and despite weaker exports of coal, rubber and oil and gas.
Imports plunged 32.55% on an annual basis to $10.47 billion, steeper than the 22.48% fall expected in the poll.
The data indicates the potential for a further narrowing of the current account deficit for the rest of the year, even after it significantly narrowed in the first half due to the pandemic.
Central bank data earlier on Tuesday showed Indonesia's current account gap in April-June was equal to 1.2% of GDP, less than half the deficit in the same period in 2019.
Bank Danamon's economist, Wisnu Wardana, said despite the trade data the central bank may need to consider a number of other indicators before utilising ""a limited room of monetary easing"", such as inflation and the rupiah's movement.

Bank Indonesia (BI) is due to wrap up a two-day policy review on Wednesday. The majority of economists in a Reuters poll, including Wardana, expects the benchmark rate to remain unchanged after four cuts to support the economy.

The drop was in line with the median forecast by 11 economists surveyed by Reuters. In June, the index had fallen 1.9%.

July's decline was driven largely by lower retail fuel prices during the month, with the transport sector index falling 10.3% on the year, the Statistics Department said in a statement.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 10:05PM ET</span>",Japan manufacturers' gloom eases slightly but pandemic woes remain,"By Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's manufacturers were their least pessimistic in four months in August, the Reuters Tankan survey of business sentiment showed on Tuesday, but signalled a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The reading highlights the immense task policymakers face to pull the economy out of its deepest recession on record after the coronavirus pandemic pummelled corporate and household activity.
The poll, which tracks the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) closely watched ""tankan"" quarterly survey, pointed to a modest recovery, with manufacturers' morale seen somewhat less negative in the coming months.
Tuesday's survey found that the mood of manufacturers rose to minus 33 in August from minus 44 the previous month, its highest since February. The service-sector gauge was at minus 23 from minus 26.
The Reuters Tankan index readings are derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents who say conditions are poor from those who say they are good. A negative reading means that pessimists outnumber optimists.
""Demand is on an improving trend compared to the first quarter but it remains at about 70% of what we had projected,"" a manager at a transport equipment maker wrote in the survey.
Data on Monday showed Japan was hit by its largest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the health crisis delivered a blow to consumption and exports.
Though the overall mood remained pessimistic, all industry categories but oil refinery/ceramics were less gloomy than in the previous month, the poll showed.
Some firms warned of uncertainty in the months ahead because of resurfacing U.S.-China trade tensions.
""Conditions in the domestic market are still bad,"" a manager at a chemicals maker wrote in the survey. ""Even if quantity (of orders) returns in Asia, prices won't match that due to intensifying competition.""
Manufacturers' sentiment was seen recovering further to minus 22 in November, while that of service-sector firms was expected to drop to minus 26, according to the poll of 495 large- and mid-sized non-financial companies, of which 232 firms responded, on condition of anonymity.

Among services, those from the information/communications and retailers sectors were positive about business conditions, while the others remained gloomy.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>","As U.S. homebuilder confidence matches record high, mortgage delinquencies rise","(Reuters) - U.S. home builder confidence rose for a third straight month in August to match its highest level ever as record-low interest rates spur buyer traffic, data released on Monday showed in the latest indication the housing market is a rare bright spot in the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. 
At the same time, however, a growing number of home owners are falling behind on their mortgages with tens of millions still out of work and growing signs that the labor market recovery is softening.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose 6 points to 78, matching a series record set in 1998. The median expectation among 30 economists in a Reuters poll was for a rise to 73 from July's reading of 72.
NAHB's measures of both current and future home sales improved. 
""Housing has clearly been a bright spot during the pandemic and the sharp rebound in builder confidence over the summer has led NAHB to upgrade its forecast for single-family starts, which are now projected to show only a slight decline for 2020,"" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ""Single-family construction is benefiting from low interest rates and a noticeable suburban shift in housing demand to suburbs, exurbs and rural markets as renters and buyers seek out more affordable, lower density markets.""
But even as home builder confidence surges, more homeowners affected by the crisis have stopped paying their mortgages, a separate report showed. 
The delinquency rate for residential mortgages rose to 8.2% in the second quarter, up nearly 4 percentage points from the first quarter and the largest quarterly increase on record, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
Loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, a program used by many first-time buyers and those with lower incomes, saw their delinquency rate jump to almost 16% - the highest since the survey began more than four decades ago. 
The figures reflect the struggles faced by millions of homeowners during the crisis, including many participating in a forbearance program that allows people facing financial struggles because of the pandemic to put off their mortgage payments for up to one year. An estimated 4.2 million homeowners had loans in forbearance as of the end of June, according to the MBA. 
That forbearance program, combined with rising home values and other loan modification options can offer relief to struggling homeowners, said Marina Walsh, vice president of industry analysis for the MBA.
There was a glimmer of positive news in the delinquency report: The 30-day delinquency rate dropped by 0.33 percentage point to 2.34% in the second quarter. 
That suggests fewer homeowners fell newly behind on payments as the unemployment rate dropped in May and June, Walsh said. ""The flood of new delinquencies is dropping off,"" Walsh said, adding that the mortgage delinquency rate tends to rise when the unemployment rate increases and vice versa. 
The U.S. Census Bureau will report July's housing starts data on Tuesday, and economists polled by Reuters are looking for an increase to 1.24 million units on an annualized basis from 1.186 million in June. 
Housing starts plunged this spring during widespread lockdown orders issued to try to contain the virus, but have rebounded sharply from a six-year low hit in April. The economy fell into recession in February as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
A separate report from the New York Federal Reserve Bank on Monday showed the pace of growth in manufacturing activity slowing much more than expected in August from a 14-month high in July.
The New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey index dropped to 3.7 from 17.2. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 15, with a reading above zero indicating expansion.

The survey's measures of new orders and shipments both pulled back after three straight months of increases.

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",UK household finances worsen in August over job worries,"LONDON (Reuters) - The financial health of British households deteriorated in August at a faster pace than last month, in an unpromising sign for the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a survey showed on Monday.
The Household Finance Index from data company IHS Markit fell to 40.8 in August from 41.5 in July, dragged down by the biggest drop in job security since 2011.
A wave of lay-offs is already underway and economists fear worse will come when the government's furlough scheme closes at the end of October.
Although economic output collapsed by a historic 20% in the second quarter of 2020, the official unemployment rate has not risen from its pre-pandemic level of 3.9% due to the furlough scheme as well as quirks in the joblessness definition.
Tax data suggests businesses have shed more than 700,000 staff since the start of the lockdown.
Earlier this month, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the central bank's projection for an unemployment rate of 7.5% at the end of this year was a ""very bad story"" for the British public, and warned that it could turn out worse than that.
""Overall, the data hint at some worrying trends when put in the context of the significant recession facing the UK,"" Lewis Cooper, an economist at IHS Markit, said.
""Incomes from employment fell sharply again, while the survey measure of job security perceptions remained firmly in negative territory as the winding down of the government's furlough scheme looms.""
Other indicators of the consumer economy like retail sales have shown a rapid rebound since the COVID-19 restrictions were loosened, although evidence from businesses has been mixed. 

The IHS Markit survey of 1,500 adults took place from Aug. 6 to Aug. 9.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 17, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",Japan's record economic plunge wipes out Abe era gains,"By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan was hit by its biggest economic slump on record in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic emptied shopping malls and crushed demand for cars and other exports, bolstering the case for bolder policy action to prevent a deeper recession.
The third straight quarter of declines knocked the size of real gross domestic product (GDP) to decade-low levels, wiping out the benefits brought by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies deployed in late 2012.
While the economy is emerging from the doldrums after lockdowns were lifted in late May, many analysts expect any rebound in the current quarter to be modest as a renewed rise in infections keep consumers' purse-strings tight.
""The big decline can be explained by the decrease in consumption and exports,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""I expect growth to turn positive in the July-September quarter. But globally, the rebound is sluggish everywhere except for China.""
The world's third-largest economy shrank an annualised 27.8% in April-June, government data showed on Monday, marking the biggest decline since comparable data became available in 1980 and slightly off a 27.2% fall forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
While the contraction was smaller than a 32.9% decrease in the United States, it was much bigger than a 17.8% fall in Japan in the first quarter of 2009, when the Lehman Brothers collapse jolted global financial markets.
The size of Japan's real GDP shrank to 485 trillion yen, the lowest since April-June 2011, when Japan was still suffering from two decades of deflation and economic stagnation.
Japanese stocks fell on Monday by the most in two weeks and yields on most government bonds fell on the weak GDP data.
Elsewhere in the region, Thailand reported its biggest economic decline since the Asian financial crisis of 1998.

CONSUMPTION PLUNGES
Underlying Japan's dismal reading was private consumption, which plunged a record 8.2% as lock-down measures to prevent the spread of the virus kept consumers at home.
External demand - or exports minus imports - shaved a record 3.0 percentage point off GDP, as overseas shipments tumbled 18.5%, with auto exports hit particularly hard.
Falling global vehicle sales have hurt automakers like Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201), among the biggest drivers of Japan's economy.
Capital expenditure declined 1.5% in the second quarter, less than a forecast 4.2% fall, as solid software investment made up for weak spending in other sectors.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura conceded the GDP readings were ""pretty severe,"" but pointed to some bright spots such as a recent pickup in consumption.
However, some analysts warn that companies could cut jobs and spending if a resurgence in infections and soft global demand continue to hurt their bottom line.
Renewed U.S.-China tensions may also weigh on the fragile recovery. About 90% of economists surveyed by Reuters expect the conflict to affect Japan's economy.
""Demand for business investment is expected to fall due to worsening corporate profits and risk of the coronavirus spreading,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research institute.
""There is a chance economic activity may stagnate if major nations adopt lockdown measures again, or Japan re-issues a state of emergency,"" he said.
Japan has deployed massive fiscal and monetary stimulus to cushion the blow from the pandemic, which hit an economy already reeling from last year's sales tax hike and the U.S.-China trade war.

While the economy has re-opened after the government lifted state of emergency measures in late May, a recent worrying rise in infections cloud the outlook.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's economy suffered its biggest annual contraction since the Asian financial crisis in the second quarter due to the fallout of the coronavirus, prompting the government to slash its GDP forecast for the year and announce more stimulus.
Data from the state planning agency showed a 100% fall in foreign tourism dealt the biggest blow to Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, while the coronavirus and measures to curb it also hit consumption, private investment and exports.
New Deputy Prime Minister Supattanapong Punmeechaow told a media conference the government would announce more stimulus this month, ""to support the economy and all groups of affected people,"" adding these would be discussed at a Aug 19 meeting.
The data, which also showed a record contraction quarter-on-quarter, represents another headache for the government, also facing its biggest anti-government protests since the 2014 coup.
""Today's economic release underscores the collapse of aggregate demand, both externally and internally,"" said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research of Kasikornbank.
""Recovery will be lengthy as the shock to the demand and supply side has been the most severe in living memory.""
Thailand's economy, which is heavily reliant on tourism and exports, shrank 12.2% in the second quarter from a year earlier after a revised 2.0% fall in the March quarter. It fell a record 9.7% on the quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Economists in a Reuters poll had forecast the economy would shrink 13.3% year-on-year and fall 11.4% quarter-on-quarter.
The National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) cut its gross domestic product forecast for the year, expecting the economy to fall 7.3%-7.8% in 2020, having previously forecast a 5%-6% slump. The economy saw a record annual contraction of 7.6% in 1998.
While Thailand has lifted most curbs after seeing no local transmission of the coronavirus for over 80 days, its economy continues to suffer from tepid global demand and an ongoing ban on foreign visitor numbers.
On Monday, the NESDC said it expected only 6.7 million foreign tourists to come to Thailand this year after last year's record 39.8 million and said there were no foreign tourists in the second quarter. 
Meanwhile, NESDC expected a 10% fall in exports in 2020, having previously forecast an 8% decline.
""A clear economic recovery will take place once there is a vaccine, which we expect in the middle of next year,"" NESDC head Thosaporn Sirisumphand told a separate press conference.
The government has already supported the economy with a 1.9 trillion baht ($61 billion) fiscal stimulus package, while the central bank has slashed interest rates by 75 basis points this year to a record low of 0.50%.

The main stock index (SETI) dropped 0.5% in early afternoon while the baht  was little changed.

1699,By Bloomberg,"<span>Aug 16, 2020 09:27PM ET</span>",Japan’s Economy Takes Record Hit With Virus Clouding Outlook,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s economy suffered a record contraction last quarter as a state of emergency and lockdowns in the country’s major export markets hammered consumer spending, production and exports. A recent uptick in infections threatens to slow the recovery.
Gross domestic product contracted an annualized 27.8% in the three months through June from the previous quarter, the Cabinet Office reported Monday, the worst for data back to 1955. Analysts had forecast a 26.9% decline. Until the pandemic, the economy’s worst single quarter was during the global financial crisis, when GDP shrank about 18%.
The figures showed a sharp drop in private consumption was the biggest drag on the economy as the virus-triggered emergency kept shoppers at home. Some factory production lines were also idled as lockdowns in the country’s major export markets contributed to the slide.
The question for policy makers and economists now is how quickly the economy can recover from the body blow and whether activity will need to be restricted again after a rise in virus cases.
