12,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 20, 2014 12:01AM ET</span>","Japan Exports Grow Strongly In October, Cutting Economic Gloom","By Reuters -
(Reuters) - Japanese exports grew in October at the fastest pace in eight months, an encouraging sign that global demand could help the country recover from recession and support the central bank's optimistic economic outlook.
The 9.6 percent annual rise in exports in October was more than double the 4.5 percent gain expected by economists in a Reuters poll and faster than September's 6.9 percent year-on-year increase.
In another sign that the world's third-largest economy is regaining its footing, a private flash survey showed that factory output grew in November at the fastest pace since March.
Policymakers were stunned by data this week that showed the Japanese economy fell into recession as a sales tax hike weighed on consumer spending and business investment. But growing exports and output could help lift some of the gloom surrounding the economy.
""The trade data shows that exports will contribute to growth in the fourth quarter and help recoup some of the weakness we've seen in Japan's domestic demand,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan StanleyStanley}} Securities.
Accelerating exports could also be a positive for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has said he will call an election amid growing doubts about his economic policies.
Japan's exports jumped in October due to higher shipments of cars, ships and electronics, finance ministry data showed.
Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japanese shipments, picked up to 10.5 percent in October from a year earlier.

Shipments to China slowed to a 7.2 percent annual rise in October from an 8.7 percent pace the previous month as the world's second-largest economy slows.
SOLID SALES TO U.S.
The expansion in exports to the United States in October doubled to 8.9 percent.
Total imports rose 2.7 percent year-on-year to October, lower than the median poll estimate for 3.4 percent.
October produced a trade deficit of 710.0 billion yen ($6.01 billion) $6.01 billion, versus the median estimate for a 1.05 trillion yen deficit.
The Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 52.1 in November from a final 52.4 in October.
However, the output component of the PMI index rose to a preliminary 53.5 from 51.3 in October, reaching an eight-month high, suggesting companies are ready to ramp up production after a dip in demand earlier this year.
""November data signaled positive growth in operating conditions for Japanese manufacturers,"" said Amy Brownbill, economist at Markit.
The Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged on Wednesday, but there are concerns its surprise expansion of monetary easing last month is still not enough to guide inflation to its 2 percent price target as growth has consistently missed expectations.

13,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 10:55PM ET</span>",China factories stall; Japanese exports enjoy rare bounce ,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factories looked to have hit an air pocket in November as a private survey showed output falling for the first time in six months, adding to concerns about slowing economic momentum and to the case for further policy easing from Beijing. 
Yet there was a rare glimpse of good news from Japan, which reported surprisingly strong growth in exports for October, a shift that should get a boost from the latest dive in the yen. 
The Japanese currency carved out a seven-year trough on the dollar on Thursday and a six-year low on the euro, and seemed set for further losses given the outlook for sustained policy stimulus from the Bank of Japan. 
In China, the flow of data was again disappointing as an early reading on HSBC/Markit's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed a drop to a six-month low of 50.0 in November, from 50.4 in October. 
A cooling property sector, erratic foreign demand and overcapacity have weighed on its manufacturers and the broader economy this year despite a steady stream of stimulus measures. 
China's annual growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, leaving 2014 on track to be slowest in 24 years. 
""We still see uncertainties in the months ahead from the property market and on the export front. We think more monetary and fiscal easing measures should be deployed."" said Hongbin Qu, chief China economist at HSBC. 
JAPAN EXPORTS JUMP 
The Markit/JMMA version of Japan's PMI was more mixed. While the headline index edged down to 52.1 in November, from 52.4 in October, output expanded at its fastest clip in eight months. 
Firms may have been responding to better offshore demand as Japan's exports rose at an annual pace of 9.6 percent in October, more than double market forecasts. 
""Exports will contribute to growth in the fourth quarter and help recoup some of the weakness we've seen in Japan's domestic demand,"" said Shuji Tonouchi senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. 
Policymakers were stunned earlier this week when data showed the economy fell into recession in the third quarter as a sales tax hike weighed on consumer spending and business investment. 
The grim news underlined the necessity of the BOJ's super-loose policy and sank the yen. The U.S. dollar surged as high as 118.26 yen  on Thursday, which should give Japanese exporters a competitive boost over time. 

Similar flash activity surveys for the euro zone and U.S. economies will be released later in the day.

17,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 02:26PM ET</span>","Fed Minutes: Economy improving, but soft inflation worries linger","Investing.com - Monetary authorities spent their most recent policy meeting agreeing that the economy was improving and no longer needed stimulus tools such as asset purchases, though concerns persisted that inflation expectations may be dipping, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's October policy meeting released Wednesday revealed.
At its October monetary policy meeting, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and said it was closing its monthly bond-buying program in a move widely expected by markets.
While the economy is improving, some monetary authorities want to be sure recovery remains sustained before raising interest rates, which is seen taking place some time in 2015, with a few voting members expressing concerns that inflationary pressures remain soft.
""Participants anticipated that inflation would be held down over the near term by the decline in energy prices and other factors, but would move toward the Committee's 2 percent goal in coming years, although a few expressed concern that inflation might persist below the Committee's objective for quite some time,"" the minutes read.
""Most viewed the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced. However, a number of participants noted that economic growth over the medium term might be slower than they currently expected if the foreign economic or financial situation deteriorated significantly.""
Markets rose on the news, with the Dow Jones erasing earlier losses, as investors interpreted the minutes as a sign the Fed is aware the economy is improving but still remains wary of raising interest rates too soon.
The Dow 30 was up 0.04% at 17,695.39, while the US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.15% at 87.50.

18,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 11:57AM ET</span>",Gradual U.S. housing recovery on track as single-family starts rise,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Starts for U.S. single-family homes rose for a second straight month in October and building permits neared a 6-1/2-year high, suggesting the housing market was still on a recovery path. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday groundbreaking for single-family homes, which account for more than two-thirds of the market, increased 4.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted 696,000-unit annual pace, the highest since last November. 
At the same time, permits for single- and multi-family housing jumped 4.8 percent to a 1.08 million-unit pace, the highest since June 2008. It also was the second straight monthly gain. 
""Housing activity continues to recover, although the pace of the recovery remains slower than in the previous couple of years, owing to the decline in housing affordability,"" said Blerina Uruci, an economist at Barclays in New York. 
A 15.4 percent plunge in starts for the volatile multi-family homes portion of the market, however, caused overall groundbreaking to fall 2.8 percent to a 1.009 million-unit pace. 
Housing remains constrained by sluggish wage growth and still-stringent lending practices, but the housing starts data bolstered views that home building would contribute to economic growth this quarter after being neutral in the third quarter. 
With the labor market gradually tightening, wages should accelerate and support further housing gains. Declining mortgage rates, which have seen the fixed 30-year rate hit a 17-month low, should also provide a boost. 
A separate report from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed applications for loans to purchase homes surged last week as low rates lured potential buyers. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as investors awaited the minutes of the Federal Reserve's Oct. 28-29 policy meeting. 
The housing market index was down 0.39 percent, with shares in D.R. Horton Inc , the largest U.S. homebuilder, largely unchanged. Last week, the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and a jump in orders. 
But shares in Lowe's Cos Inc rose more than 6 percent after the No. 2 U.S. home improvement products retailer raised its full-year profit and sales forecast. 

Last month, permits for single-family homes rose 1.4 percent, while multi-family housing permits surged 10 percent.

26,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 19, 2014 12:30AM ET</span>","BOJ Stands Firm On Rates, Outlook Despite Grim GDP","By Reuters - The Bank of Japan kept monetary settings and its upbeat economic view unchanged on Wednesday in the wake of data showing the economy has slipped into recession, preferring to spend more time to gauge the effect of its surprise easing last month.
As widely expected, the BOJ voted to continue its purchases of government bonds and risky assets, maintaining its pledge of increasing base money, or cash and deposits at the central bank, at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen ($683 billion).
""Japan's economy continues to recover moderately as a trend, although some weaknesses remain mainly in output,"" the BOJ said in a statement after its policy meeting.
It revised up its view on exports to say they were ""flat,"" compared with last month's assessment that they were weakening.
Board member Takahide Kiuchi, a skeptic of the current quantitative easing program, dissented to the policy decision in a show of his continued disapproval to last month's surprise monetary easing that was made by a closely split vote.
The meeting came in the wake of data on Monday which showed the world's third-largest economy unexpectedly slipped into recession in the third quarter, as the hit to spending from a sales tax hike in April overwhelmed the impact of massive pump-priming by the BOJ and the government.
On Tuesday, Premier Shinzo Abe said he would call an early election to seek a fresh mandate for his economic policies, and would postpone a second increase in the tax slated for 2015.
The dismal third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data likely came as a shock to many BOJ officials, who had hoped they pre-empted risks to the inflation outlook by expanding monetary stimulus last month.
Markets are focusing on what BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will say about Abe's decision to postpone the tax increase to 2017 and what the grim GDP data could mean for the policy outlook. Kuroda had urged the government to proceed with the tax hike as scheduled.
In announcing last month's stimulus increase, Kuroda stayed upbeat about the economy, saying the move was aimed at pre-empting risks of a slowdown in inflation.
But the second straight quarter of contraction will almost certainly force the BOJ to cut its forecast of a 0.5 percent economic expansion for the current fiscal year at a quarterly review of long-term projections in January, analysts say.
Any signs that Kuroda's conviction about the recovery is wavering could spur speculation of more easing early next year, they say.
""Both prices and the economy are undershooting the BOJ's forecasts. That will heighten market expectations of further easing,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.

Shinke is among a growing number of analysts who see the economy shrinking in the current fiscal year ending in March 2015, and now projects a 0.8 percent contraction.
The postponement of the tax hike compounds problems for Kuroda, who already faces a divided board and markets that are questioning his credibility.
The BOJ now gobbles up almost the same amount of government bonds that are issued each month, a move critics describe as tantamount to debt monetization.
The delay in raising the sales tax stokes worries that the BOJ's ultra-easy monetary stance is bank-rolling an alarmingly high public debt, already the highest among major economies.

30,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 18, 2014 11:30AM ET</span>","Europe Car Sales Up, Thanks To Discounting","By Angelo Young - New-auto sales in the European Union increased for the 14th consecutive month in October, led by double-digit growth in the U.K. and Spain--and despite a decline in France. New passenger car registrations, the E.U.'s gauge for measuring new car sales, increased 6.5 percent from a year earlier, to about 1.07 million vehicles, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said Tuesday.
But automakers have resorted to incentives on sales and trade-ins to fuel this growth as the 18-nation euro economy, which includes the major E.U. car markets, grew an anemic 0.6 percent in the third quarter. Regional powerhouse Germany has been showing signs of deceleration and Italy recently entered a triple dip recession. More than 24 million people in the euro zone are unemployed with a regional jobless rate of 11.5 percent in September. France, Europe’s third-largest auto market saw a 3.8 percent decline in new-vehicle registrations.
IHS Automotive analyst Carlos de Silva told Automotive News last month that sales are being supported by incentives and trade-in specials, and that cars are being purchased on the basis of “need” rather than “want” as consumers replace aging clunkers. De Silva said by email on Tuesday that October's sales data ""strengthens the idea that 2014 should end on a positive note for the region overall.""
IHS Automotive estimates E.U. new-car sales will increase by 5.5 percent this year, to 12.5 million units. That's down from a record 16 million vehicles in 2007. 

The market leader Volkswagen sold one out of every four new passenger cars and increased sales 6.9 percent on the back of a 20 percent rise in SEAT, the group’s most affordable brand. Germany’s main luxury automakers showed improvement from this time last year with Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler up 2.2 percent and BMW up 9.4 percent.
Among U.S. car companies, Ford Motor Co.’s registrations were up 4.3 percent while General Motors’ Opel/Vauxhall unit sales were up 12 percent.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 18, 2014 09:20AM ET</span>","U.S. producer inflation up, but underlying trend muted ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices unexpectedly rose in October, but the underlying trend continued to point to a benign inflation environment that could persuade the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates very low a bit longer.
The Labor Department said on Tuesday its producer price index for final demand increased 0.2 percent, driven by a jump in prices in the services sector. The PPI had declined 0.1 percent in September.
October also saw the introduction of new motor vehicle models, which could have contributed to the surprise rise in prices received by the nation's farms, factories and refineries.
Passenger car prices increased 1.0 percent last month, the largest gain in five years.
Economists had expected producer prices to slip 0.1 percent last month. In the 12 months through October, producer prices increased 1.5 percent, the smallest advance since February, after rising 1.6 percent in September.
The underlying trend in producer inflation remains tame. A broader measure, which excludes food, energy and trade services, edged up only 0.1 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in September.
This measure, which accounts for about two-thirds of final demand, was up 1.6 percent in the 12 months through October.
Slowing global growth and falling oil prices are helping to keep a lid on inflation.
Fed officials largely view the current low inflation environment as transitory and believe the likelihood of inflation running persistently below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target has diminished somewhat since early this year.
Still, muted price pressures mean the Fed will probably be in no hurry to raise its short-term interest rate from near zero, where it has been since December 2008. U.S. financial markets expect the first rate hike in mid-2015.
The dollar rose modestly against the yen and the euro, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt pared gains. U.S. stock index futures were little moved by the data.
Last month, prices for services rose 0.5 percent, the largest rise since July 2013, after slipping 0.1 percent in September. The rise largely reflected an increase in margins at wholesalers and retailers.

In October, energy prices fell 3.0 percent, declining for a fourth straight month. Food prices increased 1.0 percent, ending two straight months of declines.

38,By Investing.com,"<span>Nov 17, 2014 07:37PM ET</span>",Reserve Bank of Australia Nov minutes show concern over AUD strength,"Investing.com - The following if the full-text statement on the Reserve Bank of Australia's release Tuesday of minutes from its Nov. 4 board meeting.Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank BoardSydney - 4 November 2014Members PresentGlenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury), Heather Ridout AO, Catherine TannaOthers PresentGuy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary)International Economic ConditionsMembers began their discussion of the world economy with the observation that the growth of Australia's major trading partners had been a little below its long-run average pace in the June quarter, mainly as a result of the sharp decline in Japanese GDP. More recent data had suggested a pick-up in trading partner growth in the September quarter. Commodity prices had declined further over the past month, with oil prices recording a noticeable fall.Chinese GDP growth had been steady in the September quarter and close to the authorities' target of 7.5 per cent for 2014. Members noted that the composition of growth had continued to shift in a manner consistent with China's transition to a more balanced growth model; investment growth had eased further while consumption growth had been steady, and the service sector had continued to record slightly stronger growth than the manufacturing sector. Members observed that housing prices in China had fallen further in September and that the authorities had introduced targeted policies to ease financing conditions for home purchases and property development. Overall growth in total social financing had eased further following an earlier tightening of policies intended to put financing on a more sustainable footing.In Japan, activity looked to have increased modestly in the September quarter, following a sharp decline in output after the consumption tax increase in April, with indicators suggesting that consumption had picked up in recent months. Members judged that it was too early to assess the impact of temporary fiscal measures designed to support growth following the consumption tax increase. Overall, indicators of business conditions had improved and the labour market had continued to tighten. Output in the rest of east Asia appeared to have been growing at around its average pace of recent years, supported by stronger domestic demand.The US economy had grown at an above-trend pace in the September quarter. Business investment had picked up noticeably and the unemployment rate had declined further, although other measures of labour market slack had not improved to the same extent. After picking up earlier in 2014, inflation was about ½ percentage point below the 2 per cent goal set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Meanwhile, wage growth had increased over the past six months.The recovery in the euro area remained fragile. Despite declining a little over 2014, the unemployment rate remained high and inflation continued to be well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB) of close to, but below, 2 per cent.Commodity prices overall had declined slightly over the past month. An ongoing expansion in global supply and easing of growth in Chinese steel production had put further downward pressure on iron ore prices of late, while rising oil supplies – particularly from the United States – had led to a sharp fall in oil prices. Members observed that this would support output growth in energy-importing economies.Domestic Economic ConditionsAt the start of their review of the domestic economy and the economic outlook, members noted that the data available for the September quarter indicated that activity had grown a little below average, with the composition of growth remaining similar to that seen in the first half of 2014.Resource exports had continued to grow strongly in the September quarter and were expected to be boosted over the next year or so by a further expansion in iron ore production, despite much lower prices, and a gradual ramping up of production of liquefied natural gas. Coal production was expected to be sustained at a high level even though a few smaller, higher-cost mines had closed in response to lower coal prices. Mining investment was expected to continue to decline for some time, with current projects being completed and only a few new projects under consideration.Low interest rates and ongoing population growth were expected to continue to support growth in both housing activity and the established housing market. Growth in dwelling investment had remained strong and this was expected to continue in coming quarters, based on building approvals and other forward-looking indicators. Housing price growth had slowed from the rapid pace of late last year, but was still high in Sydney and Melbourne. While growth in housing credit for owner-occupiers was only a little above that of income, credit extended to investors had continued to grow at a noticeably faster rate.Members noted that the strength in the housing market was expected to give some support to household consumption in the near term as rising housing valuations allowed some credit-constrained home owners to bring forward their consumption. The pick-up in retail sales in the September quarter and stronger growth in retail sales in those states with more rapid housing price growth was consistent with this view. However, members also observed that expectations of low income growth would be likely to weigh somewhat on consumption, which was expected to continue growing at a moderate pace in the near term before strengthening over 2016.Survey measures of business confidence and conditions, along with measures of capacity utilisation, had been close to or above average long-run levels. However, non-mining business investment had remained subdued and liaison continued to suggest reluctance on the part of firms to undertake significant new investment projects until they experienced a sustained improvement in demand. Notwithstanding a substantial pipeline of non-residential building work yet to be done, non-residential building approvals had declined over the past year. Fiscal consolidation at all levels of government was also expected to weigh on aggregate growth in the period ahead.The forces underpinning the outlook for domestic activity were much as they had been for some time. Mining investment was expected to decline sharply and resource exports were expected to grow strongly as the transition from the investment to the production phase of the mining boom continued. Members noted that non-mining business investment was not being impeded by the price and availability of finance. Overall, the forecast for output had not materially changed. GDP growth was still expected to be below trend over 2014/15, before gradually picking up to an above-trend pace towards the end of 2016.Conditions in the labour market had remained subdued, with members noting that the latest vintage of the labour force survey data, which was released by the ABS during the meeting, showed a small rise in the unemployment rate over the previous six months and employment growth somewhat below the pace of population growth. Forward-looking indicators were at levels consistent with modest employment growth in coming months.Inflation had declined in the September quarter, after earlier strong results. The year-ended rate of consumer price inflation declined to 2.3 per cent from 3.0 per cent previously. While acknowledging that the removal of the price on carbon had been an important factor behind lower CPI inflation in the September quarter, members noted that the effect on underlying inflation, which had declined to ½ per cent in the quarter and 2½ per cent over the past year, was much smaller.Members observed that the fall recorded in tradables inflation in the September quarter had been a little surprising, given that it had been increasing in year-ended terms over the previous year, reflecting the depreciation of the exchange rate over the preceding 18 months or so. But they also noted that tradables inflation was quite volatile on a quarterly basis and that some of the most recent fall could be attributed to discounting of clothing and footwear prices to clear winter stocks built up during the period of unusually warm winter weather. Non-tradables inflation over the past year remained below its average over recent years and was little changed from the June quarter, abstracting from the effect of the repeal of the carbon price on utility prices. It was clear that lower wage growth had flowed through to the prices of many services, especially market services, while inflation in new dwelling costs had increased, consistent with the strength of activity in the housing market.The outlook for inflation had been revised up slightly in response to the depreciation of the exchange rate during October. The cumulative effect of the exchange rate depreciation since early 2013 was expected to add a little under ½ percentage point to underlying inflation in each year over the forecast period. Nevertheless, domestic inflationary pressures were generally expected to remain subdued given spare capacity in labour and product markets. As a result, underlying inflation was expected to remain consistent with the target over the forecast period.Financial MarketsMembers observed that volatility in global financial markets had increased through October, with market positioning and dynamics amplifying the effect of increased investor concern about the outlook for global growth.As expected, the US Federal Reserve ended its asset purchase program at its October meeting. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet stood at US$4.5 trillion, having increased by US$1.7 trillion during the third round of quantitative easing. Market pricing implied that the first increase in the federal funds rate would occur around October 2015, even though recent commentary by FOMC members suggested that mid 2015 was the most likely period when official rates would start to be increased. In contrast, market pricing suggested that expectations for future policy rate increases by the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had been pushed further out over the course of the past month.The Bank of Japan (BoJ) surprised financial markets late in October with its announcement of a further easing in monetary policy. Japanese equity prices in particular had risen strongly following the announcement, in which the BoJ had outlined plans to make additional asset purchases to increase the money base further, with monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds and other assets expected to be around US$60 billion. Members noted that this compared with a previous peak in monthly asset purchases by the Federal Reserve of around US$85 billion. The BoJ had stressed that the present move had been pre-emptive and sought to ensure that the previous modest rise in inflation expectations in the Japanese economy did not dissipate. At the same time, Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) announced a reduction in its target allocation for domestic bonds, together with significant increases in the corresponding target allocations to domestic and foreign equities and foreign bonds. Members noted the potential for these policy actions to increase the size of capital outflows from Japan in pursuit of more attractive yields on various assets in Australia (along with other destinations). Such flows could hold the Australian dollar at a higher level than economic fundamentals would imply.The ECB commenced its covered bond purchase program in October. Members noted that after declining over the past couple of years by around €1 trillion, the ECB's balance sheet was subsequently expected to increase to around its earlier peak, through the ECB undertaking a combination of asset purchases and targeted longer-term refinancing operations. Italian and Spanish banks remained the largest borrowers of funds from the ECB – accounting for around two-thirds of outstanding lending. Members noted that the ECB's assessment of the asset quality of the euro area banking system had been released during the month.US sovereign bond yields fell a little further over October, notwithstanding considerable variation within the month. On 15 October, yields traded over the widest intraday range (37 basis points) since 2011, as leveraged participants in this market unwound positions in other financial instruments. Australian bond yields also declined over the past month, generally tracking the moves in US Treasuries.Share prices in the advanced economies fell sharply early in October, reflecting concerns about global growth, but had generally recovered those losses by the end of the month, with share prices in both the United States and Japan reaching multi-year highs. Members noted that Japanese equity prices had risen by nearly 5 per cent on the last day of October in response to the unexpected further easing in the BoJ's monetary policy. Australian equity prices had also risen over the past month, outperforming most other markets, with stocks in the finance sector rebounding in particular.The major movement in foreign exchange markets had been the depreciation of the Japanese yen following the policy announcement by the BoJ and the announcement by GPIF. Other exchange rates had been little changed, with the notable exception of the Russian rouble, which depreciated by a further 9 per cent against the US dollar over the month to be more than 20 per cent below its recent peak in late June. While the Russian central bank had undertaken significant intervention to limit the exchange rate depreciation, its foreign currency reserves remained sizeable.After having depreciated noticeably in September, the Australian dollar was little changed against the US dollar in October. The Australian dollar had appreciated by 4 per cent against the Japanese yen, which has a 13 per cent weight in the trade-weighted basket. In trade-weighted terms, the Australian dollar ended the month higher than in January 2014, notwithstanding the significant declines in key commodity prices since then.Members concluded their discussion of financial markets with the observation that Australian lending rates on the stock of outstanding housing and business loans were continuing to edge lower, while domestic financial markets expected the Board to leave the cash rate unchanged at the November meeting.Considerations for Monetary PolicyThe outlook for the global economy had been little changed, with the growth of Australia's major trading partners forecast to be a little above average in 2014 and 2015. While members judged that the risks for the global economy were roughly balanced, they acknowledged that there was considerable uncertainty related to the outlook for the Chinese property market and the broader implications for the Chinese economy. Commodity prices had declined noticeably over the year to date, although they remained high in historical terms.Domestically, economic activity over recent months appeared to have continued growing at a moderate pace. The forces underpinning the outlook for domestic activity were much as they had been for some time and the forecasts had not materially changed; GDP growth was still expected to be below trend over 2014/15, before gradually picking up to an above-trend pace towards the end of 2016.Very low interest rates continued to support activity in the housing market and this was expected to spur activity in other areas of the economy through the usual channels. Members noted that growth in housing credit extended to investors in housing had continued to grow at a noticeably faster rate than credit to owner-occupiers.Labour market conditions had remained subdued and it was likely to be some time before unemployment declined consistently. Spare capacity in labour and product markets was likely to continue to limit domestic inflationary pressures, ensuring that the inflation outlook remained consistent with the target notwithstanding some temporary upward pressure from the depreciation of the exchange rate since early in 2013. Despite the recent depreciation of the exchange rate, the Australian dollar remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the further declines in key commodity prices over the course of the year to date. As a result, the exchange rate was offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy.In their assessment and given the information available, the Board judged that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy continued to be appropriate to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target over the period ahead. Members considered that the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.The DecisionThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2014 12:21PM ET</span>","U.S. manufacturing expands, but may be losing speed","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output rose modestly in October as motor vehicle production fell for a third straight month, suggesting some slowing in economic growth at the start of the fourth quarter. 
But growth remains relatively sturdy, with other data on Monday showing a rebound in factory activity in New York State this month. 
""While the solid outlook for the U.S. economy remains, there are, however, mounting downside risks to growth this quarter,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York. 
Factory production rose 0.2 percent last month, the Federal Reserve said. September's increase in factory output was revised down to 0.2 percent from 0.5 percent. 
Economists said based on October's manufacturing output gain, fourth-quarter gross domestic product was running at just over a 2 percent annual pace. The economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter. 
A 1.2 percent fall in motor vehicle production restrained manufacturing output last month. There were also drops in the production of nonmetallic mineral products, as well as electrical equipment, appliances and components. Motor vehicle output fell 1.9 percent in September. 
In a separate report, the New York Federal Reserve said its Empire State general business conditions index rose to 10.16 in November from a reading of 6.17 in October. A reading above zero indicates expansion. 
New orders rebounded strongly, but factory employment gauges dropped, taking some shine off the report. 
""Even with the improvement in the November survey, it still points to some moderation in manufacturing activity between the third and fourth quarters,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JP Morgan in New York. 
Businesses, however, remain upbeat about the future. An index for future business hit its highest level since January 2012 and a measure of capital expenditure posted its highest reading in more than two years. 
Despite signs of cooling in manufacturing, the U.S. economy remains a bright spot in a world of slowing or contracting growth. 
October's meager manufacturing output gain was offset by a 0.9 percent fall in mining production as oil and gas well drilling fell for the first time since February, which some economists linked to falling oil prices. 
Utilities production also fell 0.7 percent, against the backdrop of mild temperatures. Weak mining and utilities left overall industrial production down 0.1 percent in October after a 0.8 percent increase in September.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 17, 2014 03:20AM ET</span>","Japan slips into surprise recession, paves way for tax delay, snap poll","By Leika Kihara and Linda Sieg TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy unexpectedly slipped into recession in the third quarter, setting the stage for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to delay an unpopular sales tax hike and call a snap election two years before he had to go to the polls.
The recession comes nearly two years after Abe returned to power promising to revive the economy with his ""Abenomics"" mix of massive monetary stimulus, spending and reforms, and is unwelcome news for an already shaky global economy.
Gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by an annualized 1.6 percent in July-September, after plunging 7.3 percent in the second quarter following a rise in the national sales tax, which clobbered consumer spending.
The world's third-largest economy had been forecast to rebound by 2.1 percent, but consumption and exports remained weak, saddling companies with huge inventories to work off.
Abe had said he would look at the data when deciding whether to press ahead with a second increase in the sales tax to 10 percent in October next year, as part of a plan to curb Japan's huge public debt, the worst among advanced nations.
Media have said Abe could announce his decision to delay the hike for 18 months as early as Tuesday and state his intention to call an election for parliament's lower house. Ruling party lawmakers expect the poll to be held on Dec. 14.
An adviser to Abe termed the economic slide ""shocking,"" and urged the government to take steps to support the economy.
""This is absolutely not a situation in which we should be debating an increase in the consumption tax,"" Etsuro Honda, a University of Shizuoka professor and a prominent outside architect of Abe's reflationary policies, told Reuters.
Economy Minister Akira Amari said some economic stimulus was likely, but added it would be hard to craft an exceptionally big package because of the need for fiscal discipline.
No election for the lower house need be held until late 2016, but political insiders say Abe wants to lock in his mandate while his ratings are relatively robust. Next year he is expected to push ahead with unpopular policies such as restarting reactors that went off-line after the Fukushima nuclear crisis and a shift away from Japan's post-war pacifism.
Facing a divided and weak opposition, Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to keep its majority in the lower house, but it could lose some seats.
CONSUMPTION STAGNANT
A senior LDP lawmaker said he expected the premier to call a snap poll, arguing that his ""Abenomics"" strategy to reenergize the economy was working but needed more time.
""The prime minister feels strongly that he wants to make certain of the economic trend so I think he will put off the sales tax rise from next October,"" the lawmaker told Reuters.
But he added it was vital to recommit to a firm date for the rise in the levy, or risk upsetting investors worried about Japan's debt, already more than twice the size of its economy.
Even before the GDP announcement, Abe appeared to suggest he was leaning towards a tax hike delay, telling reporters that raising the tax rate would be meaningless if deflation returned.
The yen USD/JPY slipped on the poor GDP reading, with the dollar briefly pushing to a seven-year high above 117 yen. The Nikkei stock average (N225) fell 3 percent. (T)
Sluggish growth and easing price pressures due to sliding global oil prices prompted the Bank of Japan to unexpectedly expand its massive monetary stimulus last month.
Abe inherited the sales tax plan when he took power in December 2012. The LDP, its smaller ally and the then-ruling Democratic Party enacted the legislation requiring the tax to be raised unless economic conditions were judged too weak.
The GDP data showed the April hike to 8 percent from 5 percent had made it harder than anticipated for the public to shake off their deflationary mindset, Amari said, although he noted one bright spot in strong corporate profits.
On a quarterly basis, the economy shrank 0.4 percent in the third quarter after a revised 1.9 percent decrease in April-June. Economists had expected growth of 0.5 percent.
Private consumption, accounting for about 60 percent of the economy, rose 0.4 percent from the previous quarter, half as much as expected. Wage growth has not kept pace with price rises, so a key mechanism of Abenomics is not working yet.

Some economists, however, said growth could improve in the October-December quarter.

53,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 16, 2014 08:00PM ET</span>",Japanese Economy Falls Into Recession,"By Marcy Kreiter - Japan reported Monday it fell into recession in the third quarter and an increase in the sales tax was being blamed. The economy shrank 1.6 percent July through September, the Cabinet office reported.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected 2.2 percent growth while those surveyed by the Wall Street Journal had forecast 2.25 percent growth. The Daily Yomiuri said private economists had expected a 2 percent increase to be reported.
The report marked the second quarter of contraction. The economy shrank 7.3 percent in the April-to-June quarter. Japan's sales tax has increased to 8 percent April 1 from 5 percent and is scheduled to go to 10 percent next October.
“Japan is in recession -- was pushed into recession by the VAT [value added tax] hike,” Jesper Koll, head of Japan strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo, told Bloomberg Television. “Delay in the VAT hike is now a virtual certainty.”

Akira Emi, president of Ride On Express Co., Japan's biggest sushi delivery chain, urged the government to delay implementation of the second phase of the VAT increase.
“Rather than letting the Japanese economy stall by raising the sales tax again, it would be a better idea to wait for about a year until domestic demand recovers,” Emi told the Journal.
The Financial Times said Monday's report could prompt Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to call snap elections.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment for this month came in at 89.4, the highest reading since July 2007, above not only the median forecast of 87.5 among 61 economists polled by Reuters, but also the highest estimate of 89.0.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 103.0 from 98.3 and above the 98.8 forecast.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations rose to 80.6 from 79.6, beating the 80.2 forecast.
Not everything was rosy, however, as expectations for income gains remained low despite rising and came in below inflation forecasts.
""Most households still expect a declining standard of living,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent, while its five-year inflation outlook was also at 2.6 percent, the second-lowest reading in the survey's history after 2.5 percent recorded in September 2002.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 14, 2014 08:41AM ET</span>",Retail sales point to more spending zeal by U.S. consumers,"WASHINGTON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. retailers reported strong sales in October, a sign American consumers were spending with more gusto and could help keep the economy growing at a brisk pace.
U.S. retail sales rose 0.5 percent last month when stripping out volatile elements like gasoline, autos, building materials and food services, according to the Commerce Department data released on Friday.
That was the biggest increase since August and just above analyst expectations of a 0.4 percent gain.
Revised data also showed this gauge of sales, which hews closely to overall consumer spending, was unchanged in September. Data released last month had shown a decline in this core measure in September.
Retail sales account for about one-third of consumer spending, and overall they rose 0.3 percent, held back by a 1.5 percent drop in receipts at gasoline retailers. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.2 percent gain.
The drop in gasoline sales reflects falling oil prices that are generally positive for the U.S. economy because less spending on fuel will free up money to spend on other things.
Sales at clothing retailers increased 0.5 percent in October and receipts at sporting goods shops gained 1.2 percent.

Receipts at auto dealers and parts stores climbed 0.5 percent.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2014 11:53AM ET</span>","Americans are quitting their jobs more, and that's a good thing","By Jason Lange 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a paradoxically good development for the U.S. economy, Americans quit their jobs in September at the fastest rate in over six years. 
Other data on Thursday showed the number of new jobless claims rose last week but remained near a 14-year low, and the two readings suggested the U.S. labor market was moving toward full health. 
Two percent of U.S. job-holders, or about 2.8 million workers, left their jobs under their own volition in September, the Labor Department said. 
That's important for two reasons. 
One, the quits rate fell during the 2007-09 recession and has been slower to recover than other labor market indicators because workers lacked confidence to leave their jobs for greener pastures. Some analysts believe this has helped keep wage gains stagnant even as the jobless rate has fallen because employers don't have to raise wages as much to retain talent when there is less employee turnover. 
Second, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has signaled the quits rate as an indicator she is following on her ""dashboard"" for assessing progress in the labor market's recovery. 
""It's definitely good for wages,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank. ""Also, the chair of the Federal Reserve is looking at it, and if she's looking at it, we have to as well."" 
The Fed last month gave an upbeat view of the jobs market, saying that labor market slack was ""gradually diminishing."" 
Thursday's data also showed the rate of hiring, which occupies another place on Yellen's dashboard, rose in September. The job openings rate, which has already returned to the levels seen just before the recession, fell. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 12,000 to 290,000 for the week ended Nov. 8. 
That was a bigger increase than expected, but claims have now been below 300,000 for nine straight weeks, suggesting firms are well past a cycle of elevated layoffs that began in the recession. 
""This increase is nothing to worry about,"" said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""Claims can remain close to their current trend for an extended period."" 

Yields on U.S. government debt were little changed following the publication of the two Labor Department reports.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending November 8 increased by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 290,000 from the previous week’s total of 278,000.
Analysts had expected jobless claims to rise by 4,000 to 282,000 last week.

The four-week moving average was 285,000, an increase of 6,000 from the previous week’s total of 279,000. The monthly average is seen as a more accurate gauge of labor trends because it reduces volatility in the week-to-week data.

95,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 13, 2014 03:06AM ET</span>","China property investment slows further, but slump in sales shows signs of easing","By Xiaoyi Shao and Jake Spring 
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China real estate investment slowed further in the first 10 months of 2014, but property sales showed some signs of improvement, indicating Beijing's efforts to boost the ailing sector may be starting to have an effect. 
Property investment, which affects more than 40 other sectors from cement to furniture, grew at its slowest pace in over five years between January to October, rising 12.4 percent from the same period a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics(NBS) said on Thursday. 
That compared with a rise of 12.5 percent in the first nine months and was the slowest pace since July 2009. 
""Slowing property investment growth has continued to drag on China's broad economy,"" said Du Zhengzheng, an economist at China Development Bank Securities in Beijing. 
""We expect the trend will continue in coming months even though sales picked up."" 
Property sales fell 1.6 percent in October in terms of floor space, easing substantially from September's 10.3 percent drop. 
That came after Beijing announced steps in September to support the sluggish property market, including lower mortgage rates and down payments for some home buyers 
""Those are early signs that there may not be a collapse of the property market and the recent measures may have stabilized the momentum of property investment,"" said Shuang Ding, an economist at Citi in Hong Kong. 
The NBS data also showed mortgage loans to home buyers dropped 4.3 percent in the first 10 months of 2014, easing from the drop of 4.9 percent in January-September, as banks quickened their mortgage approvals and started to provide preferential rates to some home buyers. 
Still, analysts doubted whether the government moves in September would stem the weakness in the property market as a glut of unsold homes hangs over the market. Many expect real estate will remain under pressure well into 2015. 
As the sector accounts for more than 15 percent of China's annual economic output, the prolonged cooling of the housing market poses the biggest risk to the world's second-largest economy, even as Beijing tries to stimulate overall growth, economists said. 

A private survey showed home prices in China dropped for a sixth consecutive month in October, pointing to a persistent property downturn.

108,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 12, 2014 05:15AM ET</span>","UK Wages Rise More Than Expected, Unemployment Rate Stays Unchanged","By Reuters - The earnings of British workers overtook inflation in September, according to one measure of pay growth, while unemployment failed to fall for first time since the start of 2014, official data showed.
The Bank of England, which is due to give its latest assessment on Britain's economy later on Wednesday, is keeping a close eye on labor costs as it considers when to start raising interest rates.
Britain's jobless rate remained unchanged at 6.0 percent between July and September, matching its lowest level in six years, the Office for National Statistics said.
Economists had expected the rate to fall to 5.9 percent.
Unemployment has fallen sharply since the middle of last year, but earnings have so far largely failed to pick up as a surge of people seeking work has allowed employers to keep a lid on pay.
Pay has lagged inflation for most of the period since the financial crisis in 2008. But in recent months, price growth has slowed sharply while earnings have picked up a touch, narrowing the difference.
In the July-September period, total average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 1.3 percent, picking up speed from an increase of 0.9 percent in the three months to August.
Inflation in the month of September alone fell to a five-year low of 1.2 percent.
The ONS said it was the first time that regular pay had outstripped inflation by that measure since the July-September period of 2009.
Total pay, including bonuses, pay rose 1.0 percent, compared with a gain of 0.7 percent in the June-August period.
Economists taking part in a Reuters poll had expected earnings in the quarter to rise by 1.1 percent when excluding bonuses and by 0.8 percent on a total basis.
In the month of September alone average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses jumped 1.8 percent compared with the same month last year.
Including bonuses, pay edged up by 1.4 percent during the month, the ONS said.

The signs of a pick-up in pay are likely to be welcomed by Prime Minister David Cameron. Britain's opposition Labour party has put the issue of stretched living standards at the centre of its message to voters ahead of next May's national election.
The ONS said the number of people in employment rose by 112,000 to 30.793 million in the three months through September.
Employment growth has slowed since hitting a record 307,000 in the February-April period of this year.
A fall of 115,000 unemployed people in the July-September period was the smallest decline since the three months to February this year.
The number of people claiming unemployment benefit in the month of October fell by 20,400, a bit less than economists’ forecasts, compared with a revised 18,400 in September.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 09, 2014 10:42PM ET</span>","China October inflation hovers near five-year low, deflation risks seen growing","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's annual consumer inflation remained near a five-year low in October at 1.6 percent, further evidence that the world's second-largest economy is cooling and reinforcing expectations that authorities will roll out more measures to support growth.
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected annual consumer inflation to be 1.6 percent in October, the same as September, which was the weakest reading since January 2010.
On a monthly basis, consumer inflation was flat in October, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. That compared with 0.1 percent expected by economists.
""The risk of deflation has risen as the economy is expected to slow further in the next few quarters,"" ANZ economists said in a research note.
""This is a significant risk ... which requires China's policymakers to monitor the situation closely and take action swiftly,"" ANZ said, suggesting the central bank could inject money into the system more frequently to keep the financial system working smoothly.
Facing mounting risks to growth and rising risks of deflation, Beijing is widely expected to continue rolling out a steady stream of stimulus measures in coming months, though most economists believe it will hold off on more aggressive action such an interest rate cut unless conditions sharply deteriorate.
President Xi Jinping said on Sunday that the risks facing China's economy are ""not that scary"" and even if China's economy were to grow 7 percent, that would still rank it at the forefront of the world's economies.
But signs are growing that the economy is continuing to lose momentum despite a raft of earlier stimulus measures, putting the government's official 2014 growth target of 7.5 percent at increasing risk.
The producer price index fell 2.2 percent from a year ago, its 32nd consecutive decline, as sluggish demand curbed the pricing power of companies, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
The market had expected a 2.0 percent fall in producer prices after a drop of 1.8 percent in September.
Many Chinese companies are already facing rising borrowing costs as banks grow more reluctant to lend.
Yu Qiumei, a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, said worsening factory price deflation in October was mainly caused by a drop in oil prices and over-capacity problems that have plagued some sectors for years.
China has cut retail prices of gasoline and diesel seven times in a row since late July as international oil prices fell.
""The worsening PPI weighed on the manufacturing industry, providing more evidence that China's economic growth will remain under pressure in 2015. Policymakers should take more measures to boost the economy,"" said Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.
Nomura expects more forceful measures to come soon, predicting one, 50-basis-point cut in banks' reserve requirement ratio in each quarter from now into late 2015, in addition to more modest easing measures.
China's central bank pledged on Thursday to maintain modest policy support to help the economy in the near term but stressed that it will not flood markets with cash, which it fears may be funneled into speculative activities rather than the real economy.
An official survey released last week showed that the services sector grew at its slowest pace in nine months in October as the cooling property sector weighed on demand, adding to signs of fragility in the economy. A similar survey found factory activity fell to a five-month low.
Data on Saturday showed import growth slowed in October, adding to evidence of sluggish demand.

141,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 08, 2014 01:37PM ET</span>",Annual China trade growth slows in October in further sign of fragility,"By Kevin Yao BEIJING (Reuters) - Annual growth in China's exports and imports slowed in October, data showed on Saturday, reinforcing signs of fragility in the world's second-largest economy that could prompt policymakers to roll out more stimulus measures.
Exports have been the lone bright spot in the last few months, perhaps helping to offset soft domestic demand, but there are doubts about the accuracy of the official numbers amid signs of a resurgence of speculative currency flows through inflated trade receipts.
Exports rose 11.6 percent in October from a year earlier, slowing from a 15.3 percent jump in September, the General Administration of Customs said. The figure was slightly above market expectations in a Reuters poll of a 10.6 percent rise.
A decline in China's leading index on exports in October pointed to weaker export growth in the next two to three months, the administration said.
""The economy still faces relatively big downward pressure as exports face uncertainties while weak imports indicate sluggish domestic demand,"" said Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.
""The central bank may continue to ease policy in a targeted way.""
Imports rose an annual 4.6 percent in October, pulling back from a 7 percent rise in September, and were weaker than expected. That left the country with a trade surplus of $45.4 billion for the month, which was near record highs.
Annual growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter - the weakest since the height of the global financial crisis - as a cooling property sector weighs on domestic demand.
Recent purchasing managers' surveys on factory and services showed the economy lost further momentum heading into the fourth quarter as the property market weighed and export demand softened, putting Beijing's official growth target for the year at even greater risk.
SUSPICIOUS TRADE DEALS
September's surprisingly strong export growth led some analysts to question the accuracy of the official data amid signs of hot money inflows as firms tried to evade capital controls by over-invoicing precious metal sales.
The latest trade data indicated a cooldown in such speculative activity amid fears of an official crackdown.
""It's impossible to control hot money flows. Hot money may distort trade data but it won't affect the trend,"" said Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.
Customs data showed China's exports of precious metals and jewellery rose 187 percent in October from a year earlier. The pace eased from a 678 percent jump in September.
China's exports to Hong Kong, where over-invoicing is typically most pronounced, rose 24 percent in October from a year earlier, slowing from September's 34 percent increase.
Exports to the United States, China's top export destination, rose 10.9 percent in October from a year earlier, largely matching September's rise, while exports to the European Union, the second-biggest market, grew 4.1 percent, slowing sharply from a 14.9 percent jump in September.
ON TRACK TO MISS TRADE TARGET
China's external trade environment may slightly improve in 2015 but still faced uncertainties, the Ministry of Commerce said in a report published on Saturday.
""It's difficult for external demand to show a significant rebound,"" the ministry said.
China's combined exports and imports rose 3.8 percent in the first ten months from a year earlier, the administration said. That suggests China will miss its trade growth target for a third consecutive year.
The government missed its targets of 8 percent in 2013 and 10 percent in 2012 and aims for 7.5 percent growth this year.
A deluge of China data over the coming week, including factory output and investment, is likely to show a persistent cooling in the economy, reinforcing views that authorities may need to do more to fight slackening growth.
China's reform-minded leaders have refrained from acting forcefully, such as by cutting interest rates. That has caused concerns among some analysts that the modest policy measures may not be enough to prevent a sharper slowdown.
A Reuters poll published last month forecast the economy could grow an annual 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter, leaving the full-year pace at 7.4 percent - the weakest in 24 years.
China's cabinet unveiled detailed measures on Thursday to support imports of high-tech equipment, resource products and consumer goods, in its latest efforts to support the economy and rebalance trade.
That followed recent government steps to offer cheaper loans, tax breaks and currency hedging tools to exporters.
The government has unveiled a burst of ""targeted"" policy stimulus since April, including cutting reserve requirements for some banks, hastening construction of railways and public housing and allowing local governments to loosen property curbs.

China's central bank pledged on Thursday to maintain modest policy support to help the economy weather increasing headwinds in the near term but stressed that it would not flood markets with cash.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 06, 2014 07:24PM ET</span>","U.S. jobless claims, wages data point to tightening market","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week and compensation accelerated in the third quarter, in the latest signs of tightening labor market conditions.
Thursday's upbeat data underscored the resilience of the economy and some analysts said the pick-up in wage growth moved the Federal Reserve closer to start raising interest rates.
""The first precondition to higher policy rates is now being achieved,"" said Eric Green, chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Nov. 1, the Labor Department said. The four-week moving, which irons out week-to-week volatility, hit a 14-1/2 year low.
Wall Street had forecast claims dipping to 285,000. Claims have held below the 300,000 threshold for eight straight weeks.
A report on Wednesday showed private payrolls increased 230,000 in October, for a record seven straight months of job gains exceeding 200,000.
The government is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls advanced 231,000 last month after rising 248,000 in September, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The jobless rate is seen steady at a six-year low of 5.9 percent.
In a second report, the Labor Department said compensation per hour increased at a 2.3 percent rate in the third quarter after a similar rise in the prior quarter.
But with productivity advancing nearly as much, unit labor costs, a key gauge of inflation and profit pressures that measures the price of labor for any given unit of output, rose at only a 0.3 percent rate after decline at a 0.5 percent pace.
FIRMS RAISING WAGES
Hourly compensation was up 3.3 percent.
""That is a clear sign that the tightening labor market is forcing firms to pony up a little more money,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The dollar rose against a basket of currencies on the data. Its appeal was also enhanced after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi affirmed his pledge to use unconventional measures to stimulate a sluggish euro zone economy.
U.S. stocks were trading mixed, with energy shares extending their recent decline. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.
The Fed is closely watching wage growth as it ponders when to raise its benchmark interest rate, which it has kept near zero since December 2008.
The U.S. central bank ended its bond buying program last month, giving an upbeat view of the labor market by dropping its characterization of labor market slack as ""significant"" and replacing it with ""gradually diminishing.""
The increase in compensation adds to other signs of a pickup in wages. A broad wage measure, the employment cost index, recorded its biggest gain since 2008 in the third quarter. Wage growth has been the missing part in the labor market recovery.

""This is one more piece of evidence in the growing case for an early rate hike in 2015,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York

The Labor Department said on Thursday productivity grew at a 2.0 percent annual rate after expanding at an upwardly revised 2.9 percent pace in the second quarter.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast productivity, which measures hourly output per worker, advancing at a 1.5
percent rate after the second quarter's previously reported 2.3 percent expansion pace.
But the trend in productivity remains sluggish. It rose at only a 0.9 percent pace compared to the third quarter of 2013.
Over the past three years, it has never topped 1 percent on an annual basis.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor for any given unit of production, rose at a 0.3 percent rate in the third quarter,
after declining at a 0.5 percent pace.
But pay is accelerating, a good sign for the economy.
Compensation per hour increased at a 2.3 percent rate in the third quarter after a similar rise in the prior quarter.
Hourly compensation was up 3.3 percent from a year earlier, the fastest increase since the fourth quarter of 2012.
The Federal Reserve is watching wage growth as it ponders when to raise benchmark interest rates, which it has kept near
zero since December 2008. The U.S. central bank ended its bond buying program last month.

Still, the economy remains on solid footing as other data on Wednesday showed a pick-up in private sector hiring last month.
The Institute for Supply Management said its services index fell to 57.1 last month from a reading of 58.6 in September, drifting further from August's post-recession high of 59.6.
Nevertheless, the survey showed the key services sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the economy, remained solidly in growth mode. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
Another survey conducted by information services company Markit also showed services sector growth slowed last month, but stayed in expansion territory.
""The recent moderation in the surveys is broadly consistent with our view that growth cooled off between the third and fourth quarters,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
Separately, the ADP National Employment Report showed private payrolls increased by 230,000 in October, for a record seven straight months of job gains exceeding 200,000. Private hiring had risen 225,000 in September.
Job gains last month were broad-based, with mid-sized businesses adding the most workers in more than seven years.
LABOR MARKET TIGHTENING
""The labor market is tightening at a rapid pace, and it looks like we will get confirmation of that on Friday,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
The employment data helped to lift stocks. Investors were also cheered by midterm elections that put the Republican Party, considered more business friendly, in control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 2006.
The dollar was trading higher against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt fell.
The ADP figures come ahead of the Labor Department's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report on Friday, which includes both public and private sector employment.
Payrolls are expected to have increased 231,000 last month after rising 248,000 in September, according to a Reuters survey of economists. The unemployment rate is forecast steady at a six-year low of 5.9 percent.
A strengthening labor market is seen tempering some of the slowdown in growth, which is driven in part by weakening global demand, especially in China and the euro zone.
Data ranging from consumer spending to trade and business spending suggest the economy exited the third quarter with less steam, setting it up for a further moderation in the final three months of the year. Construction spending has also been weak.
Third-quarter gross domestic product was initially estimated to have expanded at a 3.5 percent annual pace, but the weak trade and construction data implied growth would be lowered to around a 3 percent rate.
Growth estimates for the fourth-quarter range between a 2.2 percent and 3.0 percent pace.
Services sector activity last month was restrained by a sharp slowing in export orders. Measures of supplier deliveries, new orders and order backlogs also fell. A gauge of services industry employment, however, hit its highest level since August 2005.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 05, 2014 10:00AM ET</span>",U.S. services sector activity growth slows in October: Markit,"NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The pace of growth in the U.S. services sector slowed more than previously estimated in October from a month earlier, hitting its lowest level in six months and pointing to a year-end slowdown in economic growth, a survey showed on Wednesday.
The final services sector Purchasing Managers Index compiled by information services company Markit slipped to 57.1 in October from 58.9 in September, hitting its lowest rate since April. Markit had initially estimated the index at 57.3 in its preliminary, or ""flash"", reading released in late October.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity.
Markit's final composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, dipped to 57.2 in October from 59.0 in September. It was initially estimated at 57.4.
Taken together with Markit's manufacturing activity survey for October, which fell to a three-month low, the data suggests the brisk U.S. economic growth rate of the previous two quarters will not be sustained in the fourth quarter, according to Markit's top economist.
""The PMI surveys warn of a slowdown as we move towards the end of the year,"" Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson said.
""The October survey data is running at a level consistent with (gross domestic product) rising at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent at the start of the fourth quarter, but any further drop in the PMI numbers raises the risk of an even sharper slowdown.""
The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department's advance reading of GDP released last week. Following a contraction of 2.9 percent in the first quarter, the economy had rebounded sharply in the ensuing two quarters, expanding at an average annual rate of 4.05 percent in that period, its fastest clip since the six months ended March 2010.

Markit's new business component slipped to 57.8 in October from 59.4 in September, hitting its lowest in three months, and the employment index also touched a three-month low.

187,By International Business Times,"<span>Nov 05, 2014 08:30AM ET</span>",UK's Rapid Economic Recovery Set For End-Of-Year Slowdown,"By Reuters - Britain's rapid economic recovery could slow markedly in the final months of 2014 after uncertainty about the global economy started to hit domestic businesses last month, a closely watched survey showed on Wednesday.
Services companies such as banks, hotels and hairdressers which make up the bulk of Britain's private sector saw growth slip to the lowest level since May 2013, according to the latest Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI).
A broader measure which also includes data released earlier this week on manufacturers and construction firms sank to its lowest since June 2013, and sterling weakened to a one-year low against the U.S. dollar in response.
While Britain still looks set to outpace other advanced economies this year, the pace of the recovery has eased over the last few months as European demand fades.
The economy now looks on track to grow around 0.5 percent in the last three months of 2014 compared with 0.7 percent in the third quarter, according to data company Markit, which compiles the PMIs.
The prediction stands at the most pessimistic end of forecasts from economists polled by Reuters, and contrasts with the Bank of England's expectation for growth of 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
Members of the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting this week will pay close attention to the survey as they gauge when to start finally raising interest rates.
""With the MPC beginning its November meeting today, these results are likely to strengthen the conviction of the doves that this is no time to think about raising interest rates,"" said Martin Beck, economic advisor to consultancy EY ITEM Club.
The UK services PMI sank to a 17-month low of 56.2 in October from 58.7 in September, weaker than even the gloomiest forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.
But the index remained above its historic average as well as the 50 threshold that marks growth, and bettered the PMIs for all other major European economies except Sweden.
Growth in Britain's services sector was tempered by a mix of worries about the euro zone, the risk of a sharp slowdown in China, uncertainty about U.S. monetary policy and geopolitical fears, according to Markit chief economist Chris Williamson.
NO PRESSURE TO HIKE
The BoE is already expected to keep interest rates at 0.5 percent after its monthly meeting ends on Thursday. Economists increasingly predict it will leave them on hold well into next year.
An absence of inflationary pressure in Wednesday's survey is likely to bolster that view.
Prices charged by services companies declined for the first time since May 2013, albeit only modestly, while growth of input prices eased.
Three of the BoE's most senior officials have signaled they are comfortable with record-low rates over the last few weeks. Minutes from the Bank's October policy meeting showed most officials were worried about the weak euro zone economy.

Markit's composite PMI, a broader gauge of the economy that combines services, manufacturing and construction industries, fell to 56.4 from 58.1 -- its lowest level since June 2013.
""The surveys therefore suggest that the Bank of England will wait to gauge the full extent of the slowdown before making any decisions on policy,"" said Markit's Williamson.
Earlier this week, PMIs showed Britain's construction sector expanded at the weakest rate in five months in October, while British manufacturing surged unexpectedly last month.

Speaking to a seminar, he said the BoJ board's projection in its latest semi-annual Outlook Report released Friday has been revised down slightly, CPI inflation is still projected as likely to reach ""around 2% in or around fiscal 2015.
""There is no central bank in the world that can achieve 2% inflation in exactly 2 years,"" Kuroda said.
""Having said that, if a central bank says it will achieve 2% eventually without mentioning a timeframe, that would not prompt firms and households, which have been mired in a deflationary mindset, to take actions from now on based on the assumption of 2% inflation.""
""This is why the bank adheres to its timing for achieving 2% inflation. At the same time, this is also the reason why the bank puts emphasis on maintaining the momentum of expectation formation in its latest action.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly widened in September as exports hit a five-month low, a sign that slowing global demand could undercut economic growth in the fourth quarter. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade gap increased 7.6 percent to $43.03 billion, ending four straight months in which the deficit had narrowed. 
""We expect a stronger dollar and weaker growth abroad, most notably in Europe, will take a greater toll on the trade balance and overall growth in the economy,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. 
September's shortfall was bigger than the $38.1 billion gap the government had assumed in is estimate of third-quarter GDP last week, when it said the economy expanded at a 3.5 percent annual rate, with trade adding 1.3 percentage points. 
Economists, who had expected a $40.00 billion trade gap in September, said the wider deficit could cut as much as a half a percentage point off that growth estimate. That would come on top of a reduction of about two-tenths of a point due to weak construction spending data released on Monday, they said. 
The government will publish revisions to third-quarter GDP later this month. 
In another report, the Commerce Department said orders for factory goods fell for a second straight month in September. Relatively firm domestic demand, however, is expected to keep U.S. factories humming. 
While the trade data had little impact on U.S. financial markets, concerns about weakening global demand pushed Brent crude oil prices to the lowest level in more than four years, dragging down U.S. stocks. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose. 
STRONG DOLLAR 
Exports in September fell 1.5 percent to $195.59 billion, the lowest level since April, a sign that weakening demand in key markets such as China and the euro zone was starting to weigh. 
A survey of U.S. manufacturers published on Monday showed a decline in a gauge of export order growth, suggesting exports will weaken further. 
Apart from slowing global demand, exports are seen crimped by a strong dollar, which so far this year has strengthened by about 4 percent against the currencies of the country's main trading partners. 
""We expect that the trade sector actually will subtract slightly from growth in the coming year,"" said Peter D'Antonio an economist at Citigroup in New York. 
The decline in exports in September was broad-based, with the exception of food and beverages, which rose. 
Exports to the European Union fell 6.5 percent, while those to China slipped 3.2 percent. Exports to Japan tumbled 14.7 percent. There were also declines in exports to Mexico and Brazil. 
Overall imports were unchanged in September as petroleum imports hit their lowest level since November 2009. 
A domestic energy boom has enabled the United States to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, tempering the trade deficit. Declining prices, which hit a seven-month low in September, are also helping to curb the import bill. 
Consumer goods imports, however, were the highest on record in September, as were non-petroleum imports. Cellphones, most likely Apple's (O:AAPL) new iPhone 6 model introduced in September, accounted for the bulk of the consumer goods imports. 
Imports from China hit an all-time high, leaving the politically sensitive trade gap at $35.6 billion, the highest on record. Imports from Canada were the highest since July 2008.

The uptick in negative trade balance will pull down the government’s initial estimate for third-quarter gross domestic product from an annualized 3.5 percent to about 3 percent.
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that the trade deficit rose 7.6 percent, to $43 billion, in September. The consensus forecast assumed the deficit would remain much unchanged at $40.2 billion, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which estimates GDP, assumed the deficit would narrow to $38.1 billion with rising exports and falling imports.
But an economic slowdown in China and across Europe has weakened demand for American-made goods. Exports shrank by 1.5 percent in September from August, on lower orders for industrial supplies, capital goods and consumer goods. Imports didn’t change much.

“Looks like the global industrial slowdown is showing up,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist, in a note Tuesday.
Economists expect the trade deficit to narrow again before the end of the year because oil prices are declining. Ashworth expects the lower cost of imported oil to push the trade deficit “well below” $40 billion per month again.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 04, 2014 06:10AM ET</span>",Weaker orders at Canton Fair signal China export boost may not be sustainable,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's bellwether import-export trade fair showed a decline in orders year-on-year, indicating that strong external demand which helped buoy growth in the third quarter may not be sustainable in the final three months of the year.
The China Import and Export Fair, popularly known as the Canton Fair, generated 179.2 billion yuan ($29.30 billion), organizers said in a statement on Tuesday, the final day of the event that began on Oct. 15. That's 8.6 percent less than last fall's fair after accounting for currency fluctuations.
The twice-yearly event is China's biggest trade exhibition and is seen as a forward indicator of demand for the country's exports.
The importance of the fair has declined as the world's second-largest economy seeks to shift away from exports and manufacturing toward consumption and services to find new drivers of growth.
Despite the desire to pivot away from trade, analysts said strong export growth contributed significantly to China's 7.3 percent growth in the third quarter from a year earlier, beating expectations of 7.2 percent.
September exports increased 15.3 percent year on year, far higher than predictions of 11.8 percent growth.
Attendance at the fair declined by a slim 1.9 percent from the same period a year earlier with worries over the Ebola virus epidemic potentially leading some to stay home. State-run China Daily quoted the fair's spokesman in mid-October saying Ebola and domestic dengue fever epidemics would likely affect attendance and that Africans would not be barred from the event.
Medical workers at the fair held in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong province, donned full protection suits and checked visitors for signs of the Ebola virus that has killed nearly 5,000 people, mostly in West Africa.

The majority of buyers came from Asia, with roughly 20 percent coming from Europe and 14 percent from the Americas. African buyers made up only 8 percent of attendees.

For a full text statement of the decision, see below:Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy DecisionAt its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.Growth in the global economy is continuing at a moderate pace. China's growth has generally been in line with policymakers' objectives, though weakening property markets there present a challenge in the near term. Commodity prices in historical terms remain high, but some of those important to Australia have declined further in recent months.Volatility in some financial markets has picked up over the past couple of months. Overall, however, financial conditions remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and risk spreads remain very low. Markets still appear to be attaching a low probability to any rise in global interest rates or other adverse event over the period ahead.In Australia, most data are consistent with moderate growth in the economy. Resources sector investment spending is starting to decline significantly, while some other areas of private demand are seeing expansion, at varying rates. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued. Overall, the Bank still expects growth to be a little below trend for the next several quarters.Recent data on prices confirmed that inflation is running between 2 and 3 per cent, as expected, and this is likely to continue. Although some forward indicators of employment have been firming this year, the labour market has a degree of spare capacity and it will probably be some time yet before unemployment declines consistently. Hence, growth in wages is expected to remain relatively modest over the period ahead, which should keep inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate.Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and have continued to edge lower over the past year or so as competition to lend has increased. Investors continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth is moderate overall, but with a further pick-up in recent months in lending to investors in housing assets. Dwelling prices have continued to rise.The exchange rate has traded at lower levels recently, in large part reflecting the strengthening US dollar. But the Australian dollar remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the further declines in key commodity prices in recent months. It is offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy.Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand and help growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

Construction spending dropped 0.4 percent to an annual rate of $950.9 billion, the Commerce Department said on Monday. August's construction outlays were revised to show a 0.5 percent fall instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent decline.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.7 percent. The government last week reported that the economy grew at a
3.5 percent annual pace. Growth in spending on both residential and nonresidential construction were reported to have slowed from April-June's brisk rates.
In September, private construction spending dipped 0.1 percent to its lowest level since October last year as an increase in residential outlays was offset by a decline in spending on nonresidential projects. It was the fourth straight month of declines in private constructions spending.

Spending on public construction projects fell 1.3 percent in September, with state and local government investment declining 1.4 percent. Spending on construction projects by the federal government slipped 0.3 percent, falling for a third consecutive month.

Financial data firm Markit said its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index fell to 55.9 from September's final reading of 57.5. The reading showed an even sharper slowdown than initially estimated in Markit's preliminary or ""flash"" PMI reading of 56.2 on Oct 23 and was the index's largest decline since February.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity.
The new orders subindex was unchanged from the flash reading, dropping to 57.1, its lowest level since January, from a final reading of 59.8 in September.
Output, meanwhile, fell more than earlier estimated, sliding to 57.8, the lowest since March, from 59.6 in September. Output had initially been estimated at 58 in the flash reading.
""The latest figures indicate that the recovery has lost some intensity at the start of the fourth quarter, reflecting subdued export demand from the euro area and key emerging markets,"" said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit.
""Meanwhile, a solid rate of manufacturing job creation was sustained in October, which provides an early indication that domestic labor market conditions have continued to strengthen through the final quarter of the year,"" Moore said.

Markit's Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a fifth of the economy, climbed to 51.4 from 49.9 in September, bouncing back above the 50 mark that denotes growth. The final figure was slightly below the flash reading of 51.8.
Output growth accelerated in October and firms added the most staff in nearly three years. But the survey also showed new business falling for a second month, albeit very slightly, as Russian sanctions and a general economic slowdown weighed on demand, Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said.
""Worryingly, the drop in new work was driven by weakening domestic demand."" ""Overall, the data send mixed signals about the health of Germany's manufacturing sector and it is too early to say whether the sector will be able to sustain growth in the fourth quarter,"" he added.
New export contracts rose very slightly. Input prices fell at their sharpest rate in six months, driven down by lower crude oil and raw material costs, while output prices increased only marginally, suggesting inflationary pressures are limited.

The German economy had a strong start to 2014 but contracted in the second quarter. Fears about a recession are rife, partly due to euro zone weakness and a depressed investment climate caused by political crises abroad. Third-quarter gross domestic product figures are due out on Nov. 14.

236,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2014 02:05AM ET</span>","China Oct PMIs point to cooling economic momentum, growth target at risk","By Kevin Yao and Xiaoyi Shao BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economy lost further momentum heading into the fourth quarter as a cooling property market weighed on activity and export demand softened, surveys showed on Monday, putting Beijing's official target for the year at even greater risk.
Analysts had already expected full-year growth to miss the goal of around 7.5 percent, but many thought there may be some signs of stabilization in the world's second-largest economy late in the year after a flurry of stimulus measures.
Instead, the surveys showed demand at home and abroad continued to cool and the labor market remained under stress, while adding to fears that many companies are being starved of credit as banks grow more reluctant to lend.
And measures announced in late September to shore up the slumping housing market so far seem to be having little effect, reinforcing expectations that Beijing will have to stump up more support.
""Growth momentum is slowing going into the fourth quarter,"" said Kevin Lai, senior economist at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong.
""Exports were quite strong the last couple of months but that was mostly driven by electronics demand. So the orders for iPhones etc. have cooled down again. Europe and Japan are still struggling, so that is not good news.""
Growth in China's services sector slipped to a nine-month low of 53.8 in October, the weakest reading since January, from September's 54.0, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
It was still comfortably above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction, but readings on areas such as real estate and employment continued to shrink.
Home prices in China dropped for a sixth consecutive month in October, a separate private survey showed on Friday, pointing to a persistent downturn, despite government efforts to lift the market.
Beijing is counting on strong job growth in the services sector to offset that weakness, and top policymakers have insisted that the labor market remains resilient.
FACTORY GROWTH ALSO FRAGILE
Another official survey on Saturday showed factory activity unexpectedly fell to a five-month low in October as firms fought slowing orders and rising borrowing costs.
A private factory survey by HSBC/Markit on Monday showed a similar worrying trend. Though overall growth picked up slightly, growth in new orders and new export orders - proxies for domestic and foreign demand - fell to their lowest in four to five months.
Exports have been one of the lone bright spots for the economy, and helped offset weaker internal demand in the third quarter.
Tommy Xie, an economist at OCBC Bank, estimated that without firmer exports, the economy would only grow an annual 6.7 percent in the first three quarters this year - the slowest since the 1998 Asian crisis.
The official PMI is focused on larger, state-owned factories, as opposed to the HSBC/Markit PMI which focuses more on smaller manufacturers in the private sector.
MORE SUPPORT MEASURES
Most analysts believe authorities will announce further modest support measures in coming months to support growth, but they are divided over whether policymakers will act more aggressively, such as by cutting interest rates, unless there is a risk of a sharper slowdown.
Barclays expects a bolder policy response soon.
""We maintain our forecast for two, 25-basis-point cuts in benchmark interest rates, one in Q4 14 and one in Q1 15,"" the bank's economists said in a research note.
""Weakening October official PMI, soft domestic demand and rising disinflationary risks are adding to the probability of more monetary easing. We also note that the PMI shows that the targeted easing measures are not effective in supporting small- to medium-size enterprises.""
China's annual economic growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis, even as the government rolled out more stimulus measures.
A Reuters poll published last month forecast the economy could grow at an annual 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter, leaving the full-year pace at 7.4 percent - the weakest in 24 years.
But Daiwa's Lai was more bearish, expecting fourth-quarter growth to slow to 6.9 percent, dragging full-year growth to 7.2 percent.
FUNDING COSTS RISING
The government has vowed to maintain policy measures which are targeted at the most vulnerable sectors of the economy.
So far this year, it has accelerated construction of railway and public housing projects, cut reserve requirements (RRR) for some banks and, perhaps most significantly, loosened lending rules to support the housing market.
As would be expected, the official factor survey on Saturday showed big Chinese factories were weathering the downturn better than their smaller counterparts, as banks prefer to lend to larger state-owned firms, assuming the government will bail them out to prevent any defaults.
But Chinese companies in general are facing higher borrowing costs as banks grow more cautious about the cooling economy.
Funding costs rose 13.5 percent in the first nine months of this year compared with a year ago, the government survey showed, adding to the burden on factories which are already battling shrinking profit margins.
China's biggest banks last week reported rising bad loans for the third quarter, and one said the credit crunch which is squeezing small companies in the country's export-oriented eastern provinces may be spreading westwards.

""The possibility that risks will gradually spread from small enterprises to large and medium enterprises ... and from eastern region and coastal areas of China to central and western regions will be intensified,"" the country's fifth-largest listed lender Bank of Communications Co Ltd (SS:601328) (HK:3328) said.

238,By Reuters,"<span>Nov 03, 2014 12:20AM ET</span>","China October services growth slips to nine-month low, property weighs","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's services sector grew at its slowest pace in nine months in October as a cooling property sector weighed on demand, a survey showed on Monday, adding to signs of fragility in the world's second-largest economy.
The services sector has been more resilient than the manufacturing sector and is creating more jobs, which partly explains why the government has so far refrained from more aggressive policy easing in supporting the slowing economy.
The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.8 in October from September's 54.0, which was the weakest reading since January, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
But it was still comfortably above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
The sub-index of new orders inched up to 51.0 in October from September's 49.5, which was the lowest since December 2008.
""Sub-indices for sectors such as railway transport and real estate remained below the 50 point and market demand weakened,"" the bureau said.
The sub-index measuring employment fell to 48.9 in October - the fourth straight month when it was below 50, and was down from September's 49.5.
An official survey published on Saturday showed China's factory activity unexpectedly fell to a five-month low in October as firms fought slowing orders and rising costs in the cooling economy, reinforcing views that the country's growth outlook is hazy at best.
China's annual economic growth slowed to 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace since the global financial crisis, even as the government rolled out more stimulus measures to avert a sharper slowdown.
The two surveys suggest a further loss of economic momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Analysts had already expected full-year economic growth to miss the government's full-year target of around 7.5 percent, even after it rolled out a series of support measures.
Still, top policymakers have issued a steady stream of reassurances about the economy in recent weeks, citing among other things a strong services sector and a still resilient labor market.
Policy measures so far this year include accelerated construction of railway and public housing projects, cuts in reserve requirements (RRR) for some banks and loosening of restrictions on property purchases to support the cooling housing market.

The services sector made up 46.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, surpassing the secondary sector – manufacturing and construction – for the first time, as the government aims to create more jobs and boost domestic consumption.

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) eased to 50.8 in October from September's 51.1, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Saturday, but above the 50-point level that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 51.2.
Growth in new orders cooled in October, as the index retreated to 51.6 from 52.2. New export orders were 49.9 in October, pointing to a contraction, from 50.2 in September.
""The fall in the index also reflects the downward pressure on the economy,"" said Chen Zhongtao, an official at the China Logistics Information Centre, which helps publishes the PMI.
""There is a need to carry out more quickly the policy measures related to 'stabilizing growth'"", Chen said, referring to recent government announcements aimed at supporting the economy.
The Chinese economy has had a tough year, with growth falling to its lowest level since the 2008/09 global financial crisis between July and September, due to a sagging housing market and cooling domestic demand and investment.
The PMI data followed warnings by China's industrial ministry on Friday that factories were under pressure from high borrowing costs, which were further exacerbating the sector's slowdown.
The report also showed that big factories were weathering the slowdown better than their smaller peers.
Large manufacturers grew last month with their PMI little changed at 51.9, while business shrank for small- to medium-sized factories.
The PMI for mid-sized factories fell to 49.1 in October from September's 50, and the index for small manufacturers was little changed at 48.5.
To support its economy, China has cut taxes, quickened some investment projects, lent short-term loans to banks, instructed local governments to spend their budgets and reduced the amount of deposits that some banks hold as reserves to spur lending.

But the raft of measures - which were issued over a space of a few months - have failed to sustain momentum in the economy, prompting authorities to take one of their most drastic policy actions this year by cutting mortgage rates in September.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final October reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment finished at 86.9, the highest level since July 2007, up from 84.6 at the end of September. 
The late October reading was up slightly from its initial figure of 86.4, which was also the expected reading of economists polled by Reuters. 
""The gains in confidence over the past three months point toward improved holiday spending by consumers,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement. 
""Overall, five years after the start of the recovery, consumers have finally begun to adopt the expectations and behaviors that have driven past expansions."" 
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions dipped to 98.3 from the 98.9 in September and was below the forecast of 98.9. 
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations rose to 79.6 from the preliminary 78.4 reading and the 75.4 at the end of September, topping the expected 78.2. 

The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 2.9 from the 3 percent view in September, but ticked up from the 2.8 percent expectation in the preliminary reading. The survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook held steady at 2.8 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell for the first time in eight months in September, suggesting the economy lost some momentum heading into the fourth quarter. 
The slowdown in consumer spending, however, is likely to be temporary, as other data on Friday showed wages in the third quarter recorded their largest increase in more than six years. 
Consumer spending declined 0.2 percent last month after a 0.5 percent increase in August, as demand for goods tumbled and demand for services barely rose, Commerce Department data showed. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, to increase 0.1 percent in September. 
""We expect lower energy prices to be a positive for consumers and look for a pickup in spending growth in the fourth quarter,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending fell 0.2 percent. That was the first drop since April and followed a 0.5 percent rise in August. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, increased 0.7 percent after advancing by the same margin in the second quarter. 
Wages and salaries, which account for 70 percent of employment costs, rose 0.8 percent in the third quarter, the largest increase since the second quarter of 2008. They had gained 0.6 percent in the second quarter. 
Various business surveys have been hinting at an acceleration in wage growth. The third-quarter increase in wages and salaries is a welcome sign for the labor market. 
Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday gave a fairly upbeat assessment of the labor market, dropping their characterization of labor market slack as ""significant"" and replacing it with ""gradually diminishing."" 
SPENDING SEEN REBOUNDING 
U.S. Treasury debt prices on Friday extended losses on the mixed data, while the dollar hit its highest level since June 2010 against a basket of currencies. U.S. stock index futures were trading higher. 
The consumer spending data was included in Thursday's gross domestic product report, which showed the economy expanded at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter after growing at a 4.6 percent pace in the second quarter. 
The softer consumer spending at the end of the third quarter could add to expectations of slower growth in the final three months of the year. A report on Tuesday showed unexpected weakness in business spending plans for equipment in September. 
But with gasoline prices at a near four-year low and improving wage growth, consumer spending is likely to rebound in the months ahead. 
Income rose 0.2 percent in September after increasing 0.3 percent in the prior month. With income growth outpacing consumption, savings jumped to $732.2 billion, the highest level since December 2012, from $702 billion in August. 
That lifted the saving rate to 5.6 percent from 5.4 percent in August. 
Weak consumption kept a lid on inflation last month. A price index for consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after slipping 0.1 percent in August. In the 12 months through September, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 1.4 percent for a second straight month. 
Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.1 percent for a third consecutive month. The so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through September. 

Both price measures continue to run below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent inflation target.

282,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 30, 2014 08:40AM ET</span>","U.S. jobless claims rise, but underlying labor market trends firming ","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose for a second straight week last week, but remained at levels consistent with a firming labor market.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 287,000 for the week ended Oct. 25, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 250 to 281,000. Claims at these levels indicate a strengthening in labor market conditions.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the state level data.
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday offered a rather upbeat view of the labor market, dropping its characterization of labor market slack as ""significant."" Fed officials now view the underutilization of labor resources as ""gradually diminishing.""
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 29,000 to 2.38 million in the week ended Oct. 18.
The so-called continuing claims data covered the period for the household survey from which the unemployment rate for October will be calculated.

Continuing claims fell 58,000 between the September and October survey periods, suggesting a decline in the jobless rate. The unemployment rate fell below 6 percent in September for the first time since July 2008.

""Statement issued by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler: The Reserve Bank today left the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 3.5 percent.
The global economy is growing at a moderate rate although recent data suggests some softening in the major economies, apart from the United States. Monetary policy is expected to remain supportive for longer in all the major economies. Growth in the New Zealand economy has been faster than trend over 2014, reducing unemployment and adding to demands on productive capacity. Strong construction sector activity, high net immigration, and interest rates, which remain low by historic standards, continue to support the expansion.
Output growth is expected to moderate over coming years, towards a more sustainable rate. Lower commodity prices and increased global financial market volatility have taken some pressure off the New Zealand dollar. However, its current level remains unjustified and unsustainable and continues to constrain growth in the tradables sector. We expect a further significant depreciation. CPI inflation remains modest, and was 1 percent in the year to September. Contributing factors are subdued wage inflation, well-anchored inflation expectations, weak global inflation, falls in oil prices, and the high New Zealand dollar. House price inflation has fallen significantly since late-2013, in part due to interest rate increases and the LVR restrictions.
The economy appears to be adjusting to the policy measures undertaken by the Bank over the past year. CPI inflation is currently at a low level despite above-trend growth. However, inflation is expected to increase as the expansion continues. A period of assessment remains appropriate before considering further policy adjustment.""

298,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 29, 2014 02:08PM ET</span>","Fed closes monthly bond-buying program, leaves rates unchanged","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and said it was closing its monthly bond-buying program in a move widely expected by markets.
Prior to Wednesday, the Fed had been purchasing $15 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur recovery by suppressing interest rates, though improvements taking place in the labor market prompted the U.S. central bank to end the stimulus program.
The program began in 2012 at $85 billion a month, while a gradual tapering brought it down to October's closure.
""The Committee judges that there has been a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the inception of its current asset purchase program. Moreover, the Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability,"" the Fed said in its statement on monetary policy.
""Accordingly, the Committee decided to conclude its asset purchase program this month.""
Despite hit-or-miss economic indicators, the U.S. economy continues to recover.
While inflationary pressures remain at bay, consumer prices should soon approach the Fed's 2% comfort zone.
Still, the Fed won't rush to hike interest rates until monetary authorities are convinced the economy is firmly standing on its own two feet, though the Fed will act if it sees inflationary pressures mounting.
""The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program this month, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored,"" the statement read.
""However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated. Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.""
In the past, the Fed has hinted that rates may begin to rise when the unemployment rate reached 6.5%.
Today, an improving labor market has brought that rate down to 5.9%, though slackness still persists in the labor market in the form of many working part-time jobs and others remaining out of the workforce for too long.
Other rears persist that cooling European and Chinese economies may drag on U.S. recovery, and the Fed stressed in its statement that it will analyze a broad spectrum of data and not just a few indicators when deciding to raise interest rates, often referred to as removing policy accommodation.
""When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent,"" the Fed said.
""The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.""
The US dollar index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.65% at 86.02.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 28, 2014 01:16PM ET</span>","Capital spending softens, but consumer confidence rises","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Demand for U.S.-made capital goods recorded its biggest drop in eight months in September, a cautionary note for an economy that otherwise seems to be moving forward at a steady clip. 
A moderation in home price gains in August, also reported on Tuesday, offered a further suggestion the economy may have cooled a bit, although consumer confidence jumped to a seven-year high this month. 
""The weak capital goods orders and house price data confirm the slowdown in activity, but the burst in consumer confidence suggests that U.S. households are very optimistic about the outlook,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, fell 1.7 percent last month, the Commerce Department said. It was the largest drop in so-called core capital goods demand since January, and it surprised economists who had expected a 0.6 percent gain. 
Some analysts blamed the weakness on slowing growth in China and the euro zone, but they said there was no reason for alarm, noting that an array of other manufacturing indicators have remained relatively strong. 
""You have to look at the comprehensive evidence we have seen regarding manufacturing, and it tells you the manufacturing sector is doing fine,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. 
A second report showed the S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of home prices in 20 metropolitan areas gained 5.6 percent in August from a year earlier. It was the slowest year-on-year increase since November 2012, and just the latest sign the housing sector continues to muddle along. 
Separately, the Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes increased to 94.5 this month, the highest reading since October 2007, from 89.0 in September. The jump came despite a sharp stock market sell-off, with households cheered by a steadily firming labor market and falling gasoline prices. 
The strong confidence reading and healthy corporate earnings boosted U.S. stocks. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were trading lower, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. 
SHIPMENTS FALL 
The mixed data was unlikely to have much of an impact on U.S. monetary policy, with Federal Reserve officials expected to show little sign of being in a hurry to start raising interest rates when they end a two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. 
With core capital good orders declining, overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - fell for a second straight month. 
Orders have been volatile recently because of big swings in aircraft demand. Aircraft orders dropped 16.1 percent in September, which came as a surprise as Boeing (N:BA) had recently reported 122 new orders, up from 107 in August. 
Core capital goods shipments, which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement, slipped 0.2 percent in September. 
While the weakness in shipments suggested a slightly less robust pace of business spending in the third quarter, economists said they still thought business investment would provide a sizable contribution to third quarter economic growth. 

The government's advance GDP estimate on Thursday is expected to show the economy expanded at a 3 percent annual pace in the third quarter, according to a Reuters survey of economists, after the second quarter's robust 4.6 percent rate.

The 2.3 percent annual rise blew past a 0.6 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll and marked the biggest gain since March. It followed a 1.2 percent rise in August.
Consumer spending has disappointed since the government raised the sales tax once in April, so evidence that a durable turnaround is imminent could make it easier for Tokyo to go ahead with a second hike in the tax to boost revenue for welfare spending.
Rebounding consumer spending is also a welcome sign for the Bank of Japan, as it tries to guide inflation to 2 percent some time next fiscal year to eliminate the risk of Japan falling back into deflation.
""The recovery in consumer spending is gaining pace because demand is improving,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
""Things are finally improving. Consumer spending will make a positive contribution to third-quarter gross domestic product.""
Retail sales accelerated due to gains in apparel, food and beverage sales, data released by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry showed on Tuesday.
An adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been arguing that the government should delay a second increase in the sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent scheduled for October 2015 as the economy is not strong enough.
The government has already raised the nationwide sales tax to 8 percent from 5 percent on April, as part of a two-stage plan to ease pressure on the national budget.
Abe has to decide by year-end whether to proceed with the second tax hike to curb Japan's mammoth debt burden, which at more than twice the size of its economy is the worst in the developed world.
A recent run of weak data on factory output and exports prompted the government to cut its economic assessment for two consecutive months, raising speculation that it may roll out more stimulus spending or push back the second tax increase.

People familiar with its deliberations said the BOJ is preparing to roughly halve its 1 percent economic growth forecast for this fiscal year at a meeting on Oct. 31 but stand pat on policy and its prediction that inflation will hit its 2 percent target in the year from next April.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity dipped to a six-month low in October, while manufacturing output in Texas dipped, pointing to some moderation in economic growth early in the fourth quarter. 
Other data on Monday showed contracts to buy previously owned homes rebounded less than expected in September, an indication that the housing recovery remains gradual. 
Analysts were little worried by the data and said the economy was fundamentally solid even with some anticipated cooling of growth in the fourth quarter. 
""Home sales are probably not going to do much but business activity in general is still pointing to a solid underpinning for the U.S. economy,"" said Jacob Oubina, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. 
Financial data firm Markit said its preliminary or 'flash' services sector purchasing managers index slipped to 57.3 last month, the lowest reading since April, from 58.9 in September. A reading above 50 signals expansion in the vast services sector. 
The index, which was dragged down by a fall in a new business sub-index, has declined for four straight months. 
""The October readings indicate that the pace of economic growth looks set to moderate in the fourth quarter, down to perhaps 2.5 percent,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London. 
The government is expected to report on Thursday that the U.S. economy expanded at a 3.0 percent annual pace in the third quarter, according to a Reuters survey of economists. 
Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said its production index, which measures the state of manufacturing conditions in Texas, fell to 13.7 this month from 17.6 in September. The new orders sub-index, however, doubled and hit a six-month high. Companies were also upbeat about the future. 
HOUSING LACKLUSTER 
In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed in September, rose 0.3 percent after falling 1.0 percent in August. 
These contracts usually translate into sales after a month or two. The gain last month was below Wall Street's consensus forecast of a 0.5 percent rise. Contracts were up 1.0 percent compared to September last year. 
""It's hard to tell whether sales are genuinely improving at a slow pace, or whether they are just moving sideways,"" said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut. ""Still, the fall in mortgage rates over the past month and ongoing labor market improvement should provide a tailwind going forward."" 

Mortgage rates have declined in tandem with a sharp fall in U.S. Treasury debt (US10YT=RR) yields as slowing global growth and a sharp sell-off in international stock markets this month prompted traders to push back expectations for an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. Last week, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate reached its lowest level since June of last year.

332,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 27, 2014 06:45AM ET</span>",German Business Morale Lowest In Nearly 2 Years,"By Reuters - German business sentiment darkened in October for a sixth month running, hitting its lowest level in almost two years which suggests that Europe's largest economy could be in for a bumpy ride in the fourth quarter.
The Munich-based Ifo think-tank's business climate index, based on a monthly survey of some 7,000 firms, fell to 103.2 from 104.7 the previous month.
That was its weakest reading since December 2012 and was below the Reuters consensus forecast for a reading of 104.3. German Bund futures rose after the release.
""We're in a downward spiral in terms of mood,"" said Andreas Scheuerle, an economist at Dekabank.
""The original mood killers - geopolitics, euro zone weakness, German economic policy and deflation concerns - have led to big downward revisions of forecasts and the weaker economic expectations are now weighing on sentiment,"" he added.
A slew of organizations including the OECD, the IMF and leading institutes have slashed their forecasts for German economic growth and the government now expects the economy to expand by just 1.2 percent this year.

While Germany steamed ahead in the first quarter, it suffered a shock 0.2 percent contraction in the second quarter and concerns are now rife that the economy will slip into a technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of declining economic activity - between July and September.
As tensions over Ukraine continue to weigh on the relationship between the West and Russia, where about 10 percent of German exporters send goods, the outlook for the remainder of the year is not rosy either.
Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe said he expected zero growth in Germany in the fourth quarter. The survey showed firms felt more downbeat about both their current situation and the future.
Recent hard data has painted a bleak picture, with industry orders, output and exports all plunging at their steepest rate since the height of the global financial crisis in 2009.
Investor morale has also plummeted recently. Consumer sentiment remains a beacon of hope, though, with a GfK survey last week showing that consumers were more optimistic heading into November. Germany's private sector also grew faster in October as manufacturing rebounded.

The Commerce Department said on Friday that sales increased 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 467,000 units, the highest reading since July 2008. August's sales rate was revised down to 466,000 units from 504,000 units.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales at a 470,000-unit pace last month.
U.S. Treasury debt prices held on to gains after the data. U.S. stocks were slightly up, while the dollar edged down against the euro.
The housing sector index (HGX) was down 0.78 percent. U.S. homebuilder PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM), which on Thursday reported a 4 percent rise in quarterly revenue from home sales, was trading more than 1 percent lower.
""We expect the housing market recovery to remain relatively gradual over the coming months,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
New home sales, which account for about 8 percent of the housing market, tend to be volatile month to month and large revisions are not unusual. Compared to September last year, sales were up 17 percent.
Housing is slowly regaining its footing after activity stalled in the second half of 2013 as mortgage rates soared. With the 30-year fixed mortgage rate falling this week to its lowest level since June of last year, sales could pick up.
Mortgage rates have declined in tandem with a sharp fall in U.S. Treasury debt yields as slowing global growth and a sharp sell-off in international stock markets prompted traders to push back expectations for an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
Slow wage growth, however, remains a constraint for an acceleration in home sales. Data this week showed sales of previously-owned homes touched a one-year high in September.
Last month, new home sales fell 8.9 percent in the West, handing back some of August's 28.1 percent surge. In the populous South, sales rose 2.0 percent, while they increased 12.3 percent in the Midwest. Sales were flat in the Northeast.
With sales rising modestly, the stock of new houses available on the market rose 1.5 percent to the highest level since July 2010. Builders have been ramping up construction and the improvement in inventory should provide buyers with more choices and temper house price increases.
At September's sales pace it would take 5.3 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, unchanged from August. Six months' supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand.

The median new home price fell 4.0 percent to $259,000 from a year ago.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 17,000 to a seasonally adjusted 283,000 for the week ended Oct. 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
Claims had declined for three straight weeks and last week's increase was in line with economists' expectations.
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 18,260 to 281,000, the lowest level since May 2000.
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the state level data.
The claims data covered the week during which the government surveys businesses for October's nonfarm payrolls. The four-week average fell 18,750 between the September and October survey periods, suggesting another month of solid employment gains.
Payrolls increased by 248,000 last month and the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent for the first time since July 2008.
The jobless claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 38,000 to 2.35 million in the week ended Oct. 11.

That was the lowest reading for the so-called continuing claims since December 2000.

LONDON (Reuters) - Euro zone businesses performed much better than anyone expected this month but did so by slashing prices again, and optimism about the future fell to its lowest level in over a year, surveys showed on Thursday. 
The growth data will provide some relief for the European Central Bank but news that firms cut prices for the 31st month, at the steepest rate in almost five years, will stoke fears of deflation in the region. 
Markit's Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index, based on surveys of thousands of companies across the region and seen as a good indicator of growth, rose to 52.2, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll. 
The poll had predicted a fall to 51.7 from September's headline reading of 52.0 and October marks the 16th month the index has been above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. 
""The overall headline number has risen but there are signs that it is going to start deteriorating again. Most worrying is the decline in new orders,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at data collator Markit. 
""And this is the most aggressive we have seen price cutting since the height of the financial crisis and it's moving in the wrong direction. It's going to raise worries about deflation."" 
Inflation slipped to its lowest for five years in September, official data showed last week, and the latest PMIs will do little to allay fears that deflation - which hit five peripheral euro zone countries last month - will spread. 
The composite output price index slumped to 47.1 from 48.5, its lowest reading since February 2010. 
Markit said the PMIs point to a 0.2 percent expansion of GDP in the current quarter, with risks to the downside. A Reuters poll last week also predicted 0.2 percent growth.  
GERMAN REBOUND 
Earlier data from Germany showed activity increased in both the manufacturing and services industries, boosted by resurgent growth among factories that was far better than anyone expected in a Reuters poll. The services PMI was weaker than predicted. 
Germany's economy, Europe's largest, contracted for the first time in over a year in the second quarter while France's, the bloc's second biggest, flatlined as it did in the first three months of the year. 
The latest flash PMI from France showed services activity shrank for a second month - and slightly more than expected - while the manufacturing industry contracted far more than even the most pessimistic economist polled by Reuters had predicted. 
Still, services firms across the euro zone, which dominate the bloc's economy, increased activity at the same pace as in September. The services PMI was unchanged at 52.4, better than the Reuters poll forecast for a fall to 52.0. 
Despite that upturn firms were less optimistic about the year ahead. The business expectations index fell to 56.2 from 59.3, its lowest reading since June last year. 
Manufacturing firms also performed better than expected. The sector's PMI was 50.7 versus a forecast for a fall to 49.9 from September's 50.3. 
An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, jumped to 51.9 from 51.0. But November may not be as strong as new orders fell for a second month with the related sub-index unchanged at 49.3. 
""New orders are a good indicator of demand so this is a pretty downbeat picture,"" Williamson said.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2014 03:56PM ET</span>",U.S. inflation muted in September as energy costs drop,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose marginally in September, painting a weak inflation picture that should give the Federal Reserve ample room to keep interest rates low for a while. 
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month as a rise in food and shelter costs offset a decline in energy prices. 
""The ongoing inflation weakness will give the Fed leeway to take a restrained approach to tightening monetary conditions,"" said Robert Hughes, senior research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. 
The CPI had dropped 0.2 percent in August and economists had expected a flat reading in September. In the 12 months through September, the CPI rose 1.7 percent after a similar gain in August. The Fed targets 2 percent inflation and tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI. 
Inflation has waned in recent months after quickening in the second quarter, with a stronger dollar and slower economic growth in China and the euro zone dampening import prices. Sluggish wage growth has also helped keep a lid on prices. 
The soft inflation backdrop and a recent global equities market sell-off has led investors to push back their expectations for when the U.S. central bank will raise interest rates from near zero to late next year. Just a few weeks ago, they had looked for a rate hike in July. 
Fed officials meet next week and their statement at the end of the two-day meeting will be watched for changes in their assessment of the inflation environment. 
Economists had expected consumer prices to hold steady last month, and U.S. Treasury debt prices slipped after the data was released, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks were trading higher, boosted by strong earnings from Yahoo Inc (O:YHOO), Broadcom (O:BRCM) and Dow Chemical (N:DOW). 
BENIGN PRICE PRESSURES 
The report showed underlying inflation pressures were also muted, despite increases in shelter and medical care costs. 
The so-called core CPI, which strips out food and energy prices, ticked up 0.1 percent last month, while the year-on-year change held steady at 1.7 percent. 
Energy prices fell for a third straight month in September, with gasoline costs slipping 1.0 percent after dropping 4.1 percent in August. 
While declining gasoline prices frees up income for other spending, tepid wage growth is blunting the impact. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation fell 0.2 percent in September and were up just 0.3 percent over the past year. 
""It is hard to have strong economic growth when spending power is largely flat,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
Food prices gained 0.3 percent in September and were up 3.0 percent from a year ago, the largest gain in nearly 2-1/2 years. 
Within the core CPI, shelter costs increased 0.3 percent in September after rising 0.2 percent in August. The shelter index was up 3.0 percent in the 12 months through September, the largest increase since January 2008. Excluding shelter, the core CPI increased only 0.9 percent from a year ago. 
The medical care index increased 0.2 percent, with prices for nonprescription drugs posting a record increase. 

Airline fares declined for a third straight month, while prices for new motor vehicles and apparel were unchanged. Prices for used cars and trucks fell for the fifth straight month.

373,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 22, 2014 10:06AM ET</span>",Bank of Canada leaves interest rate unchanged at 1%,"Investing.com - The Bank of Canada left its benchmark interest rate unchanged in October, while dropping its neutral reference about its next policy rate move, it announced on Wednesday.
The BoC said it was leaving its overnight cash rate unchanged at 1%, in line with expectations.
Canada’s real GDP growth is projected to average close to 2.5% over the next year before slowing gradually to 2.0% by the end of 2016, roughly the estimated growth rate of potential output.
Underlying inflationary pressures are muted, given the persistent slack in the economy and the continued effects of competition in the retail sector.
As the economy reaches its full capacity in the second half of 2016, both core and total CPI inflation are projected to be about 2% on a sustained basis.
""Weighing all of these factors, the Bank judges that the risks to its inflation projection are roughly balanced. Meanwhile, the financial stability risks associated with household imbalances are edging higher. Overall, the balance of risks falls within the zone for which the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate and therefore the target for the overnight rate remains at 1%.""
BoC Governor Stephen Poloz was to comment on the decision at a press conference later in the day.

Core CPI increased at annualized rate of 1.7% in August, in line with forecasts and unchanged from August.
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer-term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories. The central bank usually tries to aim for 2% core inflation or less.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales raced to a one-year high in September, the latest indication the housing market recovery is gradually getting back on track.
A separate report on Tuesday showed service sector activity in the nation's mid-Atlantic region picked up speed this month, another signal suggesting underlying strength in the economy.
The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 2.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.17 million units, the strongest reading since September of last year.
That was above economists' expectations for a rise to a 5.10 million unit pace and more than reversed August's decline, which had pushed down sales to a 5.05 million unit pace. Still, sales were 1.7 percent below those for September of last year.
""The housing recovery continues to move along sluggishly, as consumers are stuck between tight credit standards and limited wage growth,"" said Sophia Kearney-Lederman, an economist at FTN Financial in New York.
Housing is slowly regaining its footing after activity stalled in the second half of 2013 following a run-up in mortgage rates. While it continues to be hobbled by sluggish wage growth, a recent decline in mortgage rates should help support sales.
The 30-year mortgage rate fell to an average of 3.97 percent last week from 4.12 percent in the week ended Oct. 9, according to data from mortgage finance firm Freddie Mac. The decline reflected a sharp drop in U.S. Treasury debt yields as traders pushed back expectations for the first interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve against a backdrop of troubling economic news from overseas and a big sell-off in global stock markets.
FIRST-TIME BUYERS SIDELINED
The housing data helped U.S. stocks to extend gains. The housing sector index (HGX) rose 1.3 percent, with shares of homebuilder Pulte Group (N:PHM) gaining 2.18 percent and those of KB Home (N:KBH) increasing 2.45 percent.
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell, while the dollar rose against a basket of currencies.
In a separate report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its gauge of non-manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region rose to 44.1 in October from 35.7 in September.
Measures of new orders and sales both increased, but a reading on service sector jobs slipped, suggesting a slower pace of improvement in the labor market.
While home sales picked up last month, first-time buyers, a critical component for a sustainable recovery, remained on the sidelines. They accounted for 29 percent of sales for a third straight month, below the 40 percent to 45 percent that is considered ideal by economists and real estate agents.
""We need to see more first-time buyers both willing and able to buy, without the support of excessively easy credit, if we really want to see a healthier and more sustained recovery in housing,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
Investors, who had supported the market, have been withdrawing. They accounted for only 14 percent of transactions last month, down from 19 percent in September of last year.
The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 6 percent from a year ago to 2.30 million. At September's sales pace, it would take 5.3 months to clear houses from the market, down from 5.5. months in August. A six months' supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

With supply improving, house price gains continue to moderate. The median home price rose 5.6 percent in September from a year ago, but that was down from the double-digit growth seen for much of 2013.

Sales are now at their highest pace of 2014, but still remain 1.7% below the 5.26 million-unit level from last September.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2014 03:23AM ET</span>","China's growth slowest since global crisis, annual target at risk","By Jake Spring and Xiaoyi Shao 
BEIJING (Reuters) - China grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis in the September quarter and risks missing its official target for the first time in 15 years, adding to concerns the world's second-largest economy is becoming a drag on global growth. 
A pick-up in factory output and government confidence that the labor market remains stable were offset by further slowing in the property sector, and economists remained divided on whether or not authorities would step in with major stimulus measures such as interest rate cuts. 
China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.3 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, the weakest rate since the first quarter of 2009. 
That was slightly above the 7.2 percent forecast by analysts but slower than 7.5 percent in the second quarter, and even then some economists were surprised. 
""It's hard to square the GDP print with the industrial production numbers for the quarter,"" said Andrew Polk, economist at the Conference Board in Beijing, one of the more pessimistic research houses on the Chinese economy. 
""There are confusing things going on. You have credit growing at the slowest pace since 2002. You have real estate investment slowing on a monthly basis and you have industrial production averaging slightly above 8 percent on a quarterly basis, slightly down from Q2. With that being the most reliable component of GDP on a quarterly basis, 7.3 percent seems a bit high to me."" 
JOB MARKET IS KEY 
The data added to expectations that growth will come in below the official 2014 target of 7.5 percent, which would be the first miss since 1999. 
Premier Li Keqiang has stated repeatedly that authorities will tolerate growth slightly below target as they try to reshape the economy so it is driven more by domestic consumption and less by exports and investment. 
Li has indicated that the leadership's bottom line is maintaining employment to ward off social unrest, a policy priority. The government has said growth of 7.2 percent is needed to keep employment steady. 
""Although economic growth has slowed in the third quarter, our employment and inflation situation are generally stable, which means the economy is still operating in a reasonable range,"" statistics bureau spokesperson Sheng Laiyun said. 
Private and official business surveys have suggested pressure on employment for much of the year, though there have been no reports of widespread layoffs. 
PROPERTY HEADWINDS 
A weakening property market continued to weigh on broader activity in the third quarter, with revenue from property sales revenue and new construction tumbling in the first nine months of 2014, blunting the impact of earlier stimulus measures and a long-awaited pick-up in exports. 
""The weakest part of China's economy is still the property sector,"" said Wang Tao, analyst at UBS in Hong Kong. 
""The government has relaxed some controls recently and property sales may pick up in the fourth quarter. However, we may not see improvement in sectors like heavy industry and we expect the economy to continue to slow down."" 
With house price declines spreading to a record number of cities and new construction tumbling, the government last month cut mortgage rates for some home buyers for the first time since the global financial crisis. 
FEW BRIGHT SPOTS 
Other data showed factory output rose 8.0 percent in September from a year earlier, beating expectations and marking a recovery from August's six-year low of 6.9 percent. 
But that appeared to be the lone bright spot. Fixed asset investment, an important driver of the economy, was weaker than expected, as were retail sales. 
That followed data last week which showed inflation cooled to a near five-year low, highlighting sluggish domestic demand and a lack of pricing power for firms. 
""While we do not see China will fall into a 'hard landing' scenario, we do see the risk of deflation is rising sharply,"" ANZ economists said in a note. 
The statistics agency downplayed that risk, saying there was no danger that consumer prices would fall in coming months. 
While authorities have offered a steady stream of aid to more vulnerable sectors of the economy, they have ruled out massive stimulus as the country is still struggling with a mountain of debt, the hangover from 4 trillion yuan (US$650 billion) of stimulus rolled out during 2008/09 global crisis.Government economists at top think tanks have said that if growth looked like dropping below 7 percent, authorities may take bolder and broader steps such as interest rate cuts. 
""Today's numbers don't really suggest they have to do a big stimulus,"" said Tim Condon, ING's head of Asian research in Singapore. 
""They can continue targeted measures. They've done quite a bit in the last couple of weeks. Maybe that's enough.""

393,By Investing.com,"<span>Oct 20, 2014 08:33PM ET</span>",RBA October board meeting minutes repeat period of stability,"Investing.com - The following is the full-text statement released Tuesday of the board meeting minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's October rate decision.Members PresentGlenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, Heather Ridout AO, Catherine TannaJenny Wilkinson (Acting Executive Director (Domestic), Macroeconomic Group, Treasury) attended in place of Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury) in terms of section 22 of the Reserve Bank Act 1959.Others PresentGuy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary)International Economic ConditionsThe global data released over the past month suggested that Australia's major trading partners had continued to grow at around their long-run average pace over the past year, although there had been quarterly volatility in growth in some of the major economies through the year. Inflationary pressures had remained contained across all major regions.In China, some indicators of economic conditions had softened a little. Members were briefed that the Chinese authorities had scope to ease policy if needed to support GDP growth. In the property market, conditions had continued to soften and the government had announced policy changes designed to support the market. After discussing the potential impact of these changes on the housing cycle in China, members noted that the flow of overall non-bank financing had eased further, possibly reflecting recent additional regulatory measures aimed at limiting this type of finance. They also noted that the authorities' target for employment growth in 2014 as a whole was already close to being achieved.In Japan, economic activity appeared to have picked up only a little following the decline in the June quarter, which had been due to the effect of the increase in the consumption tax earlier in the year. Overall, prospects for growth remained unclear, even though labour market conditions had been relatively tight, with average labour earnings having increased a little over the past year. Members observed that growth in output in the rest of east Asia had been a bit below its decade average in recent quarters. East Asian trade had grown steadily and remained relatively stable as a share of world trade.The US economy looked to have been growing at around, or even a little above, trend, with business investment picking up noticeably and labour market conditions improving further. The unemployment rate had continued to decline, reflecting solid growth in payrolls in recent months, though members noted the low participation rate and relatively elevated measures of underemployment.In the euro area, there had been little change in output in recent months and inflation remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB). In response, the ECB had announced further stimulatory measures at its September meeting.Members noted that iron ore prices had declined further over the past month, reaching their lowest level since September 2009. The decline over the past year had reflected a combination of increased Australian and global supply and, more recently, some softening in the growth of Chinese demand for steel, perhaps resulting in part from weaker conditions in the housing market. Members observed that most Australian iron ore production remained profitable at these lower prices and that increased pressures on global higher-cost mines would be expected, in time, to lead to reductions in their production. The prices of other commodities had declined a little over the past month in SDR terms, but were little changed in Australian dollar terms given the depreciation of the exchange rate.Domestic Economic ConditionsThe June quarter national accounts had been released the day after the September Board meeting. The accounts showed an increase in real GDP of 0.5 per cent in the quarter and a little more than 3 per cent over the year, in line with the forecasts published in the August Statement on Monetary Policy. Members noted that a decline in resource exports in the June quarter had followed very strong growth in the previous two quarters, which meant that resource exports had made a significant contribution to year-ended growth. Consumption recorded moderate growth in the first half of 2014. Over the year to June 2014, consumption had grown faster than real disposable income, resulting in a further decline in the savings ratio. Growth in dwelling investment had been strong, whereas mining and non-mining business investment in aggregate had fallen over the year.More recent data and liaison had suggested that moderate growth of consumption had continued into the September quarter. The two key measures of consumer sentiment had diverged, with one around average levels and the other still a bit below average. Members noted that consumption was also likely to be supported by the ongoing strength in the housing market.Dwelling investment had increased by more than 8 per cent over the year to the June quarter, and continued strength in building approvals and other indicators pointed to further growth in coming quarters. House price growth had been a little slower, on average, over 2014 than in late 2013, but remained consistent with strong conditions in the established housing market. Over the previous six months, overall housing credit growth had been steady at around 7 per cent in annualised terms, but members noted that growth of investor credit had increased to close to 10 per cent.Mining investment increased slightly in the June quarter, but was still expected to decline significantly over the course of 2014/15. Non-mining business investment was little changed over the year to the June quarter, but members noted that data from the capital expenditure survey indicated that this component of business investment was likely to increase moderately in 2014/15. Measures of business conditions and confidence had remained around, or a little above, their long-run averages. Information from liaison indicated that the cost and availability of finance did not appear to have been restraining business investment.Members recognised that historically slow wage growth outcomes were consistent with spare capacity in the labour market. They also noted that the recent labour force data had been quite volatile, suggesting the possibility of some measurement problems. The unemployment rate in August had retraced the sharp rise recorded in July to be close to 6 per cent, around the average of the monthly unemployment rate over the year to date. Employment had reportedly increased substantially in August, driven by an exceptionally strong rise in part-time employment. Looking at a broader range of data, members concluded that labour market conditions remained subdued, although they appeared to have stabilised somewhat over the course of 2014 to date. Forward-looking indicators had picked up a little, but still pointed to only modest employment growth over the coming months.Financial MarketsMembers opened their discussion of financial markets with the observation that central banks were the main focus of attention in September and volatility had picked up a little from very low levels, predominantly in currency markets.The US Federal Reserve had maintained its guidance in September that the federal funds rate was likely to remain unchanged for a ‘considerable time’ and thereafter rise only gradually. There were small upward shifts to Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' projections for the federal funds rate for 2015, with individual members' projections continuing to diverge substantially.In contrast, the ECB had unexpectedly reduced by a further 10 basis points both its policy rate, to 5 basis points, and its deposit rate, to -20 basis points, in September. The ECB had also announced that from October it would purchase ‘simple and transparent’ euro area asset-backed securities, including residential mortgage-backed securities, and covered bonds. While no explicit target was set, the ECB's intention appears to be to expand its balance sheet back to its crisis peak, which would be around 1 trillion euros larger than at present, through a combination of targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) and asset purchases. The ECB conducted the first of the TLTROs during September, with the take-up being lower than expected.The decisions of the FOMC and the ECB were followed by sizeable movements in exchange rates, with the US dollar appreciating across the board, including against the Australian dollar. While an appreciation of the US dollar had been anticipated for some time, the exact timing of the appreciation was difficult to explain. The appreciation was associated with an increase in volatility in the main currency pairs, albeit only back towards typical levels. The euro had depreciated by 9 per cent since early May to be at its lowest level against the US dollar in two years, while emerging market currencies had generally depreciated against the US dollar as well. The notable exception was the Chinese renminbi (RMB), which had been little changed against the US dollar and had appreciated in trade-weighted terms by 5 per cent over the preceding year.Members noted that the Australian dollar had depreciated by 4 per cent in trade-weighted terms over September. This was primarily a 6 per cent depreciation against a rising US dollar (and the RMB), although weaker-than-expected Chinese economic data and further declines in key commodity prices had contributed to some additional softening of the Australian dollar. The recent depreciation followed a period when the Australian dollar had held up against the US dollar more than most other currencies, and meant that the Australian dollar was now around its January low against the US dollar but remained a little higher on a trade-weighted basis than earlier in the year.Members observed that US sovereign bond yields had fluctuated over September, with German, UK and Australian bond yields generally tracking the moves in US yields.Share prices in the developed economies had declined over the past month, with the exception of Japan, where share prices had risen strongly in conjunction with a sizeable depreciation of the yen. Australian share prices had underperformed equity markets in other developed economies in September; concerns about the pace of economic growth in China and falls in commodity price had adversely affected the share prices of domestic resource companies, and the share prices of banks had also weakened.Members concluded their discussion of financial markets by observing that lending rates in Australia continued to edge down marginally in September. Financial markets continued to expect that the cash rate would be unchanged at the October meeting and over the following 12 months.Considerations for Monetary PolicyGrowth in the global economy was continuing at a moderate pace. Commodity prices, in particular iron ore prices, had declined over the past month. This was consistent with both the ongoing increase in iron ore supply and further weakening of the Chinese property market, which is an important source of demand for steel. Global financial conditions remained very accommodative and the Australian dollar had depreciated somewhat, largely reflecting a broad-based appreciation of the US dollar.As expected, the domestic economy had grown moderately in the June quarter, following a strong March quarter result. The outcome was supported by strong growth in dwelling investment and steady consumption growth. Members noted that more timely indicators suggested that moderate growth overall had continued into the September quarter.Faced with volatility in the labour force survey results, members based their assessment of the labour market on a range of indicators. These suggested that conditions in the labour market remained subdued but had stabilised somewhat this year. While forward-looking indicators pointed to modest employment growth in the months ahead, there was a degree of spare capacity in the labour market and it would probably be some time before the unemployment rate declined consistently. Wage growth was expected to remain relatively slow in the near term, which should help to maintain inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate.Members noted that the current setting of monetary policy was accommodative, with lending rates remaining very low and continuing to edge lower over recent months as competition to lend had increased. In this context, members discussed the importance of lenders maintaining strong lending standards and the ongoing dialogue between the Bank and APRA on the matter.Continued accommodative monetary policy was expected to support demand and help growth to strengthen over time. To date, this had been most apparent in the housing market, where dwelling investment had picked up and was expected to remain strong following the rapid rise in housing prices and high levels of approvals. Credit growth had remained moderate overall, but in recent months there had been a further pick-up in lending to investors in housing. Despite the easing in financial conditions associated with the depreciation of the Australian dollar, the exchange rate remained high by historical standards – particularly given recent declines in key commodity prices – and was offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy.Given the information available, the Board's judgement was that the current stance of monetary policy continued to be appropriate for fostering sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target over the period ahead. Members considered that the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.The DecisionThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

401,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2014 01:34PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer sentiment rises despite Ebola fears,"By Jason Lange WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While the appearance of the deadly Ebola virus in Texas is worrying the nation, it has yet to lead Americans to take a more cautious view over how to spend their money, data suggested on Friday.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment unexpectedly rose in early October to its highest level since July 2007.
Separate data showed groundbreaking for new homes rose more than expected last month, and taken together the reports pointed to solid U.S. economic growth.
""The underlying strength of the U.S. economy remains intact,"" said David Berson, an economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance in Columbus, Ohio. ""If it were not for Ebola and geopolitical concerns, these (sentiment) numbers would be higher.""
The data for the sentiment survey was collected between Sept. 25 and Oct. 15, a period in which Americans have been barraged by news of Ebola's spread in West Africa, where it has killed thousands, and its appearance in the United States.
U.S. officials have confirmed three Ebola cases, all in Dallas, since Sept. 30 - a Liberian man who later died of the disease and two nurses who had cared for him and are now being treated.
Investors have been concerned that Ebola, if not contained in the United States, could scare consumers and lead them to cut back on spending, though there is little sign of that so far.
The consumer sentiment survey period also overlapped with the global stock market sell-off earlier this week.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the sentiment index to fall, but instead it ticked two tenths of a point higher to 86.4. Consumers were more upbeat about their personal finances and the national economy.
Other measures of consumer confidence have also failed to show much alarm. Gallup's daily poll of economic sentiment has been stable in recent weeks. At least when it comes to spending decisions, consumers remain focused on a strengthening economy.
""Despite rising media coverage, Ebola seems to have had little discernible effect on consumer sentiment to date,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Kris Dawsey said.
The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 5.9 percent last month, a six-year low. Investors think the stronger job market will lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next year after holding them near zero since 2008, though worries about the global economy and chronically low inflation have recently led them to bet the hike would be delayed until late in the year.
HOUSING RECOVERY INTACT
A stronger job market helped the housing market recovery to advance last month, with groundbreaking at building sites rising more than expected.
Housing starts rose 6.3 percent to an annual 1.02 million-unit pace, the Commerce Department said, the latest sign the sector was continuing to claw back after the implosion that touched off the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.
Newly issued permits also rose.
""If you look at the trend, you are still seeing an upward trajectory,"" said Michelle Meyers, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.

U.S. stock prices jumped following a batch of solid corporate earnings reports, including profits by General Electric (N:GE) that topped analyst expectations. Share prices had fallen sharply earlier in the week, and the bounceback sucked money away from U.S. government debt, pushing yields higher for a second straight day.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary October reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 86.4, the highest since July 2007. The gains were unexpected, as a Reuters survey showed a forecast for a slip to 84.1 from last month's 84.6 reading.
""The data show absolutely no signs that fear and panic is about to overtake the consumer sector,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement, referring to ""broader concerns about the global economic meltdown, escalating military conflicts, and rising concerns about Ebola.""
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations also rose to hit 78.4, the highest since October 2012, from 75.4 and beating a forecast for 74.4.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions was unchanged at 98.9 and also beat its forecast of 98.0.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 2.8 percent from 3.0 percent, while the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook held steady at 2.8 percent.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2014 05:52PM ET</span>",Data shows U.S. economy's pulse is still strong ,"By Jason Lange WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell to a 14-year low last week and industrial output rose sharply in September, positive signals that helped ease fears over the economic outlook.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 23,000 to 264,000, the lowest level since 2000, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
A separate report from the Federal Reserve showed production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities advanced a larger-than-expected 1.0 percent last month, the biggest gain since November 2012.
The data offered evidence the economy remained on solid ground, with the labor market gaining steam. Investors in recent days have come to the view that slowing growth overseas will weigh on the U.S. economy and force the Fed to delay a hike in interest rates, with weak retail sales data on Wednesday helping to fuel a global sell-off in stock markets.
The jobless claims report, however, reinforced expectations that slack in the labor market was being reduced and, combined with comments from a top Fed official, put a brake on the selling on Wall Street.
""Have we achieved full employment? Not yet. Are we getting closer? Absolutely,"" said Stephen Stanley, an economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index (SPX) closed up marginally, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrials (DJI) slipped a bit further. Yields on U.S. government bonds (US10YT=RR) moved higher.
Some of last week's drop in claims may have been related to the Columbus Day holiday, economists at RBS told clients.
The government, however, said there were no unusual factors in the report, and a four-week moving average of claims, which irons out weekly volatility, also fell to its lowest since 2000.
OASIS OF PROSPERITY?
A Reuters poll published on Thursday showed economists still clinging to the view that the Fed would raise benchmark borrowing costs from near zero in the second quarter of next year despite mounting signs of weakness overseas.
The poll, however, was largely completed before the latest stock market sell-off, which has been accompanied by a big shift in investor expectations for the path of U.S. monetary policy. Interest rate futures now point to a rate hike in October 2015.
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said in a television interview with Bloomberg that the U.S. central bank might want to keep its bond-buying stimulus program running for longer than anticipated to combat the risk of a drop in already low inflation, comments that eased investors' nerves.
But with the U.S. economy motoring ahead, many analysts said they expected Bullard's advice to fall by the wayside.
Economists still expect third-quarter growth to come in at around a 3 percent annual rate, a view buttressed by the pickup in industrial output.
The Fed pinned part of the gain on unusual weather that boosted air-conditioning use but there was also a broad-based increase in factory output, which grew a solid 0.5 percent.

A third report from the Fed's Philadelphia branch showed slowing growth in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region.

September was the 48th consecutive month of year-on-year declines in overall foreclosure activity, which includes foreclosure notices, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions.

The Fed's beige book, a compilation of anecdotal reporting from district banks, says the Fed believes consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the economy's output, is improving. 

Retailers are optimistic about sales through the rest of the year, particularly from tourism, though New York retailers reported weaker sales than from September's report. Most districts also say their real estate and banking markets are growing as overall employment expands. And though wage growth remains modest, Fed officials say pressures to raise wages within industries such as construction are increasing. 
""Most Districts reported overall growth in consumer spending that ranged from slight to moderate,"" the report said. 
The findings are similar to those in the previous beige book released in September, which reported that most wage growth is going to skilled workers. "
434,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2014 05:05PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales, producer prices give cautionary signs on economy","By Jason Lange 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales declined in September as consumers pulled back on spending for a range of items, a worrisome economic signal that helped fuel a sell-off on Wall Street. 
The report on Wednesday, along with data showing a drop in producer prices, led investors to bet the Federal Reserve would delay hiking interest rates until late 2015 at the earliest to keep support for the economy in place. 
Retail sales, which account for about one-third of consumer spending, dropped 0.3 percent last month, the Commerce Department said. It was the first decrease since January. 
Economists had expected a decline given a slower pace of sales reported by automakers and a fall in gasoline prices that cut into receipts at service stations. 
But the breadth of the weakness was surprising. Sales were down 0.2 percent even when stripping out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services. Economists polled by Reuters had predicted an increase in this reading, which provides a pretty good gauge of overall consumer spending. 
""Consumers have turned more cautious,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, who cut his third-quarter economic growth forecast to 3.1 percent from 3.4 percent on the figures.  
Prices for U.S. stocks tumbled as much as 3 percent during the day, although the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down just 0.8 percent. Investors, already spooked by signs of economic weakness overseas, rushed into the safe haven of U.S. government debt, pushing yields down sharply, while the dollar fell against the euro and the yen. 
INFLATION UNDER WRAPS 
Sales at clothing retailers dropped 1.2 percent and receipts at sporting goods shops edged down 0.1 percent. Overall sales would have fallen further but the release of Apple's iPhone 6 lifted sales at electronics and appliance stores. 
Receipts at auto dealers fell 0.8 percent, as did sales at service stations. 
Sounding a less dour note, the Fed said in its so-called Beige Book that the economy continued to expand at a ""modest to moderate"" pace across much of the nation in recent weeks. 
Wage growth, however, remained modest in most areas, even as employers bid up wages in some particular industries, it said. 
With wages under wraps, inflation has failed to gain a toehold, and the Fed said businesses reported little if any change in prices over the past several weeks. 
In a separate report, the Labor Department said prices received by U.S. producers actually fell 0.1 percent in September, the first decline in more than a year. 
While Fed officials have been concerned that inflation has been stuck below their 2 percent target, other signs of strength in the economy had left them optimistic they would finally be able to raise benchmark overnight rates from zero by mid-2015. 
As recently as Tuesday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams told Reuters the central bank should only delay a rate hike if inflation or wages failed to perk up. 

The reports on Wednesday suggested he may be kept waiting a bit longer. ""Little inflation pressure (is) in the pipeline,"" economists at RBS said in a note to clients.

440,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2014 08:44AM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales give cautionary sign on consumer demand,"WASHINGTON - U.S. retail sales declined in September even when factoring out weakness at auto dealers and gasoline stations, providing a surprisingly cautionary sign for the strength of consumer demand. 
Total retail sales dropped 0.3 percent during the month, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Drops in receipts at gasoline stations and auto dealers dragged on the reading. 
Analysts had expected a fall in retail sales, as auto production has cooled and oil prices have fallen sharply in recent months on signs of slowing global economic growth. 
What came as more of a surprise was a drop in so-called core sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, and correspond most closely with the consumer 
spending component of gross domestic product. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the reading to increase. Instead, it fell 0.2 percent in September. 
Sales at clothing retailers dropped 1.2 percent and receipts at sporting goods shops edged 0.1 percent lower. 
Sales at electronics and appliance stores, however, jumped 3.4 percent, while receipts at building materials and garden equipment suppliers declined 1.1 percent. 
Receipts at auto dealerships fell 0.8 percent, as did sales at service stations. The drop in gasoline sales reflected declining oil prices and is potentially positive for the broader 
economy. This could free up income and support discretionary spending in the months ahead. 
Retail sales account for a third of consumer spending.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. small business optimism fell in September as more owners said they expected a slowdown in profits and sales, tightening credit conditions and a harder time filling job openings, according to a survey released on Tuesday.
The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index fell 0.8 point to 95.3. The index is now five points below where it was before the start of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.
Six of the index's 10 components fell in the survey of 608 randomly-selected small business owners.
Still, more business owners said they believed it was a good time to expand their firms and expected better conditions in six months.
Owners added an average of 0.24 workers per firm last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement from August's average of 0.02 workers.
Half of the owners said they had hired or tried to hire in the last three months, although 42 percent said they had a hard time finding qualified candidates.
The survey suggests weaker job creation as those surveyed said they planned to hire fewer workers and spend less on capital investments.

""Overall, no progress, still stuck in a rut that has been difficult to escape with so little progress on the issues important to small business owners,"" NFIB chief economist William Dunkelberg said, referring to the survey results.

“A decline in job openings and capital spending plans were primarily responsible for September’s Index decline. Overall, small business owners are still stuck in a rut that has been difficult to escape,” said NFIB chief economist Bill Dunkelberg.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to nearly its lowest level since before the 2007-09 recession, a sign of growing steam in the U.S. labor market. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 287,000 in the week ended Oct. 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists had expected claims to rise. 
The data adds to the view that strength is building in the U.S. economy. ""The labor market is entering into a potential boom,"" said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. 
Still, Federal Reserve officials remain concerned about persistently low rates of inflation and are not seen in a rush to hike interest rates with the economies of key trading partners flagging. 
A separate report showed U.S. wholesale inventories rose by the most in four months in August, a sign the economy may have grown more than expected in the third quarter. 
Many economists think the economy grew at an annual rate of around 3 percent in the July-September period, much faster than average rates over the last few years. 
U.S. stocks opened lower as investors took profits after a big rally on Wednesday that had been fueled by minutes of the Fed's last policy meeting, which suggested an interest rate hike could be delayed because of growing concerns on the international outlook. 
The U.S. dollar, which had been on a long run up through last week, slid to a three-week low against the Japanese yen on Thursday, while yields on U.S. government debt rose modestly. 
Jobless claims have fallen steadily since the nation emerged from the recession and are currently lower than they were before the country's economic crisis began. Indeed, the level of claims last week was just 8,000 above a 14-year low reached in July. 
The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 7,250 to 287,750, its lowest level since 2006. 
The Labor Department said there were no special factors influencing the state level claims data. 
The report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 21,000 to 2.38 million in the week ended Sept. 27. 

""The gradual improvement in continuing claims is particularly encouraging and is consistent with recent declines in the unemployment rate, suggesting that unemployed workers continue to find gainful employment,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. strategist at TD Securities in New York.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports plunged in August by their largest amount since the height of the financial crisis and leading institutes slashed their forecasts for growth, fuelling a debate on whether Berlin is doing enough to prop up Europe's economy and its own. 
Exports slumped by 5.8 percent, the biggest drop since January 2009, in the latest sign that Europe's largest economy is faltering amid broader euro zone weakness and crises abroad that have battered confidence and led German firms to postpone investment plans. 
""The economy seems to need a small miracle in September to avoid a recession in the third quarter,"" said Carsten Brzeski, an economist at ING. 
The Federal Statistics Office said late-falling summer vacations in some German states had contributed to a fall in both exports and imports, but the figures still painted a gloomy picture for an economy that until recently was hailed in Berlin as Europe's ""growth locomotive"". 
Earlier this week, industrial orders and output data suffered their steepest drops in more than five years. 
Hours after the trade data was released, a group of leading economic institutes joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in slashing forecasts for German growth. The institutes are now expecting growth of 1.3 percent this year and 1.2 percent next, down from 1.9 and 2.0 percent previously. 
The institutes also urged the government to cut corporate taxes, spend more on infrastructure and education, and take steps to encourage private investment, stressing that there was sufficient ""financial room for maneuver"". 
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has faced pressure from within Germany as well as from ailing European states such as France and Italy to ratchet up public investment instead of prioritizing deficit reduction. 
So far, however, Berlin has made clear that its top priority is to deliver on its promise of a ""schwarze Null"" - a federal budget that is in the black, or fully balanced - in 2015. 
""PRESTIGE PROJECT"" 
The institutes criticized this dogged focus, with Ferdinand Fichtner of Germany's DIW research institute deriding the balanced budget goal as a ""prestige project"" with ""no immediate economic significance"". 
""There are surpluses in the public budget which could be used to increase investment,"" he told a news conference to present the institutes' report. 
Merkel, speaking later at a news conference in Berlin with the visiting Polish prime minister, said the government was preparing for lower growth by ""considering how to encourage extra investment, cut bureaucracy and invest in the future."" She named energy and IT as two possible areas of focus. 
The institutes further criticized Merkel's 10-month-old government for dampening growth by introducing a minimum wage and allowing some workers to retire early at 63 with full pension benefits. These remain unpopular with some in her party. 
""It is plain that many of the government's policies have dampened instead of supported growth,"" Joachim Pfeiffer, a lawmaker in Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) told Reuters. 
Germany had a strong start to the year but shrank by 0.2 percent in the second quarter. Evidence is mounting that it barely grew in the third quarter and some economists are forecasting another contraction in that period, which would amount to a technical recession. 
The IMF, European Central Bank and Berlin's partners in Rome and Paris have all called on Merkel to spend more to avert a new European recession and Japanese-style deflationary spiral. 
British finance minister George Osborne warned on Thursday that the euro zone risked ""slipping back into crisis"". 
A growing number of economists argue that decades of weak investment in Germany have turned into the Achilles heel of the economy. The DIW institute estimates that the country is suffering from an annual investment gap of 80 billion euros. 

At the start of the 1990s, public and private investment represented 23 percent of German gross domestic product (GDP). Now it is hovering around 17 percent - compared to an OECD average of 20 percent.

The services purchasing managers' index (PMI) compiled by HSBC/Markit pulled back to 53.5 in September from a 17-month high of 54.1 in August.
A reading above 50 in PMI surveys indicates an expansion in activity while one below that threshold points to a contraction.
A sub-index measuring new business fell to 53.2 in September from a 19-month high of 53.9 in August, but sub-indexes measuring employment and outstanding business both inched up, painting a mixed picture.
""Overall, the services sector held up in September, despite the downward pressure seen in the manufacturing sector. We think risks to growth in the near term are still on the downside, and warrant accommodative monetary as well as fiscal policies,"" said Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC.
An official survey released last week showed that the services sector grew at its slowest pace in eight months in September after new orders shrank for the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis, exposing more weakness in the world's second-largest economy.
The services sector made up 46.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, surpassing the secondary sector – manufacturing and construction – for the first time, as the government aims to create more jobs and boost domestic consumption.
DOWNSIDE RISKS
Last week, a pair of surveys showed China's manufacturing sector held up in September but remained subdued in a sign that the economy is still struggling to recover its growth momentum -despite recent policy support.
Steps unveiled since April included reserve requirement cuts for selected banks and faster investment in railways and public housing. But much of their broader impact may have been offset by a cooling property market and tighter credit as banks grow more cautious about lending as the economy cools.
In a bid to avert a deeper slide in the housing market, China's central bank and banking regulator relaxed lending rules for second-home buyers on Sept. 30 by giving them a 30 percent discount on mortgage rates and cutting their down payment levels to 30 percent from 60-70 percent.
""We think the easing lending condition is more impactful compared with unwinding of previous housing purchase restrictions. As such, we expect the systemic risk arising from property sector to be contained,"" OCBC said in a research note on Wednesday.
Other economists are not so sure. A glut of unsold and unoccupied homes and buyers' expectations of further price declines could temper any rebound.
The central bank said on Sunday it will use various monetary tools to maintain adequate liquidity and reasonable growth in credit and social financing. Analysts expect more policy measures will be needed to help achieve the government's growth target of around 7.5 percent this year, although any dramatic stimulus looks unlikely as reform-minded top leaders have shown greater tolerance for slower growth.
The government is due to release September data on trade, bank lending, investment and factory output in the coming week or so, leading up to third-quarter GDP on Oct. 21
""The upcoming September data release will likely show a tentative improvement in real economic activity, but unlikely be
strong enough to prevent full third-quarter growth from falling to 7.1 percent year on year, adding pressure on the government to further intensify policy support,"" Tao Wang, China economist at USB, said in a note.
The economy expanded by 7.5 percent in the second quarter on-year.

522,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 07, 2014 01:02PM ET</span>",Delinquency Rates on Consumer Loans Fall to Record Low,"By Catherine Dunn - Americans are doing better job paying their debts on time. Consumer delinquency rates on personal loans, direct auto loans, and home improvement loans fell during the second quarter, according to new figures released Tuesday by the American Bankers Association.
Delinquencies, or payments that are late by 30 days or more, dropped in nine of the 11 categories the ABA tracks.
Another measure of delinquencies across eight types of loans, called the composite ratio, fell to a historic low as just 1.57 percent of accounts were delinquent during the April-June period. The measure was ""well under the 15-year average of 2.32 percent,"" the ABA noted in the release. The ABA has been tracking the composite ratio since the 1970s.
""When you see delinquencies fall nearly across the board, and are at record low levels, it says consumers have done a really good job bringing their balances down, making sure they can repay their debts and being good stewards of their finances,” said ABA chief economist James Chessen. 
The improving numbers reflect good financial maintenance on the part of consumers, but banks are playing a role too. Chessen noted that creditors are ""being more cautious about who they lend to."" 
“Both consumers and lenders have been more conservative in their approach to credit,” he added.   
A slow-recovering economy is also helping to shrink delinquency rates, but barriers to further improvement may lie ahead. 
“Incomes are not rising as fast as we’d all like. There are challenges,” he said. ""That's why I’m very glad delinquency rates are so low, but with a still less-than-great economy, there’s still some danger rates will rise in the future.”

Growth in the global economy is continuing at a moderate pace. China's growth has generally been in line with policymakers' objectives, though some data suggest a slowing in recent months. Weakening property markets there present a challenge in the near term. Commodity prices in historical terms remain high, but some of those important to Australia have declined further in recent months.Volatility in some financial markets has picked up in recent weeks. Overall, however, financial conditions remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and risk spreads remain very low. Markets still appear to be attaching a low probability to any rise in global interest rates or other adverse event over the period ahead.In Australia, most data are consistent with moderate growth in the economy. Resources sector investment spending is starting to decline significantly, while some other areas of private demand are seeing expansion, at varying rates. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued. Overall, the Bank still expects growth to be a little below trend for the next several quarters.Labour market data have been unusually volatile of late. The Bank's assessment remains that although some forward indicators of employment have been firming this year, the labour market has a degree of spare capacity and it will probably be some time yet before unemployment declines consistently. Growth in wages has declined noticeably and is expected to remain relatively modest over the period ahead, which should keep inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate.Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and have continued to edge lower over recent months as competition to lend has increased. Investors continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth is moderate overall, but with a further pick-up in recent months in lending to investors in housing assets. Dwelling prices have continued to rise over recent months.The exchange rate has declined recently, in large part reflecting the strengthening US dollar, but remains high by historical standards, particularly given the further declines in key commodity prices in recent months. It is offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy.Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand and help growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.

Following the 2007-09 financial crisis, many of Britain's banks and financial services firms were forced to trim costs and cut jobs and cope with a raft of new regulations.
According to the latest quarterly review of the industry by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and consultancy PwC, firms may be starting to move on from the painful period of restructuring.
Business volumes grew at their fastest rate since 2007 in the quarter to September, while 60 percent of firms reported greater profits, the survey of 109 companies found.
That trend is expected to continue in the current quarter, with the majority of firms forecasting another period of rising volumes and profits.
Respondents said competition was among their main concerns for the coming year, which suggested companies were looking for opportunities to grow.
""The sector could be moving to a new phase in the recovery where firms are feeling more assured about the level of demand and are now shifting their gaze to competing for new customers and business,"" Rain Newton-Smith, CBI's director for economics, said in a statement that accompanied the report.
Separate research from recruitment firm Astbury Marsden said financial sector firms in London, home to around a third of the industry's workers, created 3,470 new jobs in September, 46 percent more than the same period last year.
Many of the new roles were in compliance and regulatory functions, and stronger equity markets have created a need for more dealmakers and front office staff.
""We are now also starting to see many employers feel that the time is right to drive business growth by building up their revenue earning teams,"" said Adam Jackson, a director at Astbury Marsden.
""As the IPO (initial public offering) and M&A (mergers and acquisitions) markets heat up, this will have a positive knock-on effect on hiring in equities trading, broking and corporate finance departments,"" he added.
M&A volumes rose by more 60 percent to $2.7 trillion in the first nine months of the year, while equity capital market deals were up by a quarter at $678.1 billion, Thomson Reuters data showed last week. That spike in activity sent investment banking fees up by 13 percent to $68.8 billion in the year to end-September.
Astbury Marsden said firms were also hiring in technology in response to regulatory demands for improvements to data protection systems.
Large investment banks want staff to help identify and counter threats to the integrity of their IT infrastructure, the recruiter added.

""The cyber security jobs market has grown rapidly in recent months, and the banks are actively recruiting information security specialists to shore up their technology teams,"" Jackson said.

546,By International Business Times,"<span>Oct 04, 2014 02:00AM ET</span>",Here's The Best Part Of Strong US Jobs Report,"By Meagan Clark - By headline numbers alone, the government's latest snapshot of the American job market reinforced the sense that the economy has finally regained momentum. The unemployment rate dipped to 5.9 percent last month, the first time since the summer of 2008 that this closely watched number has fallen below 6 percent. The economy added a net 248,000, a far stronger showing than most economists had been expecting.
But the clearest sign of a reinvigorated economy came buried in the Labor Department's monthly jobs report released Friday:  The number of people who said they were working part-time for lack of full-time positions continued to decline in September  -- from 7.27 million to 7.1 million -- while full-time jobs increased by a  273,000.

That left a not-inconsiderable number of people still struggling to pay their bills with a part-time paycheck, yet it also meant that the majority of jobs added by private employers last month were full-time positions.
“If you look over last year, we’ve seen far more full-time job creation than part-time,” Eric Lascelles, chief economist for RBC Global Asset Management, told the International Business Times. “We’re now back clearly to a narrative of job creation that understates the quality of jobs.”
The strong monthly report from the Labor Department eased concerns about the vigor of the expansion that has followed the Great Recession, when the unemployment rate reached 10 percent. The latest report specifically muted concerns of weakening that had been provoked by a disappointing report for August.
Indeed, the September report came with a positive revision to August's data: In place of the 142,000 net jobs the government initially said were added in August, the revised number came in Friday at a more robust 180,000.
The report “paints a pretty picture of the continued improvement in the labor market,” Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said. “The monthly numbers have been choppy in 2014 because the bad winter early in the year and then a bounce back in job growth as the economy thawed, but the underlying pace of job creation has been stronger than in 2013 and 2012.”
Job gains appeared broadly distributed through the economy in September. Professional and business services added a net 81,000 jobs, and retail saw an increase of 35,000 jobs. Health care -- a reliable source of paychecks even during the recession -- saw a net increase of 23,000 jobs. Food and beverage stores gained 20,000, though many were employees returning to work after strikes in August at a grocery chain in New England.
The most hopeful sign was perhaps the gains among full-time workers. In the five years since the recession ended in June 2009, the economy has seen more than 500,000 full-time jobs replaced by 800,000 part-time positions, the highest increase in part-time employment since 1993. Economists saw in September's jobs report potential evidence that this trend may be reversing, in what many take as the beginnings of a recovery strong enough to add more money to households that have been grappling with smaller paychecks.
“The recovery hasn’t necessarily always been impressive, but it’s been sustaining itself for some time now,” Mark Hamrick, chief economist for Bankrate.com, said. “The quality of jobs being added has been improving.”
The number of Americans working jobs for which they’re overqualified remains higher than it would be in a truly healthy economy, economists say.  People who are working have generally failed to see wage increases that keep pace with rising costs for crucial goods like housing, health care, education and gasoline -- a trend that has been in place for nearly a decade.
And even some of the seemingly good news gave way, upon closer examination, to a more sobering reality. Part of the reason the unemployment rate declined is that more people simply gave up looking for jobs. The so-called labor force participation rate -- a number that tracks who is working along with those unemployed but seeking jobs --  fell to 62.7 percent in September, a level not seen since 1978.
But against that backdrop, economists pointed to the increase in full-time work as a possible indicator of an economy that is finally beginning to spread its spoils to a greater share of American workers.
“Even when you factor in the decline in labor force, there’s a declining unemployment rate,” Lascelles said. “You could argue we’re halfway back to a normal full-time, part-time composition."" "
547,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2014 05:24PM ET</span>","U.S. hiring accelerates, jobless rate hits six-year low ","By Jason Lange 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers ramped up hiring in September and the jobless rate fell to a six-year low, bolstering bets the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates in mid-2015. 
Friday's report on employment is the most significant gauge of the economy's health ahead of Nov. 4 congressional elections. 
While President Barack Obama's message of an improving economy has been hampered by weakness in wages that persisted through last month, the data nevertheless underscored the strides the labor market has made this year. 
U.S. non-farm payrolls rose by 248,000 last month and the jobless rate fell two-tenths of a point to 5.9 percent, the lowest since July 2008, the Labor Department said. 
""Today's jobs report shows, at long last, what employment growth looks like in a balanced economic expansion,"" said Robert Shapiro, an economist at Sonecon. 
The data was generally stronger than Wall Street analysts had anticipated, and investors doubled down on bets the Fed will raise interest rates in mid-2015. The central bank has kept benchmark rates near zero since 2008 to encourage investment and hiring. 
Most of Wall Street's top bond firms still see the Federal Reserve starting to raise interest rates no later than June of next year and said the bond market was under-pricing the risk that the U.S. central bank may move more aggressively once it starts tightening policy, a Reuters survey showed on Friday. 
Still, analysts noted the report bore a large caveat in the form of persistently stagnant wages. Average hourly earnings actually slipped a penny last month. 
MOMENTUM GROWING 
While weak wage growth is keeping Fed policymakers cautious about the timing of their first rate hike, the pace of hiring has stepped up significantly this year. The gain in payrolls over the last six months was the strongest for any six-month period since before the 2007-09 recession. 
In a further sign of strength, 69,000 more jobs were created in July and August than previously estimated. 
U.S. stocks rose and yields on U.S. government debt moved up, while the dollar continued a rally that has been in place for weeks. 
The employment gains last month were broad-based. 
Factories payrolls, which had fallen in August, expanded by 4,000 workers. The retail sector added 35,300 jobs, a big bounce back that the government said reflected an end to employment disruptions at a grocery chain in New England. 
Construction and healthcare payrolls also notched solid gains. 
There were some downsides, even outside the weakness in wages. 
Notably, part of the decline in the unemployment rate was because workers left the labor force. The share of the population with jobs or hunting for one fell to 62.7 percent, its lowest level since 1978. 
That rate has declined in recent years as more workers have retired and as people have given up job hunts due to a weak economy. 
Still, a measure of unemployment that partially takes into account worker discouragement fell to 11.8 percent, its lowest level since October 2008. 
The number of people who held part-time jobs but wanted full-time work declined slightly to 7.1 million, a sign of slow progress that will be eyed closely by Fed officials as they seek to gauge how much slack remains in the labor market. 
In a sign the economy's expansion is moderating from the second quarter's torrid pace, a separate report showed growth in the U.S. services sector eased in September. 
Most economists see the economy growing at around a 3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from the 4.6 percent rate notched in the April-June quarter but still well above the average over the last two years of 2.2 percent. 
Recent signs of vigor in the economy, however, may be insufficient for the Fed to initiate an early rate increase. 
Over the past 12 months, hourly earnings were up only 2.0 percent, in line with what has been seen over the past few years and a slight deceleration from August. 
""It was a good report but I don't think it changes the Fed dynamics,"" said Kim Rupert, a managing director at Action Economics in San Francisco. ""I still think the first rate hike is maybe mid-year."" 
In a third report, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade gap unexpectedly narrowed in August to its smallest level in seven months on an increase in exports, which led some economists to raise their growth forecasts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, a sign the labor market may be tightening. 
Still, other data on Thursday showed weaker factory orders in August even after stripping out volatile transportation figures, a darker signal for future growth in manufacturing. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 287,000 in the week ended Sept. 27, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a rise in new claims. 
Claims have fallen steadily since the nation emerged from the 2007-09 recession and are currently lower than they were before the country's economic crisis began. Indeed, the current level is only 8,000 above the 14-year low reached in July. 
Thursday's data is ""consistent with the continued, solid performance in the labor market,"" said Keith Hembre, chief economist at Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis. 
The claims data will have no bearing on Friday's government report on monthly employment during September because the hiring survey was conducted earlier in the month. Economists expect companies stepped up the pace of hiring last month, adding 215,000 workers to payrolls. 
Separate data showed U.S. small businesses hiring workers at the fastest pace in eight months, further evidence of strength in the labor market. 
The National Federation of Independent Business said its monthly survey of its members found they added an average of 0.24 workers per firm last month, on a seasonally adjusted basis. 
The four-week moving average of jobless claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,250 to 294,750, just above an 8-1/2 year low hit in early August. 
The Labor Department said there were no special factors influencing the state level data. 
U.S. stock prices were flat, holding at levels reached in a Wednesday slump that was sparked by news that a patient was diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. 
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed new orders for U.S. factory goods posted their biggest decline on record in August, although the 10.1 percent drop was payback for an aircraft-driven jump a month earlier. 
Stripping out transportation orders which were depressed by a plunge in the volatile aircraft component, new orders were down a more modest 0.1 percent. 

The U.S. manufacturing sector continues to expand, although growth may be moderating. The Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday that its gauge of factory activity showed slower growth in September.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday new orders for manufactured goods dropped 10.1 percent. That was the largest drop in records going back to 1992.
Stripping out transportation orders which were depressed bya plunge in the volatile aircraft component, new orders were
down a more modest 0.1 percent.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast total new orders received by factories would decline 9.3 percent.
The U.S. manufacturing sector continues to expand, although growth may be moderating. The Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday that its gauge of factory activity showed slower growth in September.
In August, orders for transportation equipment dropped 42.2 percent, a development already made clear in the government's report on durable goods orders released on Sept 25. In July, aircraft manufacturer Boeing (N:BA) had reported outsized orders, making the decline in August unsurprising.
The Commerce Department revised slightly lower its estimate for growth in orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft during August. However, the department also said July's slight drop in this gauge, which is seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans, was smaller than previously estimated.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Growth in U.S. factory activity slowed more than expected in September even as hiring in the private sector accelerated, signs of an uneven expansion in the U.S. economy. 
The Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday its index of national factory activity dropped to 56.6 last month, its lowest level since June, from 59.0 in August. Economists had forecast it would slide to just 58.5. 
A gauge of new orders fell to 60.0 from 66.7. 
Analysts have warned that U.S. factories could feel a chill from soft demand in the global economy and from recent strength in the dollar, and the ISM data could be a harbinger. 
Still, gauges of U.S. manufacturing activity remain historically strong, with the ISM index still comfortably above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction - a sign the economy is still moving forward with strength. 
Analysts believe U.S. gross domestic product is growing much more quickly than its 2.2 percent average over the last two years, and the data did little to knock that view. 
""It still looks as though overall GDP growth in the third quarter was around 3.5 percent,"" said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics in London.U.S. Treasury yields fell as data from the United States, Europe and Asia all showed factory activity faltering, while stocks extended losses and the dollar slipped. 
The slowdown in U.S. factory growth followed an August reading that was the strongest since March 2011, leading some analysts to downplay the significance. ""Whether this month is a turning point is still to be seen,"" said Pierre Ellis, an economist at Decision Economics in New York 
A separate report from major payrolls processor ADP showed U.S. private employers added 213,000 jobs in September, just above economists' expectations. 
""Job gains remain strong and steady,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which co-developed the report. 
The ADP figures come ahead of the government's more comprehensive payrolls report due on Friday, which includes both public and private-sector employment. That report is expected to show the economy added 215,000 jobs last month. 
A third report on Wednesday showed U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in August, hit by weaker private spending outside the housing sector and a pullback in public investments. 
The decline led forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers to trim its estimate of third-quarter GDP growth by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.0 percent annual pace. Morgan Stanley cut its forecast to 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent. 

""Homebuilding activity has shown decent growth in recent months, but business and government construction have turned lower after surging in the spring following winter weather disruptions,"" Morgan Stanley economist Ted Wieseman said in a research note.

582,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2014 11:47AM ET</span>","Weak demand hits factory activity across Asia, Europe","By Sumanta Dey and Wayne Cole 
BANGALORE/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dwindling demand hurt factory activity across much of Asia and Europe in September, and mixed manufacturing indicators in the Americas on Wednesday raised the chances of slower global economic growth in the months ahead. 
China's manufacturing sector barely expanded, while Britain's slumped, and the drop in new orders did not even spare Germany, the strongest member of the euro zone currency bloc, or France, its No. 2 economy. 
Euro zone factories' final September purchasing managers' index from private data vendor Markit was 50.3, down from 50.7 in August, and its lowest reading since July last year, as new orders contracted for the first time in more than a year. 
""It is very hard to put any positive spin on the September PMI survey and contracting new orders do not bode well for manufacturing output in the fourth quarter,"" said IHS Global Insight economist, Howard Archer. 
While the European Central Bank (ECB) is unlikely to move interest rates at its meeting Thursday in the wake of slow eurozone economic growth, President Mario Draghi is expected to announce details of the ECB's asset-backed securities purchase program. 
But the clamor is growing louder for the bank to conduct full-blown quantitative easing (QE), involving buying sovereign bonds - as Britain, Japan and the United States have done - to thwart risks of deflation and revive growth. 
Economists gave a 40-percent probability of such a move in a Reuters poll last week. [ECB/INT] 
""We suspect that there is still appreciable reluctance within the ECB's Governing Council to engage in full blown QE, so it will only occur if the euro zone returns to recession and consumer price inflation trends down further,"" Archer said. 
WIDESPREAD SLOWING 
In Germany, factory activity shrank for the first time in 15 months in September, suggesting the engine of the euro zone economy may be running out of steam. In France, the sector contracted for the fifth month running. 
France defied its European Union partners on Wednesday with a 2015 budget setting out how it would bring its borrowing back to within EU limits two years later than promised, a retreat it blamed on a fragile economy. 
In Britain, manufacturing grew at the slowest rate in 17 months in September as demand weakened at home and in Europe, a factor likely to be noted by the Bank of England next week as it assesses how soon it should start raising interest rates. 
The downturn extended to Asia, with China's official PMI of activity staying stuck at 51.1 in September, only modestly above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction. 
China cut mortgage rates and downpayment levels this week for some home buyers for the first time since the global financial crisis, escalating efforts to boost an economy threatened by the sagging housing market. 
In India, factory activity expanded at its most sluggish pace this year in September on slowing new orders and output growth, while in South Korea, manufacturing activity shrank, fueling doubts over the strength of its economic recovery. 
With manufacturers worldwide struggling, demand fears sent oil prices to their lowest in more than two years this week, iron ore a five-year trough and copper a four-month low - all likely to intensify disinflation risks in Asia and Europe. 
MIXED DATA IN THE AMERICAS 
The U.S. manufacturing industry expanded in September, though at a slower pace than in August, while employment in the sector grew at its best pace since March 2012, according to financial data vendor Markit on Wednesday. 
Markit's final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for September slipped to 57.5 last month from 57.9 in August. 
""The September PMI reading, in fact, rounds off the strongest quarter recorded by the survey since the financial crisis, narrowly beating the previous peak seen when the economy was rebounding from recession in the second quarter of 2010,"" Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said. 
""GDP looks set to grow by at least 3.0 percent in the third quarter, with good momentum being sustained as we move into the final quarter of the year,"" he said. 
An alternative gauge of U.S. manufacturing from the Institute of Supply Management also showed the pace of growth slowing in September. 
Expansion in the Canadian manufacturing sector slowed in September, too, with a Markit/RBC PMI index reading of 53.5, pulling back from the nine-month high of 54.8 seen in August. 
In Mexico, factory activity expanded at a faster pace though with the Markit/HSBC PMI index rising to an eight-month high, in a sign that Latin America's No. 2 economy could pick up speed. 
Mexico exports mostly manufactured goods and sends nearly 80 percent of its exports to the United States. Analysts expect the economy to expand by about 2.5 percent this year, with growth picking up after a weak start to the year. 
However, in Latin America's No. 1 economy, Brazil's manufacturing activity contracted in September for the fifth time in six months as a limping economy and uncertainty over Sunday's presidential election led businesses to put off purchases of new capital goods, the Markit/HSBC survey showed. 

The HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index for the Brazilian manufacturing sector BRPMIM=ECI fell to a seasonally adjusted 49.3 in September from 50.2 in August.

outside the housing sector and a pullback in public investments.
Construction spending dropped 0.8 percent to an annual rate of $960.96 billion, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday in a report that also revised downward spending estimates for the
prior two months.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending increasing 0.5 percent in August.
The surprise decline was largely due to a 1.4 percent drop in money spent on private nonresidential construction, although outlays fell across the board with state and local construction
down 0.9 percent. The declines, however, came after a month in which spending in most construction categories had posted strong gains.

Private spending on housing fell only 0.l percent in August, which is unlikely to unmoor expectations of an ongoing recovery in the housing market.

Financial data firm Markit said its final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index turned down to 57.5 last month from 57.9 during August. The preliminary read for the index was 57.9. 
A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity. 
""The September PMI reading in fact rounds off the strongest quarter recorded by the survey since the financial crisis, narrowly beating the previous peak seen when the economy was rebounding from recession in the second quarter of 2010,"" Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said. 
The output subindex also turned down to 59.6 in September from 60.7 during August, while the employment component rose to 56.4 from August's final read of 54.6. 
""The labor market upswing clearly bodes well for overall non-farm payroll growth to rise above 200,000 in September,"" Williamson said. 
""Recent months have also seen a welcome revival in export growth, suggesting trade should also help boost the U.S. economy in the third quarter,"" he said. ""GDP looks set to grow by at least 3.0 percent in the third quarter, with good momentum being sustained as we move into the final quarter of the year."" 

A read on new orders turned down modestly last month from August, Markit said.

598,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2014 12:44AM ET</span>",China September factory activity steadies but economic outlook still weak,"By Koh Gui Qing 
BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector held up in September but remained subdued in a sign that the world's second-largest economy is still struggling to recover its growth momentum. 
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) hovered at 51.1, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, indicating a modest expansion in activity and a touch ahead of forecasts for a 51.0 reading. 
The data came a day after China cut mortgage rates for the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis to boost its flagging economy, and reinforced a view among some analysts that sluggish domestic demand and a cooling property market were dragging on activity. 
""We see the risk of third-quarter gross domestic product growth slowing to 7 percent"" from 7.5 percent in the second quarter, economists at ANZ Bank said in a note to clients, noting that growth in China's crude steel output fell to the year's low in the first 20 days of September. 
""Weakness in the property market and rising credit risks in the commodity sector will continue to weigh on the economy,"" the ANZ economists said. 
Unsteady - albeit strengthening - export sales, softening domestic investment and the property slowdown have all dragged China's economy through a rough year, leading investors to bet on further policy loosening by authorities to lift growth. 
Wednesday's PMI survey, which is biased towards large, state-owned factories, showed that demand for goods produced by such manufacturers was stronger in China than abroad, even though the trend is softening. 
The new orders sub-index, a proxy for foreign and domestic demand, stood at 52.2, down slightly from 52.5 in August but well above the 50-point mark that demarcates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. 
The new export orders sub-index, on the other hand, edged up to 50.2 but stood only a whisker above 50. 
""The economy still faces a degree of downward pressure,"" Chen Zhongtao, an official at the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing which helps to publish the PMI, said in a statement. 
""The data has only stopped falling this month and turned flat,"" Chen said. 
SLOWER GROWTH 
To arrest the economic cooldown, China's central bank and banking regulator relaxed lending rules for second-home buyers on Tuesday by giving them a 30 percent discount on mortgage rates and cutting their downpayment levels to 30 percent from 60-70 percent. 
But some analysts warned that a glut of unsold or unoccupied homes could temper any rebound in China's housing market, which accounts for about 15 percent of the economy. Others said it remained unclear if buyers would be persuaded by lower rates if they believed prices would continue to fall. 
The sagging housing market has pushed the Chinese economy into a deeper funk in recent months as weak activity appeared to broaden across sectors. 
Factory output and a broad measure of credit supply both unexpectedly fell to six-year lows in the summer. Profits at Chinese industrial firms fell 0.6 percent in August from a year ago, reversing from a near 14 percent rise the month before. 
And perhaps more worrying for policymakers, who prize a healthy labor market above all else in a downturn, a separate preliminary PMI survey by HSBC/Markit that was out earlier this month showed factory employment sinking to a 5-1/2-year low in September. 
Wednesday's official PMI showed factory employment shrank again in September, though the pace did not intensify, leaving the employment sub-index unchanged at 48.2. 
China's government is aiming to grow the economy by around 7.5 percent in 2014, though the run of underwhelming data so far this year has led many analysts to predict that growth would fall short of that target. 
Chinese policymakers have on their part maintained that no dramatic policy loosening is imminent because the country cannot rely on stubbornly loose credit conditions to bolster growth. 
Yet at the same time, policymakers have taken pains to ensure monetary conditions are easy and have rolled out a series of modest support measures aimed at the most vulnerable sectors of the economy. 
In September alone, the central bank disbursed 500 billion yuan ($81.5 billion) worth of three-month loans to China's top five banks to prevent short-term interest rates from spiking before this week's Golden Week holiday. That was followed by the first cut in mortgage rates since the global financial crisis. 
""We maintain our below-consensus gross domestic product growth forecasts (of) 7.2 percent in 2014 and 6.9 percent in 2015,"" Jian Chang and Rahul Bajoria, economists at Barclays Bank, said in a note.

616,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 30, 2014 05:45AM ET</span>",UK Clocks Strong Growth In Q2,"By Reuters - Britain's economy is bigger than previously estimated and stood at 2.7 percent above its pre-crisis peak at the end of the second quarter, according to new official figures on Tuesday.
The data from the Office for National Statistics, which reflect new methods of calculating gross domestic product (GDP), and showed Britain's economic output exceeded its peak before the 2008-09 recession in the third quarter of 2013.
Previously, it was thought Britain achieved this only in the second quarter of this year, when it was estimated to have exceeded the peak by just 0.2 percent.
The new estimates are part of European Union-wide changes to national accounts designed to better measure the size and scope of its economies, coupled with other adjustments made by the ONS.
The data are likely to be welcomed by the Conservative-led government ahead of a national election next year, although it showed they showed the economy grew 1.7 percent in 2013 -unchanged from the previous estimate.
The ONS also said Britain's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.9 percent on the quarter in the three months from April to June this year, a slight increase from 0.8 percent.
That compared with 0.7 percent growth in the first quarter, a slight downward revision from 0.8 percent previously reported.
GDP was 3.2 percent higher than in the second quarter of 2013.
Output in Britain's services industry expanded 1.1 percent in the second quarter, the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2011. Construction was revised up sharply to show 0.7 percent growth, compared with a previous estimate of no growth.
Economists had expected both rates to remain unrevised to show a 0.8 percent rise on the quarter and 3.2 percent on the year.
The new methodology includes major changes such as treating corporate research as output rather than a cost, as well as some more eye-catching additions - like estimates of the activity of prostitutes and drug dealers.
Recent business surveys suggest the momentum behind Britain's swift economic recovery will carry through to the final months of this year.
British consumer morale edged down this month, albeit only slightly from a recent nine-year high, a survey from researchers GfK showed on Tuesday.
The Bank of England forecasts that Britain's economy will grow by 3.5 percent this year, which would be its best rate of growth in around a decade, given recent downward revisions to growth in the run-up to the financial crisis.
BoE policymakers are keen to see the recovery broaden from consumption and into investment - a key signal that the upturn will be sustainable in the long-term.

The ONS figures showed business investment rose 11.0 percent on the year during the second quarter, and 3.3 percent from April to June alone.
An ONS official said the growth rates were affected by the inclusion of research and development as an investment rather than consumption.
Household spending rose a quarterly 0.6 percent and real disposable income rose by 2.2 percent on the quarter from the previous three months. The savings ratio rose to 6.7 percent from 5.7 percent in the first three months of 2014.
The ONS revised Britain's budget deficit excluding banks for the 2013/14 fiscal year to 5.7 percent of GDP, compared with 7.2 in the previous year.
Public sector debt as a percentage of GDP, excluding banks, is now estimated at 79.1 percent, compared with 76.5 percent in July under the old methodology.
The ONS also released second-quarter current account data, which showed that Britain's deficit with the rest of the world widened to 23.1 billion pounds from 20.5 billion in first three months of 2014. That was equivalent to 5.2 percent of GDP, up from 4.7 percent in the first quarter.
Economists had expected the current account gap to narrow to 17 billion pounds.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2014 02:43AM ET</span>",China final Sept HSBC PMI steady on firmer global demand but risks remain,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's vast factory sector showed signs of steadying in September as export orders climbed, a private survey showed on Tuesday, easing fears of a hard landing but pointing to a still-sluggish economy facing considerable risks.
The final HSBC/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index(PMI) hovered at 50.2 in September, unchanged from the August reading which was a three-month low, but lower than a preliminary reading of 50.5.
A sub-index measuring new export orders, a gauge of external demand, expanded to a 4-1/2-year-high of 54.5, though domestic demand appeared soft. The 50 mark separates expansion from contraction in activity on a monthly basis.
More worrisome, the survey showed further weakness in the job market, with the sub-index for manufacturing employment shrinking for the 11th consecutive month, which is bound to concern China's Communist leaders.
The world's second-largest economy has stumbled this year as a slowdown in the housing market further weighs on softening domestic demand.
With the property market expected to cool further, economists believe policymakers will have to roll out more stimulus measures in coming months to meet the government's 2014 growth target of around 7.5 percent.
""Overall, the data in September suggests that manufacturing activity continues to expand at a slow pace,"" said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC.
""We think the risks to growth are still on the downside and warrant more accommodative monetary as well as fiscal policies.""
Despite the strong surge in export orders, the overall output level fell to its lowest in four months, but managed to hold above the 50-point level.
Shares in Shanghai (SSEC) gave up modest early gains and dipped into the red after the report.
WEAK DOMESTIC ECONOMY
Despite a run of weak economic readings, Chinese leaders have said repeatedly that no dramatic change in policy is imminent.
Premier Li Keqiang said earlier this month that China cannot rely on loose credit to lift its economy and would continue to make only ""targeted adjustments"" to boost activity.
The official PMI is focused on larger factories that belong to the government, as opposed to the HSBC/Markit PMI survey which is biased towards smaller manufacturers in the private sector.
Smaller firms are facing greater financial stresses as some cash-strapped customers are taking longer to pay their bills. Smaller companies are also having more trouble getting credit as banks grow more cautious in the face of mounting bad loans and fears of defaults.
The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (HK:1398) (SS:601398), the country's biggest bank, said 80 percent of new non-performing loans in the second quarter came from the manufacturing and wholesale sectors.
China's banking regulator said on Sunday it had issued revised internal control guidelines for banks to ensure that appropriate risk management controls are adopted, while increasing penalties for any violations.

Issuance of the guidelines came days after China's central bank began a targeted program to make available 500 billion yuan ($81.6 billion) in short-term funds to China's five biggest banks to help the economy by keeping borrowing costs affordable.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending accelerated in August, the government said on Monday, a positive sign for an economy that appears to be firing on nearly all cylinders. 
The housing sector remains an exception, however, with a separate report showing Americans signed fewer contracts in August to purchase previously owned homes. 
Nevertheless, the rise in household spending offered the latest suggestion that years of exceptionally low interest rates have finally pushed the economy into a higher gear. 
Consumer spending rose 0.5 percent last month after being unchanged in July, the Commerce Department said. The growth in August was just above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. 
Millan Mulraine, an economist at TD Securities in New York called the data ""a further signal that the positive momentum in domestic activity is being sustained."" 
Even after adjusting for inflation, spending was 0.5 percent higher, the biggest gain since March. Growth in personal income ticked up 0.3 percent, in line with forecasts. 
Some of the strength in spending came from a decrease in the saving rate, which eased back from a 1-1/2-year high in July. 
On Wall Street, housing shares (HGX) fell even more than the broader stock indexes, which were down sharply as investors focused attention on civil unrest in Hong Kong. 
INFLATION MUTED 
Most investors are betting the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next year to keep inflation in check, although Monday's data gave little sign of growing price pressures. 
The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation was up 1.5 percent in August from a year earlier, down slightly from the reading in July, the Commerce Department data showed. A measure of underlying price pressures which strips out food and energy held at 1.5 percent. That reading had dipped to 1.2 percent earlier this year. 
Some policymakers at the U.S. central bank remain concerned that inflation appears stuck well below their 2 percent target. 
Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans repeated on Monday his argument that the Fed should be patient when it comes to raising rates. 
Data on Friday showed the economy grew at its fastest pace in 2-1/2 years in the second quarter. Still, the housing sector has struggled to recover from the 2007-09 recession when a home price bubble deflated. 
In August, contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes fell 1.0 percent, the National Association of Realtors said. 

The pending home sales index plunged last year after mortgage interest rates spiked, although it has been on a rising trend since this past March.

All major regions experienced declines except for the West, which rose for the fourth consecutive month, the report said.

Industrial companies made profits of 3.83 trillion yuan between January and August, 10 percent higher than the same period last year. China's National Bureau of Statistics did not give a reason for the August decline.
The monthly decline adds to recent weak figures that have fueled fears that China is at risk of a sharp slowdown if it does not make fresh stimulus measures.
China's factory output grew at its weakest pace in nearly six years in August while growth in other key sectors such as retail sales and imports also cooled.

China's economy has had a difficult time this year as a slowdown in the housing market weighs on economy activity. This was further exacerbated by unsteady foreign demand which dragged on exports, factory output and domestic investment.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2014 12:38PM ET</span>","Business spending, exports spur big bounce in U.S. economy","By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at its fastest pace in 2-1/2 years in the second quarter with all sectors contributing to the jump in output in a bullish signal for the remainder of the year.
The Commerce Department on Friday raised its estimate of growth in gross domestic product to a 4.6 percent annual rate from the 4.2 percent pace reported last month.
""It increases our confidence that strong growth is obtainable in the second half of this year,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.
The United States is bucking a spate of weaker overseas growth with the euro zone and Japan slumping, and growth in China slowing as well.
With the U.S. economy firing on nearly all cylinders, traders are bracing for an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve next year. The dollar , which got a lift from the GDP data, has risen about 7 percent against a basket of major currencies since early July in anticipation.
The data also supported stocks, which were up marginally near midday, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell.
A faster pace of business spending and sturdier export growth than previously estimated were the two main factors behind the upward revision to U.S. GDP, which had its best growth performance since the fourth quarter of 2011.
Consumer spending growth was unrevised at a 2.5 percent rate as stronger healthcare outlays were offset by weakness in spending on recreation, other services and durable goods.
Household spending, however, is likely to accelerate, with another report on Friday showing consumer sentiment hitting a 14-month high in September.
BRISK DOMESTIC DEMAND
But the expansion in consumer spending, combined with strong business investment, was nevertheless enough to push domestic demand ahead at its fastest pace since 2010.
That suggests the economy's recovery is becoming more durable after output slumped at a 2.1 percent rate in the first quarter because of an unusually cold winter.
So far, data covering manufacturing, trade and housing suggest that much of the second quarter's momentum spilled over into the third quarter. Growth estimates for the July-September quarter range as high as a 3.5 percent pace.
When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 5.2 percent pace during the second quarter, while corporate profits rose at their fastest pace in three years.
Business spending on equipment was raised to an 11.2 percent pace from a previously reported 10.7 percent rate. Businesses also invested more in nonresidential structures, such as gas drilling, as well as in research and development.
The trend likely persisted in the third quarter, with data on Thursday showing business orders for capital goods rose in August.
Though trade was a drag for a second consecutive quarter, export growth was raised to an 11.1 percent pace, the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2010, from a 10.1 percent rate.
The dollar's strength, however, could take some of the edge off of export growth in the months ahead.
""The recent appreciation in the dollar will continue and slow export growth in 2015 by driving relative prices for U.S. exports higher,"" said Doug Handler, chief economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts.

Businesses accumulated $84.8 billion worth of inventory in the second quarter, contributing 1.42 percentage points to GDP growth. The relatively strong pace could result in inventories making no contribution to growth in the third quarter.

651,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2014 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer sentiment ends at 14-month high in September,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment finished September at its strongest in more than a year on growing optimism about the economy and more favorable outlook on future income, a survey released on Friday showed.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final September reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment finished at 84.6, the highest since July 2013, up from 82.5 at the end of August.
The late September reading was unchanged from its initial figure and economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 84.7.
""The main factor promoting greater confidence in September was more favorable prospects for the domestic economy as well as more favorable personal income expectations,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
Curtin said the September index reading, which was the second highest in the last seven years, signals an acceleration in consumer spending in the next 12 months, which might grow at a 2.7 percent pace.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations ended at 75.4 in late September, also the highest since July 2013 on a final basis though it was a tad lower than preliminary reading of 75.6 reported earlier in this month. It was higher than the 71.3 reading in August and above a forecast of 75.0.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions was 98.9 in late September, compared with 98.5 seen earlier this month. It was lower than August's 99.8 and above a forecast of 98.0.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 3.0 percent from 3.2 percent and the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook was at 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent. The late September inflation readings were unchanged from their early September levels.

655,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2014 05:40AM ET</span>",China official PMI seen steady at 51.2 in September but pressures remain,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's manufacturing sector probably steadied in September as factory orders held up, a Reuters poll showed, providing some welcome relief for those who worry the Chinese economy is quickly losing steam.
The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)likely edged up slightly to 51.2 in September compared with August's 51.1, leaving it comfortably above the 50-point level demarcating an expansion from a contraction on a monthly basis.
That may assure investors that the world's second-biggest economy, which has stumbled this year, is not doing as badly as some feared. But at the same time, some analysts warned investors against thinking that growth would pick up markedly.
""It is good that it is above 50, but it is not that great,"" Li Haitao, an economist at Guangdong Development Bank, said in reference to the PMI. ""The trend has stayed weak.""
Hurt by unsteady exports, a housing downturn and cooling investment growth, the world's second-largest economy has wobbled this year, raising doubts about whether it can grow by around 7.5 percent in 2014 as targeted by Beijing or whether it may be at risk of a sharper slowdown.
That has prompted many investors to bet that Chinese policymakers may further loosen fiscal and monetary policies to stoke growth, following a raft of stimulus measures since spring.
Expectations that China would reduce the amount of deposits that banks must set aside as reserves, or the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), were bolstered earlier this month when data showed growth in factory output unexpectedly fell to a six-year low in August as the housing slowdown increasingly weighs on other parts of the economy.
But on their part, Chinese leaders have said repeatedly that no dramatic change in policy is imminent, partly because China cannot always rely on easy credit conditions to re-vitalise its economy, and partly because policymakers fear that flooding the system with money may feed speculative activities instead of going into the real economy.
Instead, policymakers said they would make ""targeted"" adjustments by loosening policy reins in the most vulnerable sectors. Some economists have interpreted that to mean that the central bank would prevent short-term interest rates from climbing too much.
The official PMI followed a similar preliminary survey by HSBC/Markit released earlier this week that showed the manufacturing sector gaining momentum in September, even though factory employment slumped to a 5-1/2-year low.
The official PMI is focused on larger factories that belong to the state, as opposed to the HSBC/Markit PMI which is biased towards smaller manufacturers in the private sector.
Smaller firms are facing greater financial stresses and are having trouble getting credit as banks grow more cautious in the face of mounting bad loans and fears of defaults. But a Reuters survey last week found that even many larger firms are relying on heavy state subsidies to keep them in the black.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2014 12:13PM ET</span>","U.S. business spending plans, jobs data support growth outlook","By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for capital goods by U.S. businesses rebounded in August, pointing to underlying strength in the economy.
The economic outlook also got a lift from other data on Thursday showing only a marginal increase in the number of people filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week.
""This is supportive of the U.S. economy continuing to expand at a healthy pace in the second half of the year,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The Commerce Department said non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6 percent. Orders for the so-called core capital goods orders fell by a revised 0.2 percent in July.
Last month's increase was in line with expectations. Core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 0.7 percent in July.
While orders for long-lasting manufactured goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell a record 18.2 percent, that was payback for an aircraft-driven jump in July.
Durable goods orders increased 22.5 percent in July, the largest gain since the government started tracking the series in 1992, as civilian aircraft orders soared 315.6 percent. Orders for the volatile transportation category declined 42.0 percent last month as aircraft orders tumbled 74.3 percent.
Boeing (N:BA) reported on its website that it had received 107 orders last month, a third of July's outsized gains. Automobile orders fell 6.4 percent following a 10.0 percent increase the prior month.
The underlying trend in new orders, however, is up and further gains are likely in the months ahead.
A manufacturing survey early this month showed a measure of new orders jumped to a near 10-1/2-year high in August and businesses showed an increased appetite for capital spending.
JOBS MARKET FIRMING
In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 for the week ended Sept. 20.
That was below economists' forecasts for a rise to 300,000 and left the four-week average of claims down 1,250 at 298,500. Claims are near their pre-recession levels, a sign that the labor market is firming despite August's cooling in job growth.
""The claims data continue to suggest that the slowing in payroll growth in August was an aberration that will likely either be revised higher or we will likely see some catch-up in the months ahead,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.
While a third report from information services firm Markit showed a slight ebbing in activity in the services industry this month, employment growth accelerated and the rate of backlog accumulation was the fastest since October 2009.
U.S. financial markets were mixed, with prices for U.S. government debt rising. U.S. shares were trading weaker, while the dollar was up against a basket of currencies.
The U.S. economy is bucking a slowing global economy, supported by firming consumer spending and increased business willingness to invest in equipment and capital projects.
Last month, shipments of core capital goods edged up 0.1 percent. The increase in July's shipments was, however, revised up to 1.9 percent from 1.5 percent. Shipments of these goods are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
""The third quarter is setting up to be one of the strongest for capital spending in a year or so,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York.
As a result, forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers raised its third-quarter growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.6 percent annual pace. BNP Paribas saw a 0.2 percentage point upside risk to its 3.0 percent rate forecast.
Unfilled orders for core capital goods increased 1.2 percent last month after rising 1.0 percent in July, a building up of backlogs that will keep the nation's factories busy for a while.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday durable goods orders, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, dropped 18.2 percent, the largest decline since the series started in 1992. That partially reversed July's aircraft-driven 22.5 percent surge.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast durable goods orders falling 18 percent last month after a previously reported 22.6 percent jump in July.
Orders for the volatile transportation category declined 42.0 percent last month as civilian aircraft orders tumbled 74.3 percent. Transportation orders had soared 315.6 percent in July.

A survey early this month showed a measure of new orders jumped to a near 10-1/2-year high in August and businesses showed an increased appetite for capital spending.
Manufacturing, one of the pillars of the economy, is being supported by firming domestic demand, which is helping to offset some of the weakness due to slowing growth in the euro zone and China.
Excluding transportation, durable goods orders rose 0.7 percent after falling 0.5 percent in July.
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 0.6 percent. The so-called core capital goods orders fell by a revised 0.2 percent in July, which was previously reported as a 0.7 percent decline.

Claims are hovering near their pre-recession levels, an indication that labor market conditions are tightening despite August's sharp slowdown in job growth.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. single-family homes surged in August to their highest level in more than six years, a sign the housing recovery remains on course. 
The recovery, however, will likely remain gradual against a backdrop of relatively high unemployment and sluggish wage growth, which are sidelining first-time buyers and keeping many young adults from seeking their own accommodation. 
""This is welcome news in an otherwise mixed outlook,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ""We are still a long way from the housing market recovering from the bust."" 
New home sales jumped 18.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000 units, a second straight monthly gain that took them to the highest level since May 2008, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. 
Though new home sales account for only about 9 percent of the market, the increase helped allay fears of renewed weakness after a surprise decline in home resales last month. 
""We expect some of this buoyancy to be reversed in the coming month, but continue to believe that the underlying fundamentals of the housing sector remain favorable,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, but housing shares tumbled after home builder KB Home (N:KBH) reported earnings that missed Wall Street's expectations. 
KB Home shares fell 5.7 percent, while Pulte Group (N:PHM) slipped 0.6 percent and Toll Brothers (N:TOL) dropped 0.9 percent. The overall housing market index (HGX), however, was up marginally in mid-afternoon, tracking broader indexes. 
CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT 
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday that sales of previously owned homes fell in August for the first time in four months as the investors who had been supporting the market stepped away. 
Economists hope their departure will leave an opening for first-time buyers, but worry still-high unemployment and sluggish wage growth will continue to constrain sales. 
The share of first-time buyers in the home resale market has been stuck around 29 percent, well below the 40 percent to 45 percent considered as ideal by economists and real estate agents. 
""It's still a challenging environment for those buyers,"" said Guy Berger, an economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut. ""You can make a good case for a slow, gradual improvement."" 
In a separate report, the Mortgage Bankers Association said applications for loans to purchase homes fell last week as mortgage rates crept up. New loan applications are well off peaks seen early last year. 
With average hourly earnings up only 2.1 percent over the past year, many Americans are opting to rent, while some of those who have recently graduated from college are moving back home or staying with friends, weighing on home sales. 
According to government data released last week, 492,000 households were formed last year, well below the one million economists say would be consistent with a healthy market. 
""Household formation, a major driver of new construction, is falling asleep at the wheel,"" said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. 
Despite the rise in sales in August, the stock of new houses on the market hit its highest level in four years, giving buyers more choices. 

At August's sales pace it would take 4.8 months to clear the supply of houses on the market, down from 5.6 months in July. A six months' supply is normally considered a healthy balance between supply and demand.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2014 10:10PM ET</span>","Japan September flash manufacturing PMI falls to 51.7, output at six-month high","TOKYO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Japanese manufacturing activity eased slightly in September but output rose at the fastest pace in six months, a preliminary survey showed on Wednesday, suggesting industrial production is stabilising after a sharp slump in demand following a sales tax increase in April.
The Markit/JMMA flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 51.7 in September from a final reading of 52.2 in August.
The index remained above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction for a fourth straight month.
The figures could ease fears that manufacturers would scale back production as stocks of unsold goods swelled after the tax hike.
The output component of the flash PMI index rose to 53.4 from a final 52.9 in August to reach the highest level in six months.
The index for inventories of finished goods eased slightly to 50.2 from a final 50.9 in August.
The new orders index eased slightly to 52.3 from a final 54.4 in August.
The index for new export orders also fell to a preliminary 52.2 in September from a final reading of 52.8 in the previous month.
Signs of rising factory output could help the economy recover from the shock of the sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent.
The tax increase dampened consumer spending more than many economists expected, triggering a sharp second-quarter contraction, and has taken some steam out of an expected third quarter rebound.
Japan's exports have also struggled to rise as companies shift production overseas, which robs the economy of an important growth engine.
Confidence at Japanese manufacturers fell the most in nearly two years in September, the monthly Reuters Tankan business confidence survey showed last week.
The report raised fresh doubts about the effectiveness of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan to reflate the economy, which hinges on a strong pick-up in both corporate and consumer spending.
The government will analyse data for July-September to decide whether to proceed with a second sales tax hike to 10 percent scheduled for late next year.
The tax increases are needed to pay for rising welfare spending, but some politicians worry they will do too much damage to the economy.

The final Markit/JMMA PMI for September will be released on Oct. 1.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2014 01:27PM ET</span>","Sturdy U.S. factory, services data bolster growth picture","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity hovered at a near 4-1/2-year high in September and factory employment surged, supporting views of sturdy economic growth this quarter. 
The economic picture was further brightened by other data on Tuesday showing an acceleration in factory and services industry growth in some areas of the country. Housing, however, continues to plod along, with home price gains decelerating sharply in July. 
""The rest of the economy continues to deliver the goods, but the housing market is still not performing as everybody thought it would and that's going to take some time,"" said Eugenio Aleman, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Financial data firm Markit said its preliminary or ""flash"" factory purchasing managers index came in at 57.9, unchanged from August when it touched its highest level since April 2010. 
Any reading above 50 signals expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity. 
Factory jobs rose for a second straight month, Markit said, with a gauge of labor market conditions touching its highest level since March 2012. A measure of new orders held steady above the 60 level for the third time in the past four months, indicating persistent demand for manufactured goods. 
Manufacturing activity in the third quarter was the strongest since Markit started tracking it in mid-2007. 
Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said its regional manufacturing index increased this month, with factories citing a rise in new orders and shipments. 
Firms in the region, which stretches along the Eastern seaboard from South Carolina to Maryland, also hired more employees and increased the average workweek, but there was some moderation in wage growth. 
""The healthy performance of manufacturing is not surprising ... and reflects the pick-up in broader economic activity, a trend that has emerged since the beginning of the second quarter,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. 
LIMITED EXPORT POTENTIAL 
Karydakis, however, cautioned that sluggish growth in the euro zone and some key emerging markets could limit the sector's export-oriented growth over the next few quarters. 
Data on Tuesday showed euro zone business activity in September was the weakest this year, while factory activity in China picked up only slightly. 
In contrast, the U.S. economy is poised for a brisk expansion in the third quarter, with estimates ranging as high as a 3.5 percent annual pace. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter. 
""We expect GDP to grow at an annualized rate of at least 3 percent and as much as 4 percent, depending to a large extent on how the vast services economy fared in September,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London. 
The services sector appears to have gotten off to a strong start in September. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its new general activity index for non-manufacturing firms in the mid-Atlantic region jumped sharply. 
The surge in activity reflected increases in new orders, sales and full-time hiring. Service sector employees also worked longer hours, while firms increased their capital spending. 
In a fourth report, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said home prices increased 4.4 percent in the 12 months through July, the smallest gain since September 2012. 

While the cooling price increases reflect a tepid house market recovery, they are expected to stimulate demand.

698,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2014 11:10AM ET</span>",Euro zone growth slows as Chinese factories trundle on,"By Jonathan Cable and Jake Spring LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Euro zone business growth dipped to a 2014 low in September as firms again cut prices, while factory activity in China picked up only slightly, surveys showed, keeping the spotlight on policymakers' plans for economic stimulus.
The data seems sure to dishearten the European Central Bank, struggling to spur growth and revive disconcertingly low inflation and whose head Mario Draghi again raised prospects on Monday of using extra unconventional measures if needed.
In China, signs of a weakening labor market reinforced expectations that authorities in Beijing would further relax financing conditions in coming weeks.
""The Chinese number beat expectations but it's not really going anywhere,"" said Peter Dixon, senior economist at Commerzbank. ""It's indicative of an economy that doesn't have a lot of momentum behind it. It's doing okay but we would be looking for a bit more strength.""
The HSBC/Markit Flash China PMI rose to 50.5 in September from August's final reading of 50.2. Economists polled by Reuters had expected factory growth to stall at 50.0, citing deteriorating business confidence and the growing drag from the cooling property market.
Markit's Eurozone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers' Index, based on surveys of thousands of companies across the region and seen as a good indicator of growth, dipped to a nine-month low of 52.3, shy of expectations in a Reuters poll for no change from August's 52.5.
INFLATION OUTLOOK POOR
The index has been above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction since July 2013.
But Markit said the latest survey pointed to third-quarter economic growth of just 0.3 percent - not enough to generate strong inflation.
""This survey does nothing to alter the picture of a struggling euro zone economy, intensifying the pressure on governments and the ECB to provide more policy support,"" said Jennifer McKeown, senior economist at Capital Economics.
Growth ground to a halt in the bloc in the last quarter as Germany's economy shrank and France's stagnated, and the ECB surprised markets earlier this month by cutting benchmark lending and deposit rates further and said it would buy asset-backed securities and covered bonds.
Notwithstanding Draghi's remarks on Monday, no more changes to policy are expected when the Governing Council meets next week. [ECILT/EU]
Consumer inflation in the 18 countries sharing the euro rose to just 0.4 percent year-on-year in August, slightly higher than July's 0.3 percent but staying so far below the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling that it was not enough to radically alter the outlook.
According to the PMIs, firms cut prices again this month - although not as steeply as they did in August. The composite output price index rose to 49.2 from 48.9 but has now been below the 50-mark for a full 2-1/2 years and the discounting may still not be paying off.
The manufacturing PMI for Germany, Europe's largest economy, slumped to 50.3, its lowest reading since June 2013 and below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of 32 economists. Its services PMI however blew out the top end of forecasts.
A service industry PMI for France, the bloc's second-biggest economy, sank to 49.4 after just two months in growth territory.
""The German economy is still ticking along at a reasonable rate of growth but it's by no means impressive. The overall picture for France when you put this all together is another quarter of stagnation at best,"" Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist said.
JOB LOSS
Shares were on course for a third day of losses on Tuesday after the downbeat European data, though the Chinese factory survey gave commodities a break from recent selling.
""We still expect some more measures (from Beijing authorities) to support growth, such as stimulating infrastructure investment, relaxing property market policies and some more monetary easing steps,"" said Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS in Hong Kong.
Bets against overt policy easing are in line with remarks by senior leaders including Finance Minister Lou Jiwei, who said over the weekend that China would not dramatically alter its policy based on any one indicator.
But the government's promises to desist from ramping up credit supply are increasingly being tested by a run of data showing that the world's second-biggest economy is sliding into a deeper slowdown.
Tuesday's PMI showed a measure of employment shed more than a point to drop to 46.9, its lowest since February 2009 during the global financial crisis, when a collapse in exports threw tens of millions of Chinese out of work.
A hefty drop in employment could raise alarm bells for the government, which has indicated it will tolerate slower economic growth below 7.5 percent for the year as long as employment is not affected.

""The reading is still weak and we believe that the economy has shifted toward 7 percent year-on-year growth,"" Credit Agricole economists said in a note to clients.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2014 02:37PM ET</span>","U.S. existing home sales fall, investors pulling back","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home resales unexpectedly fell in August as investors stepped away from the market, but the decline probably does not signal renewed weakness. 
The National Association of Realtors said on Monday existing home sales dropped 1.8 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. The decrease was the first in four months, although the sales pace was still the second highest for the year. 
""There is no fundamental economic weakness story in the fall. Maybe investors are leaving the market because home prices are too high and (there are) no more bargains to be had,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
Economists had forecast sales increasing to a 5.20 million-unit pace. Compared to August last year, sales were down 5.3 percent. 
Investors had propped up the market by snapping up distressed properties and converting them into rental units. But last month they accounted for only 12 percent of transactions, which was the smallest share since November 2009. 
Although first-time buyers did not step up in August, the retreat by investors means fewer bidding wars and increased opportunities for ordinary buyers that could support sales going forward. In addition, a strengthening labor market is likely to culminate in faster wage growth, bolstering potential buyers. 
Equities investors were not heartened, however. Housing shares fell on the data, underperforming the broader market. PulteGroup (N:PHM) dropped 2.12 percent, while KB Home (N:KBH) fell 2.48 percent and Toll Brothers (N:TOL) declined 2.27 percent. The dollar was little moved against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt were higher. 
CHANGING PROFILE 
""This report indicates an orderly rotation in the distribution of the buyers' profile from investors to first-time homebuyers, which we believe is a first crucial test of the sustainability of the housing recovery,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
A survey last week showed homebuilder sentiment hit its highest level in nearly nine years in September, with builders reporting a sharp pick-up in buyer traffic. Lennar Corp (N:LEN), the nation's second-largest homebuilder, said its orders jumped 23 percent in the latest quarter. 
The report on previously owned home sales showed all cash sales made up 23 percent of transactions in August, the smallest proportion since December 2009. 
The share accounted for by distressed properties - foreclosures and short-sales - was the smallest since the Realtors group started tracking the series six years ago. 
First-time buyers accounted for 29 percent of sales, well below the 40 percent to 45 percent that is considered by economists and real estate agents as ideal. 
The inventory of unsold homes on the market increased 4.5 percent from a year-ago to 2.31 million in August. 
At August's sales pace, it would take 5.5 months to clear houses from the market, unchanged from July. A six months' supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. 
The improving supply is restraining price increases. The median home price increased 4.8 percent from a year ago, slowing from the double-digit growth seen for much of 2013. 

Slower price gains and a leveling off in mortgage rates from their peak last year should help support sales.

The research organization's monthly Leading Economic Index inched up 0.2 percent, after an upwardly revised 1.1 percent increase in July.
Economists polled by Reuters predicted that the index would rise 0.4 percent after July's earlier reported 0.9 percent increase.
The slower-than-expected pace of growth last month, the report said, was driven by dismal applications for housing permits and new orders for non-defense capital goods.
""The leading indicators point to an economy that is continuing to gain traction, but most likely won't repeat its stellar second-quarter performance in the second half,"" said Ken Goldstein, economist at The Conference Board.
The Coincident Economic Index, a measure of current economic activity, continued to expand, ""amid improving personal income, employment and retail sales,"" he added. ""However, industrial production registered a slight decrease for the first time in seven months.""
Analysts expect the U.S. economy to gain traction in the second half of this year after the economy was hurt earlier by harsh winter conditions that put a damper on economic activity across the board.

727,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2014 12:32PM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims data point to firming labor market,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting a sharp slowdown in job growth in August was an aberration. 
While other data on Thursday showed some weakness in home building and factory activity, the underlying trend remained supportive of solid economic growth in the third quarter. 
""We have broad-based growth in the economy, including the housing market,"" said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 36,000 to a seasonally adjusted 280,000 for the week ended Sept. 13, the lowest level since July, the Labor Department said. 
Economists had forecast claims falling to only 305,000. The data came a day after the Federal Reserve renewed a pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a ""considerable time,"" while hinting at a faster pace of rate hikes than the U.S. central bank was signaling a few months ago. 
""This is consistent with that the Federal Reserve is expecting to see,"" Faucher said of the data. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 14.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 956,000-unit annual pace last month. But July's starts were revised to show a 1.12-million unit rate, the highest level since November 2007. 
Construction permits also fell, but that too followed a sizable gain in July, and the decline in both starts and permits were centered in the volatile multi-family homes segment. 
In a bright spot, starts on single-family homes in the South, where about half of U.S. single-family construction takes place, rose to an eight-month high, while permits in the region touched their highest level since April 2008. 
The jobless claims data helped pushed the dollar to a more than six-year high against the yen, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the S&P 500 brushing against resistance at a record peak. The housing index underperformed the broad market as Pulte Group and DR Horton slipped. 
HOUSING RECOVERY ON TRACK 
The housing sector is clawing back after suffering a setback from a spike in mortgage rates last year, but it remains constrained by relatively high unemployment and stringent lending practices by financial institutions. 
With the labor market gaining traction, however, economists expect an acceleration in housing activity. 
""The underlying momentum in the housing sector remains quite favorable and we expect building activity to rebound next month,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
In another report, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its index of mid-Atlantic business activity slipped in September. 
Despite the drop, factory employment in the region hit its highest level since May 2011 and new orders accelerated, showing underlying strength in one of the major pillars of the economy. 
The jobless claims data covered the period during which employers were surveyed by the government for its tally of non-farm payroll employment. 
Claims fell 19,000 between the August and September survey periods, suggesting a rebound in job growth from August's eight-month low. 
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 63,000 to 2.43 million in the week ended Sept. 6. That was the lowest level since May 2007. 

The unemployment rate for people receiving jobless aid fell to 1.8 percent, the lowest level since November 2006, from 1.9 percent in the prior week. That, together with the shrinking jobless rolls, indicated more people are finding work.

742,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2014 09:17PM ET</span>","Japan exports knocked by weak U.S. shipments, hurt economic recovery","By Stanley White TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports declined in August as shipments to the United States contracted, another sign the economy is struggling to rev up after a deep slump in April-June.
A further period of lackluster exports and slack domestic demand could force the government and the Bank of Japan to find new ways to prop up the economy.
Exports fell 1.3 percent in August from a year ago, less than the median estimate for a 2.6 percent annual decline. That followed a 3.9 percent annual gain in the previous month after having fallen in June and May.
The patchy performance has dashed hopes that external demand can offset a consumer spending slump caused by an April sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent, heaping pressure on policymakers to do more to spur economic growth.
""The U.S. economy is recovering, so things should not be this bad,"" said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
""The data do reflect a shift in production overseas. I don't think monetary policy easing is needed, but there are doubts about how the overall economy will perform in the third quarter.""
Japan's economy shrank an annualized 7.1 percent in the second quarter hit by the tax hike, the biggest contraction since the 2009 global financial crisis.
Underperforming exports have been one of the weak links in the Japanese economy, which is struggling to cope with the April tax hike.
Confidence at Japanese manufacturers fell the most in nearly two years in September as a tax increase hit the economy harder than expected, a Reuters poll showed, suggesting further difficulty for the struggling recovery.
The worsening sentiment in the monthly Reuters Tankan, with only a feeble improvement forecast for December, bodes ill for the Bank of Japan's quarterly tankan survey, which had been forecast to rebound in the third quarter.
In the latest month, exports were hit by a decline in shipments to the United States - down 4.4 percent on-year, from a 2.1 percent rise in July.
Weak exports, frailty in business confidence and a shaky outlook could raise the pressure in coming months on the BOJ to ease policy further, and complicate Abe's decision on whether to raise the national sales tax again.
Imports fell an annual 1.5 percent in August, more than the median forecast for a 1.2 percent annual decline, as energy imports declined.
As a result, the trade deficit stood at 948.5 billion yen, less than the median estimate of 1.0289 trillion yen.
Japan's trade balance was in deficit for the 26th month in a row, an indication that its status as an export powerhouse has faded as companies shift production offshore.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said the nation is on track to meet the central bank's 2 percent inflation goal, but the deep economic contraction has raised questions about the outlook for growth.
A shallower rebound in the third quarter could further heighten speculation for additional BOJ stimulus, analysts say.

Exports have failed to pick up despite the yen's decline to a six-year low, partly as many Japanese firms have shifted their production sites overseas which tempers the benefit of a softer currency.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices fell for the first time in nearly 1-1/2 years in August and underlying inflation pressures were muted, which could lessen the urgency for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. 
The Labor Department said on Wednesday its Consumer Price Index dropped 0.2 percent last month as a broad decline in energy prices offset increases in food and shelter costs. 
It was the first decrease since April last year and followed a modest 0.1 percent gain in July. Economists had expected consumer prices would be flat in August. 
""There is still enough slack in the economy to keep a tight lid on price increases, which should support the view of those within the Fed arguing in favor of patience before the first rate hike,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. 
The Fed, at the end of the two-day policy meeting, on Wednesday renewed a pledge to keep interest rates near zero for a ""considerable time"". However, it issued projections that suggested the U.S. central bank might raise borrowing costs a bit quicker than it had been thinking a few months ago. 
Concerns at the Fed that inflation was running too low have abated in recent months, but the CPI data suggested an acceleration of prices during the spring may have run its course. 
The CPI increased 1.7 percent in the 12 months through August, the smallest advance in five months, while a core index that strips out food and energy prices was up by the same amount, marking a slowdown from July's 1.9 percent gain. 
Month-on-month, the core index was unchanged for the first time since October 2010. The Fed targets 2 percent inflation and tracks an index that is running even lower than the CPI. 
Many economists think the central bank could raise interest rates as soon as next June, while interest rate futures point to July for the first rate hike. It has kept benchmark overnight lending rates near zero since December 2008. 
WAGE GROWTH SLUGGISH 
The dollar rallied against a basket of currencies on perceptions of a faster pace of rate hikes, touching its highest level since July last year. Prices for U.S. government debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose marginally. 
While the economy appears to be on sustainable growth path, anemic wage growth is dampening price pressures. Average hourly earnings adjusted for inflation rose 0.4 percent in August. Even so, they have risen only by that same amount over the past year. 
A second report showed homebuilder sentiment hit a near nine-year high in September, with builders reporting a sharp pickup in buyer traffic since early summer. The surge in confidence underscores the economy's firming fundamentals. 
The upbeat housing report, and better-than-expected earnings from homebuilder Lennar Corp (N:LEN), pushed up housing stocks, which were solidly outperforming the broader market. The S&P homebuilding index <.SPLRCHOME> was up 3.65 percent. 
""While an inflationary surge is not in the offing, with the economy continuing to recover in the second half, there is a better than even chance for a modest acceleration in inflation,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG in New York.In August, energy prices fell for a second straight month, recording their biggest decline since March 2013. There were broad declines in energy prices, with the cost of gasoline falling by the most since April last year. 
Food prices rose 0.2 percent after advancing 0.4 percent in July as the effects of a drought in California lingered. 
A second straight month of sharp declines in airline fares dampened the core CPI. Falling apparel and used car prices also weighed. Recreation prices recorded their largest drop since December 2009, while household furnishings declined and college tuition and fees saw their biggest fall in almost 27 years. 

While rents increased, the pace moderated a bit from July. Prices for alcoholic beverages posted their largest increase since January 2007.

Earnings rose an average 0.4 percent in August from July, adjusted for prices, the largest one-month increase since November 2012. Wages also rose 0.4 percent from a year ago.
“August was a better month for real income growth,” said Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Group. “But wage growth remains a little disappointing.”
Consistent year-over-year growth of above 1 percent would be healthy, but the economy hasn’t seen that kind of growth since the 1990’s, he said.

Meanwhile, prices fell 0.2 percent last month, the Labor Department said, primarily because food prices increased a mere 0.2 percent and gasoline prices fell 4 percent as tensions in the Middle East and Russia eased somewhat. Small upticks in rent prices and new car prices were offset by a nearly 5 percent drop in airfare. Core prices, which exclude food and energy prices, didn’t rise at all for the first time in four years.
The latest data will ease pressure on the Federal Reserve, which will announce its policy Wednesday afternoon, to raise interest rates sooner rather than later next year."

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the current account gap, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, fell to $98.51 billion from a revised $102.11 billion shortfall in the first quarter.
That was the smallest gap since the fourth quarter of 2013.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the deficit widening to $114.0 billion from a previously reported $111.2 billion shortfall in the first three months of the year.
A large equity disinvestment resulted in an outflow of $121.71 billion in the first quarter, which the government at that time described as an ""atypical"" occurrence.
There was a partial reversal in the second quarter, with foreign direct investment inflows increasing $72.01 billion.
The current account deficit represents 2.3 percent of gross domestic product, down from 2.4 percent in the first quarter.
The current account deficit has been gradually shrinking, hitting a 14-year low in the fourth quarter of 2013, helped in part by declining petroleum imports as the nation reduces its dependency on foreign oil.
In the second quarter, goods exports increased 2.3 percent to $408.81 billion. Imports, however, rose 2.8 percent to $597.97 billion.
The surplus on primary income increased to $53.1 billion in the second quarter from $52.4 billion in the first quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices were flat in August, pointing to muted inflation pressures that should allow the Federal Reserve to bide its time as it considers when to raise interest rates. 
The Labor Department said on Tuesday falling gasoline and food prices restrained its producer price index for final demand last month. Prices received by the nation's farms, factories and refineries had edged up 0.1 percent in July. 
""The Fed has more time to allow monetary policy to work its way through the economy before feeling the need to raise rates,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. 
Economists had expected producer prices to gain 0.1 percent last month. In the 12 months through August, they increased 1.8 percent, accelerating a bit from the 1.7 percent rise in the year through July. 
The report came as Fed officials gathered for two-day policy meeting. They have held benchmark rates near zero since late 2008, but are seen inching toward an increase around the middle of next year. 
Data on retail sales, manufacturing, the services sector and housing have indicated the economy is on a firm growth path, although a quarterly survey of U.S. chief executive officers released on Tuesday showed they had grown gloomier on plans for hiring and more wary about sales prospects. 
Despite the mostly upbeat readings on the economy's health, the tame reading on producer prices suggested the U.S. central bank need not rush to remove its monetary stimulus. 
""If (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen is looking for evidence of slack in the economy, and thinking that inflation is too low, then PPI final demand prices fill the bill this morning,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as traders took to the sidelines to await the Fed's policy statement on Wednesday. 
The PPI last month was dampened by a 1.4 percent decline in gasoline prices, which followed a 2.1 percent fall in July. Food prices slipped 0.5 percent after rising 0.4 percent a month earlier. 
Easing wholesale food and gasoline prices could tame consumer prices over the coming months. 
The Labor Department will on Wednesday release August consumer prices data, with economists expecting prices to hold steady on a month-on-month basis after nudging up 0.1 percent in July. 
The producer prices report showed prices received for services at the final demand level increased 0.3 percent after rising 0.1 percent in July. A 1.7 percent surge in prices for loan services accounted for more than 20 percent of last month's increase. 
Producer prices excluding food and energy ticked up 0.1 percent, slowing from a 0.2 percent gain in July. In the 12 months through August, the core PPI for final demand advanced 1.8 percent. It had increased 1.6 percent in July. 

A broader measure, which excludes food, energy and trade services, increased 0.2 percent for a third straight month. It was up 1.8 percent compared to a year ago.

Month-over-month, consumer price inflation inched up 0.4% in August, in line with forecasts.
Core CPI, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco costs rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.9% last month, up from 1.8% in July. Analysts had expected core prices to rise 1.8% in August.
The retail price index increased 2.4% in August, meeting expectations and down from 2.5% in July.
The data also showed that the house prices index climbed 11.7% in July, compared to forecasts for a reading of 10.6% and following a 10.2% increase in June.
GBP/USD was trading at 1.6173 from around 1.6170 ahead of the release of the data, while EUR/GBP was at 0.8003 from 0.8004 earlier.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2014 12:00AM ET</span>",China August FDI falls to lowest in at least two-and-a-half years,"By Xiaoyi Shao and Koh Gui Qing BEIJING (Reuters) - China's foreign direct investment inflows in August fell to a low not seen in at least 2-1/2 years, underscoring the challenges to growth facing the world's second-biggest economy.
The weak investment data comes as China's economic growth appears to be hitting a soft patch after a bounce in June, with indicators ranging from imports to industrial output and investment all pointing to sluggish activity.
China attracted $7.2 billion in foreign direct investment in August, the Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday, down 14 percent from a year earlier and at a level not seen since February 2012.
That left China with $78.3 billion of FDI in the first eight months of 2014, down 1.8 percent from a year earlier.
FDI is an important gauge of the health of the external economy, to which China's vast factory sector is oriented, but it is a small contributor to overall capital flows compared with exports, which were worth about $2 trillion in 2013.
But even China's exports are at risk of slowing from uncertainties in global demand. China's trade ministry spokesman Shen Danyang said on Tuesday exports may not be able to sustain high growth in the months to come although the country's trade situation was stabilizing.
FDI inflows in China have maintained steady growth every year since the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Inflows reached a record high of $118 billion in 2013.
In the first eight months of the year, China's services sector attracted $43.3 billion of FDI, up 8.9 percent from a year ago and faring much better than the manufacturing industry, where FDI dropped 15.7 percent from a year ago to $27.5 billion.
Among the 10 countries that are the biggest sources of China's FDI, investment from South Korea surged 31.3 percent on an annual basis and that from Britain leapt 18.9 percent.
In contrast, investment from Japan plunged 43.3 percent from a year earlier while FDI from the United States and European Union dropped between 17-18 percent each.

China's non-financial direct outbound investment rose 15.3 percent in the first eight months from a year earlier to $65.2 billion.

772,By Investing.com,"<span>Sep 15, 2014 09:53PM ET</span>",RBA September board meeting minutes highlight house price rise risks,"Investing.com - The following full-text of the minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Reserve Bank Board on Sept. 2 was released on Tuesday.Members PresentGlenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury), Heather Ridout AO, Catherine TannaOthers PresentGuy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Malcolm Edey (Assistant Governor, Financial System), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Luci Ellis (Head, Financial Stability Department), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary)International Economic ConditionsMembers began their discussion by noting that the pace of growth of Australia's major trading partners had continued to be around its long-run average over the past year.Recent data for China were consistent with GDP growth at around the authorities' target of 7.5 per cent. The growth rates of industrial production and retail sales had remained fairly steady, while the growth of fixed asset investment had declined a little further. The manufacturing PMI for August had declined to around the average level of recent years. Conditions in the Chinese residential property market continued to weaken and members observed that these developments – and their potential to spill over to broader activity and the financial system – remained a risk to the outlook for China. They noted that there was scope for further adjustments to policy settings by the authorities if needed, as well as the potential for tension between the objectives of maintaining economic growth at close to its current pace and placing growth in financing on a more sustainable footing.The modest easing of growth of Australia's trading partners in the June quarter had largely reflected the contraction of output in Japan, which had been expected following the consumption tax increase in April. Members noted that more timely measures of conditions had generally picked up a little, but it was too early to judge the likely pace of growth over the second half of this year. The economies of east Asia overall had been growing at around the rate of recent years, while the United States had recorded a strong rebound in growth in the June quarter. In contrast, economic activity in Europe remained weak, with real GDP in the euro area unchanged in the June quarter and the unemployment rate falling only gradually. Inflation had declined further and remained well below the target of the European Central Bank (ECB) of below but close to 2 per cent.Commodity prices overall had declined a little over the past month. The price of iron ore had fallen to around its recent lows while coal prices were little changed, following sharp declines earlier in the year.Domestic Economic ConditionsMembers began their discussion of the domestic economy by considering developments in the labour market. Overall, conditions remained subdued. The recorded unemployment rate increased to 6.4 per cent in July. This was concerning, though members noted that interpretation of this increase had been clouded by significant measurement issues and that other labour market indicators suggested conditions had not deteriorated to the extent implied by the increase in the unemployment rate. While employment growth had moderated somewhat in recent months, employment remained about 1 per cent higher over the past year and forward-looking indicators of labour demand had been improving modestly since late last year. Members noted that forecasts of a period of below-trend growth in economic activity meant that it would be some time before the unemployment rate declined consistently.Members observed that the degree of spare capacity in the labour market was apparent in the slow growth of wages. The wage price index for the June quarter indicated that annual wage growth had remained around the slowest pace seen in the 17-year history of the series. Business surveys and information from liaison with firms suggested that wage growth in the private sector was likely to remain contained at around its recent pace over coming quarters.Members noted that the June quarter national accounts were scheduled to be released the day after the meeting. GDP growth was expected to have slowed from the strong growth recorded in the March quarter, with export volumes declining following the very strong growth in the March quarter. Domestic demand was likely to have been supported by further growth in dwelling investment and moderate consumption growth.A number of indicators – including retail sales and measures of consumer confidence – suggested that household consumption had increased moderately in the June quarter. More recently, the value of retail sales had picked up in the month of June and measures of consumer confidence had rebounded to around average levels. Information from liaison with firms suggested that the value of retail sales had increased over July and August.Members noted that dwelling investment had expanded further in the June quarter and that leading indicators pointed to continued growth in the months ahead. For new dwellings, loan approvals and first home owner grants had increased strongly over the year and dwelling approvals remained at a high level despite having declined a little since late last year. At the same time, a wide range of indicators showed that conditions in the established housing market continued to strengthen. In particular, housing prices had been rising at a rapid pace and auction clearance rates were above average levels. Housing credit had continued to grow at an annualised pace of around 7 per cent, with investor credit a particularly strong component.Recent data suggested that business investment had been little changed in the June quarter. For the non-mining sector, the ABS survey of firms' capital expenditure intentions had been revised slightly higher and continued to imply modest growth in non-mining business investment over the course of 2014/15. Members noted that survey measures of business conditions and confidence continued to improve across non-mining industries and were now above their average levels. While mining investment was estimated to have been little changed in the June quarter, it was expected to decline significantly over the next year or so, consistent with what had been indicated for some time by liaison contacts.Financial MarketsMembers commenced their discussion of financial markets with the observation that conditions remained similar to the previous month. Markets continued to be characterised by low volatility despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and uncertainty about the timing of the first interest rate increase in the United States.The ECB left policy rates unchanged at its August meeting and planned to conduct its first targeted longer-term refinancing operation later in September, which was expected to see the ECB balance sheet expand again.Major sovereign bond yields fell over the month, with yields on 10-year German Bunds falling below 1 per cent for the first time on record and yields on two-year bonds again falling to below zero. Members noted that the recent fall in yields on Bunds had reflected a fall in inflation expectations rather than in real yields, as had been the case previously. US 10-year bond yields declined to their lowest levels since mid 2013.Yields on Australian government bonds also declined over the past month, as the falls recorded early in August after the release of the labour force data for July were only partially unwound following an improvement in measures of business and consumer confidence.Global equity prices were generally little changed over the past month, although the US market had reached new highs. The Australian equity market had also shown little net change over the past month, with company earnings announcements broadly in line with expectations.Conditions in foreign exchange markets, including for the Australian dollar, had remained quiet over August, with volatility remaining at low levels.Members noted that Australian banks continued to raise funds relatively cheaply, with a recent issue of residential mortgage-backed securities being of record size in the domestic market and occurring at the tightest pricing since the financial crisis. Reflecting lower funding costs and competitive pressures, rates on Australian intermediaries' housing loans continued to edge down in August. The average interest rate on all outstanding housing loans had fallen by around 15 basis points since the cash rate was reduced in August 2013.Members concluded their discussion of financial markets by noting that market pricing was for the cash rate to be unchanged at the September meeting and for the next year at least.Financial StabilityMembers were briefed on the Bank's half-yearly assessment of the financial system.Volatility in global financial markets remained low, as did the extra return that investors earned for bearing risk. Investors had been seeking higher yields in a range of markets. Members noted that a sudden change in risk assessment could lead to a sharp repricing of assets and could also disrupt the gradual improvement in conditions that had occurred in the major banking systems overseas. Potential triggers for such a reappraisal included revised expectations for the path of interest rates in advanced economies. In contrast, credit and geopolitical events over recent months that might have been expected to affect investor risk appetite had caused little reaction in market prices.Large banks in most major economies had made progress in repairing their balance sheets, but this had been hampered by low profitability, which had resulted from weak economic conditions and, in some cases, fines for past misconduct. Asset performance remained especially weak in the euro area. In contrast, credit and property prices had been growing strongly in some emerging economies, including China until recently, which had made these economies more sensitive to adverse shocks.Members noted that Australian banks continued to report improving asset performance and strong profits, which had contributed to further increases in their capital ratios. Australian banks and non-banks had both benefited from easier wholesale funding conditions globally. This in turn had encouraged stronger competition in lending for housing and to large businesses, but members noted that this had not, to date, led to a general easing in mortgage lending standards and policies. For investors in housing, the pick-up in housing credit growth had been more pronounced than for owner-occupiers, with investor demand particularly strong in Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne.Members further observed that additional speculative demand could amplify the property price cycle and increase the potential for property prices to fall later. The main risks in such a scenario would likely be to the stability of the macroeconomy rather than the financial system, particularly if households were to react to declines in their wealth by cutting back on their spending. Members were also updated on some of the recent actions by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in this area.Members noted that commercial property markets in Australia had also been quite buoyant recently. Australian property had been yielding higher rental returns than were available overseas, which had attracted strong demand from both local and foreign investors. This had boosted prices even though rents for some types of commercial property had declined. In contrast, demand for finance from other parts of the business sector remained subdued, although business credit growth had picked up a little in recent months.Members were briefed on recent international regulatory developments, as well as on the Financial System Inquiry Interim Report and the Bank's supplementary submission to the Inquiry.Considerations for Monetary PolicyThe outlook for Australia's major trading partners was little changed from the previous meeting, with growth expected to be a little above average in both 2014 and 2015. Commodity prices remained at historically high levels, although iron ore prices had declined noticeably over the past month. Global financial conditions remained very accommodative, with long-term interest rates falling further over the month and volatility and risk spreads remaining at low levels.Domestically, GDP growth was expected to have eased in the June quarter following the strong outturn in the March quarter. Exports had declined and although mining investment was expected to have been little changed in the June quarter, it was set to decline noticeably over the next year or so. At the same time, measures of business conditions had improved and there was evidence suggesting that growth in non-mining business investment would pick up modestly over the coming quarters.Labour market conditions had remained subdued, with recent data indicating a degree of spare capacity. Wage growth had remained low and it was likely that it would be some time before the unemployment rate declined on a sustained basis.Members noted that the current setting of monetary policy was accommodative. Interest rates remained very low and had declined a little for borrowers since the cash rate was last changed. Investors continued to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments and were accepting more risk in doing so. Credit growth had picked up, including to businesses. Credit growth for investor housing was running at around 10 per cent per annum. Housing prices were continuing to increase in the larger cities and members considered that the risks associated with this trend warranted ongoing close observation. On the other hand, the exchange rate remained above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the declines in key commodity prices and, overall, had offered less assistance to date than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy.Accommodative monetary policy was supporting demand in some sectors of the economy, but policy also needed to be cognisant of the risks to future growth that could accompany a large further build-up in asset prices, particularly if that was associated with an increase in leverage. Members judged that the current stance of monetary policy continued to be appropriate and was contributing to sustainable growth and inflation outcomes consistent with the target over the period ahead. Members considered that the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.The DecisionThe Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 15, 2014 11:17AM ET</span>",Autos weigh on U.S. factory output; outlook still upbeat,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output fell for the first time in seven months in August, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a steadily expanding factory sector. 
That view was bolstered by other data on Monday showing factory activity in New York state jumped to its highest level in nearly five years in September. 
""The weakness in factory output in August is likely to be transitory,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Factory production dropped 0.4 percent last month as motor vehicle production fell sharply after surging in July, the Federal Reserve said. The drop, which followed a gain of 0.7 percent in July, confounded economists' expectations for a 0.3 percent rise. 
Excluding automobiles, manufacturing output gained 0.1 percent in August. So far in the third quarter, factory production is running at a 4.6 percent annual pace, a sign that manufacturing will continue to support economic growth. 
Motor vehicle output declined 7.6 percent last month after a 9.3 percent jump in July. Economists attributed the surge in July to difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations after some automakers kept assembly lines running instead of closing plants for the traditional summer retooling. 
With auto sales at a 8-1/2 year high, motor vehicle production is expected to rebound. 
In a separate report, the New York Federal Reserve Bank said its Empire State general business conditions index soared to 27.54 this month, the highest reading since October 2009, from 14.69 in August. 
A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's factory activity. A gauge of new orders rose last month and inventories continued to shrink, keeping the balance between orders and inventories favorable. 
GROWING STRONGLY 
""If we can be persuaded to look though the volatility of the official data, it's evident that the U.S. economy has continued to grow strongly in the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London. 
Third-quarter growth estimates range as high as a 3.5 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 4.2 percent in the second quarter. 
With the economic data, including retail sales and housing, continuing to be upbeat, analysts say that could result in a hawkish tilt in the Fed's statement when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday. 
""Investors will have to start getting used to the reality that the Fed is going to raise interest rates, most likely during the first half of next year,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
The dollar was trading higher against the euro and the British pound, while U.S. stocks were mixed. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose. 
Mining output increased 0.5 percent in August, while utilities production rebounded 1.0 percent. 
That helped to cushion the drag from manufacturing, leaving overall industrial production falling only 0.1 percent in August. 

The amount of manufacturing capacity in use fell to 77.2 percent last month from 77.6 percent in July, while overall industrial capacity use hit a six-month low of 78.8 percent.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2014 05:40AM ET</span>","China August factory growth slows to near six-year low, calls grow for more stimulus","By Kevin Yao BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory output grew at the weakest pace in nearly six years in August while growth in other key sectors also cooled, raising fears the world's second-largest economy may be at risk of a sharp slowdown unless Beijing takes fresh stimulus measures.
The output data, combined with weaker readings in retail sales, investment and imports, pointed to a further loss of momentum as the cooling housing market increasingly drags on other sectors from cement to steel and saps consumer confidence.
Industrial output rose 6.9 percent in August from a year earlier - the lowest since 2008 when the economy was buffeted by the global financial crisis - compared with expectations for 8.8 percent and slowing sharply from 9.0 percent in July.
""The August data may point to a hard landing. The extent of the growth slowdown in the third quarter won't be small,"" said Xu Gao, chief economist at Everbright Securities in Beijing.
""The chances of cutting interest rates and bank reserve requirements have increased. I think they are more likely to cut interest rates.""
Some analysts believe annual economic growth may be sliding towards 7 percent in the third quarter, putting the government's full-year target of around 7.5 percent in jeopardy unless it takes more aggressive action. Experts reckon output growth of around 9 percent would be needed to attain such a goal.
""Short of outright policy easing, China will likely miss the 7.5 percent growth target this year, and a sharp economic slowdown will endanger the undergoing structural reforms,"" Liu Li-Gang and Zhou Hao at ANZ wrote in a note.
""As such, we reckon that Chinese authorities should further relax monetary policy as soon as possible to prevent growth momentum from decelerating further.""
Reinforcing the tepid economic activity, China's power generation declined for the first time in four years, falling 2.2 percent in August from a year earlier, and pointing to slackening demand from major industrial users.
Jiang Yuan, a senior statistician with the bureau, said the dip in August factory growth was due to weak global demand, especially from emerging markets, and the slowdown in the property sector that hit demand for steel, cement and vehicles.
China's economy got off to a weak start this year as first-quarter growth cooled to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent. Beijing responded with a flurry of stimulus measures that pushed the pace up slightly to 7.5 percent in the second quarter, but soft July and August data suggest the boost from those steps is rapidly waning.
""The government must take forceful policy measures to stabilize growth,"" said Li Huiyong, an analyst at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai.
HARD LANDING?
Other activity indicators for August were also mostly weaker than expected.
Retail sales climbed 11.9 percent, lagging forecasts of 12.1 percent and July's 12.2 percent, with growth in car sales in particular off sharply, suggesting consumers are more cautious.
Carmaker BYD Co Ltd, backed by billionaire Warren Buffett, recently warned profit may fall by as much as a fifth in the first nine months of the year.
Fixed-asset investment, an important driver of economic activity, grew 16.5 percent in the first eight months from the same period last year, lower than forecasts. Economists polled by Reuters had expected 16.9 percent growth, slowing from 17.0 percent in Jan-July.
Much of the broader decline appears linked to the slowdown in the property market, which is intensifying.
Property investment data also released on Saturday showed further declines in sales and new construction, while growth in sales of housing-related goods such as home appliances, furniture and building materials all slowed.
Mortgage issuance in the first eight months fell 4.5 percent from a year earlier, worse than a 3.7 percent drop in January-July. Some would-be buyers have complained of long delays in getting loans as banks grow more cautious, while others may be holding off in anticipation of further price declines.
Data on Friday showed that credit levels in China appeared to improve in August after an alarming drop in July, but remained below average. Bad loans are on the rise and banks expect more to go sour as the economy slows.
That followed trade data that showed China's exports were buoyant but import growth unexpectedly fell for the second consecutive month in August, posting its worst performance in over a year.
STEADY EMPLOYMENT COULD TEMPER BEIJING'S RESPONSE
While most analysts expect Beijing to unveil more steps in coming months in order to meet its 2014 growth target, the room for policy loosening is seen as limited after past stimulus programs left local governments saddled with piles of debt and fueled rampant speculation, especially in the housing market.
Bolder action now, such as an interest rate cut, may only result in more money going into speculative and potentially destabilizing activity rather the real economy, some analysts have noted.
The last time China suffered a ""hard landing"" was during the height of the global crisis, when economic growth tumbled to 6.6 percent in early 2009. That is far short of the near collapses which loomed over some developed economies, but still threw tens of millions of Chinese out of work, alarming the Communist Party's stability-obsessed leaders into action.
Despite slower growth, the economy still created 9.7 million new jobs in the first eight months of 2014, a rise of over 100,000 from the same period last year, said Guo Tongxin, another statistician at the bureau, trying to play down the significance of the dismal August indicators.
""It's normal to see fluctuations in some indicators. Currently, the employment and price situation remains generally stable (and) structural adjustments continue to make progress,"" Guo said in a statement.

Premier Li Keqiang said on Monday that China cannot rely on loose credit to lift its economy, and reassured a business forum that Beijing would continue to roll out modest ""targeted"" measures as policymakers look to shore up growth.

796,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2014 01:17PM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales move higher; consumer spirits rise,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales rose broadly in August and consumer sentiment hit a 14-month high in September, supporting expectations for sturdy economic growth in the third quarter.
The data on Friday helped ease concerns about soft consumer spending, which had lagged other fairly upbeat economic data covering manufacturing, services and housing. Several big Wall Street firms bumped up their GDP growth forecasts on the news.
""It is further indication that the underlying positive momentum in the U.S. economy is being sustained,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Commerce Department said retail sales, which account for a third of consumer spending, increased 0.6 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in July, as Americans stepped up purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods.
The only decline was at gasoline stations, but that reflected declining prices at the pump that should free up income to support spending in the months ahead.
In a sign of underlying strength, so-called core sales increased 0.4 percent in August. Core retail sales exclude purchases of automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, and correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.
Separately, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 84.6 in early September, the highest reading since July 2013, from 82.5 in August. A gauge of income expectations hit its highest level since November 2008.
A third report showed only a modest increase in business inventories in July, suggesting restocking would not provide a boost to growth in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent pace in the second quarter.
U.S. Treasury debt prices fell, while the dollar held near a six-year high against the yen on the data. U.S. stocks were trading lower as a new round of U.S. sanctions against Russia hit energy shares.
GROWTH ESTIMATES LIFTED
August's increase in core retail sales followed an upwardly revised 0.4 percent gain in July that helped put them 4.1 percent above their year-ago level. While that remains below a pre-recession pace of about 5.5 percent, it nevertheless bodes well for economic growth.
Macroeconomic Advisers raised its third-quarter GDP growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.3 percent annual rate, as did Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast to a 3.5 percent rate from 3.4 percent.
Economists said it was not clear whether the recent raft of positive data would prompt the Federal Reserve next week to signal it was moving a bit closer to raising interest rates.
The Fed, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, has said it would likely wait a ""considerable time"" after ending a bond-buying program in October before hiking rates from near zero.
""Retail sales were still somewhat weaker in the third quarter and recent labor market indicators have been somewhat less encouraging in August and September,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.

""This may be enough to keep the doves at the Fed in wait-and-see mode,"" he said.

797,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 12, 2014 10:45AM ET</span>",US Retail Sales Rose Broadly In August,"By Meagan Clark - U.S. retail sales rose solidly in August which -- with an upward revision to July’s growth -- suggests that American consumer spending will continue to pick up this fall and into 2015.
Retail sales account for a third of consumer spending or about a fifth of the economy. The Commerce Department said Friday that retail sales increased 0.6 percent in August from July and 4.8 percent from a year ago as Americans bought cars and other goods, after a revised 0.3 percent gain in July from June. July’s retail sales were previously reported as flat.
“Consumers are not going hog wild, but they are responding to the better labor market by gradually increasing their spending,” said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group.

Factoring in inflation of about 2 percent, retail sales rose about an annualized 3 percent, roughly in line with economists’ expectations for the economy’s growth in the second half of the year.
Households spent 0.7 percent more on furniture and electronics from July and 0.9 percent more on leisure goods, as well as 0.3 percent more on clothing and 0.9 percent more on sporting goods, the Commerce data showed. That indicates Americans are confident enough in their finances to up their spending on discretionary items, said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics.
“Job gains, moderate wage growth, record-high stock prices, rising home values, low interest rates, easier access to credit, and a general improvement in consumer confidence will all support spending gains going forward,” Hoffman said.
Core retail sales, which exclude cars, gasoline, building materials and food services, increased 0.4 percent in August from July and 4.1 percent over the year. That’s still well short of pre-recession levels of about 5.5 percent.
“Wage growth is still fairly modest, even though unemployment is coming down,” said Jeremy Lawson, London-based chief economist of Standard Life Investments. “Someone’s total real income growth, that’s going to be the primary driver of retail sales.”
Still, ""it's a solid report"" with ""a solid amount of growth,"" he said."
798,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2014 10:10AM ET</span>","U.S. business inventories, sales rise in July","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. business inventories rose in July, but probably not enough to change views that stock accumulation could be a minor drag on economic growth in the third quarter.
The Commerce Department said on Friday inventories increased 0.4 percent after an unrevised 0.4 percent gain in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product changes, climbing 0.4 percent.
Retail inventories excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, rose 0.4 percent after increasing 0.3
percent in June. Inventories added 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth in the second quarter. Data on wholesale and manufacturing inventories released earlier this month suggested restocking would probably not contribute to growth in the third quarter.

In July, business sales rose 0.8 percent after increasing 0.6 percent in the prior month. At July's sales pace, it would take 1.29 months forbusinesses to clear shelves, unchanged from June.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary September reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 84.6, the highest since July 2013, up from 82.5 in the final August reading.
The number beat the median forecast of 83.3 among economists polled by Reuters.
""All of the early September gain was in the Expectations Index, while consumers judged current economic conditions slightly less favorably than in August,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
""Although consumers anticipated a slowdown in employment growth, (they) expected the highest rate of growth in their wages in six years.""
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations jumped to 75.6 from the 71.3 reading last month and above a forecast of 73.0.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions dipped to 98.5 from 99.8 and below a forecast of 100.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 3.0 percent from 3.2 percent and the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook was at 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent.

The Labor Department said on Friday import prices fell 0.9 percent last month after slipping 0.3 percent in July.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices declining 0.9 percent in August. In the 12 months through August, prices dropped 0.4 percent.
Sluggish global demand and a relatively strong dollar are dampening imported inflation.
That and sluggish wage growth have translated into fairly benign domestic price pressures, which should buy the U.S. Federal Reserve a bit more time to maintain its very accommodative monetary policy stance.
Imported petroleum prices declined 4.4 percent in August, the biggest drop since last November, after falling 1.7 percent the prior month. Imported food prices gained 0.6 percent after rising 1.1 percent in July.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2014 08:56AM ET</span>","U.S. jobless claims rise, but firming labor market trend intact","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, but that probably does not signal a material shift in labor market conditions as claims remain near their pre-recession levels. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 315,000 for the week ended Sept. 6, the highest level since late June, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims slipping to 300,000 last week. 
The period included the Labor Day holiday and claims tend to be volatile around holidays. A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the state level data. 
The four-week average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, edged up 750 to 304,000, not far from pre-recession levels and consistent with strengthening labor market conditions. 
Atlantic City casino closings could bump up claims in the coming weeks. 
U.S. Treasury debt prices held their modest gains, while the dollar and U.S. stock index futures were little moved by the data. 
Job growth braked sharply in August, with employers adding only 142,000 jobs to their payrolls - snapping six consecutive months of job increases above 200,000. 
Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the weakness, noting that payroll gains tend to be smaller in August because of difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations in hiring. 
In addition, other labor market indicators, including manufacturing and services sectors surveys have pointed to relatively strong job gains. 
The jobless claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid rose 9,000 to 2.49 million in the week ended Aug. 30, also not straying too far from pre-recession levels. 

The unemployment rate for people receiving unemployment benefits held at 1.9 percent for the ninth straight week.

832,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2014 11:48PM ET</span>","China August inflation cools in August, gives room for more stimulus","China's consumer inflation cooled more than expected in August, further evidence that the economy is losing momentum, but economists are divided over whether Beijing will use the extra room to announce fresh stimulus measures.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.0 percent in August from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday, missing market expectations for 2.2 percent and down from 2.3 percent in July.
The producer price index fell 1.2 percent, its 30th consecutive monthly decline, as weak economic conditions continue to rob Chinese companies of pricing power. The market had expected a 1.1 percent decline after a drop of 0.9 percent in July.
Highlighting faltering demand, China's second-biggest steelmaker, Baoshan Iron and Steel 600019.SS (Baosteel), said on Wednesday it will cut its prices for October delivery, which is normally a peak steel consumption period.
The CPI rose 0.2 percent in August from the previous month, only half as much as economists had expected.
With consumer inflation well below the official annual ceiling of 3.5 percent, the government and the central bank have scope to provide further stimulus to the economy if needed - but the question is whether pumping more money into the system will help the economy or hinder it.
""As China's inflation continues to trend down, we believe that the deflation risk is rising and China needs to further ease monetary policy,"" said Hao Zhou, economist at ANZ in Hong Kong, reflecting one common view.
""More importantly, the soft PPI inflation indicates that the real interest rates facing the corporates have even picked up amid the economic slowdown, which will likely squeeze their profit margins over time.""
But other economists think policymakers will wait and see if stimulus measures announced earlier in the year gain traction.
Bill Adams at PNC argued that low unemployment rates means that Beijing will not need to do much.
""Inflation is well-controlled, and the limited public data on labour market dynamics suggest continued low unemployment,"" he wrote in a research note, adding that signs of robust inflation in the prices for services such as tailoring and home repair reflect a strong employment rate.
""August data so far in hand - the CPI and PPI reports, PMIs, and trade data - hint that headline real GDP growth is picking up in the third quarter of 2014, and suggest a new round of government stimulus is unlikely in 2014.""
A flare-up in price pressures and debt levels following a massive stimulus programme during the global financial crisis remains fresh in policymakers' minds, so any measures now may continue to be tightly focussed on the most vulnerable sectors of the economy.
Beijing has been particularly concerned by signs that easing up on credit has inadvertently channelled cash into speculation and rate arbitrage in China's burgeoning shadow banking market, as opposed to lending for real economic activity.
Traders say the administrative crackdown on shadow banking has resulted in an environment in which short-term liquidity is technically plentiful, yet the willingness to lend is weak as banks see a spike in bad loans.
WIDER WEAKNESS
The key question for economists is assessing how weak China's economy actually is, accounting for seasonality and data distortions.
Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday that China cannot rely on loose credit to lift its economy and it would continue to make only ""targeted adjustments"". He said the economy can still grow by around 7.5 percent this year as earlier forecast by the government.
Trade data on Monday showed China's exports were buoyant but import growth unexpectedly fell for the second consecutive month in August, posting its worst performance in over a year.
That fuelled speculation about whether authorities should loosen policy further in a bid to revive cooling demand, which is being compounded by a weakening housing market.
Data on new lending, industrial output and retail sales will be announced in the next few days.
Since April, authorities have accelerated some infrastructure work, injected cash into banks to increase lending and relaxed controls in the housing market in a bid to boost flagging property sales.
Those steps have not had a clear impact on economic performance so far, but they do appear to have buttressed a stock market rally in mainland markets, which are heavily focussed on liquidity policy and on real estate.
Asian share markets were up slightly after the inflation data, with Japan's Nikkei at an 8-month high, while the Australian dollar rose. Chinese markets, which have been on a rally recently, rose mildly but appear to have already priced in expectations for mild inflation.

838,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2014 08:50PM ET</span>",Japan business mood turns positive: government survey,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at big Japanese manufacturers turned positive in July-September and they expect business conditions to improve further in the following quarter, a government survey showed, suggesting a gradual economic recovery from the slump after April's sales tax hike.
The survey also showed that companies are growing more positive on business investment, boding well for the government's goal of fostering a sustainable growth cycle led by pick up in business activity, higher wages and stronger consumer spending.
The business survey index (BSI) of sentiment at large manufacturers stood at plus 12.7 in July-September, improving from minus 13.9 in the prior three months.
The big manufacturers' sentiment index is seen improving to plus 15.1 in October-December, it showed.
The joint survey by the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet Office suggests that the central bank's key tankan survey out on Oct.1 is likely to show a steady improvement in business sentiment in the three months to September.
""It's true business sentiment soured temporarily after the April sales tax hike. But that hasn't dampened companies' spending appetite too much,"" said Junko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS Securities.
""Overall, conditions surrounding corporate activity doesn't look too bad.""
Weak readings in the BOJ's tankan could heighten pressure on the Bank of Japan to deliver fresh stimulus to sustain growth, although the bank remains bullish on the economy and it is in no mood now to loosen hyper-easy monetary policy further.
The April's sales tax hike to 8 percent from 5 percent triggered the deepest slump in the second quarter since the 2009 global financial crisis, raising questions about whether the government will proceed with a second-stage tax rise planned for next year.
The strength of an expected rebound in the current quarter will be crucial to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's decision, expected by year-end, on whether to go ahead with the tax rise to 10 percent in October 2015.
The BSI measures the percentage of firms that expect the business environment to improve from the previous quarter minus the percentage that expect it to worsen. A positive reading means optimists outnumber pessimists.
The quarterly survey showed the sentiment among big non-manufacturers, including retailers hit hard by the tax hike, improving to plus 10.2 from minus 15.0 in April-June, bringing the overall mood among big businesses to plus 11.1.
The service-sector mood is expected to worsen to plus 7.2 in October-December, and overall big business sentiment is seen worsening to plus 9.9, it showed.
Manufacturers plan to raise capital expenditure by 13.3 percent in the current fiscal year to next March, more than a 10.8 percent increase seen in the previous survey.
Non-manufacturers plan to raise their business investment by 2.0 percent this fiscal year, compared with a 1.5 percent rise seen in the prior survey.
The last BOJ tankan showed on July 1 that big manufacturers' mood worsened in the three months to June but it was seen improving in the current quarter.
The central bank stuck with its massive asset buying stimulus program last week and maintained its view the economy would continue its steady recovery toward its 2 percent inflation target, signaling it sees no immediate need for further monetary stimulus.
However, many private economists remain skeptical that it can achieve that price goal in the next fiscal year.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday wholesale inventories edged up 0.1 percent, the smallest rise since July of last year, after a 0.2 percent gain in June. 
Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product changes. The component that goes into the calculation of GDP - wholesale stocks excluding autos - was flat. 
The rise in overall stocks at wholesalers in July was well below the 0.5 percent increase that Wall Street had anticipated, leading some economists to lower their GDP growth estimates for the July-September quarter. 
Barclays cut its third-quarter growth estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent annual rate. Action Economics lowered its forecast to a 2.8 percent pace from 3.0 percent. 
A report last week showed stocks of manufactured goods at factories rose only 0.1 percent in July. Retail inventory data for July, due to be released on Friday, will shed more light on the state of restocking early in the third quarter. 
Inventories added 1.4 percentage points to GDP growth in the second quarter. The slow pace of inventory accumulation, however, bodes well for fourth-quarter growth. 
""While there is very little information about fourth-quarter growth available at this point, a more modest inventory accumulation in the third quarter is a positive development for fourth-quarter GDP, all else equal,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. 
Wholesale inventories in July were held back by declines in stocks of farm products, chemicals, furniture, professional equipment, petroleum, paper and metals. Auto inventories increased 1.0 percent in July after declining 0.2 percent in June. 
Sales at wholesalers rose 0.7 percent in July after climbing 0.4 percent in June. 

At July's sales pace it would take 1.16 months to clear shelves, the lowest since December 2013 and down from 1.17 months in June.

857,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2014 12:00AM ET</span>",Soft bounce in Japan machinery orders leaves doubts on outlook,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core machinery orders rose for a second straight month in July, but analysts said the data failed to dispel some doubts about the strength of business investment that is needed to propel Japan out of the slump caused by April's sales tax hike.
The 3.5 percent rise in core orders, a highly volatile data series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, was less than the median estimate of a 4.0 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists.
That followed a 8.8 percent rise in June and a 19.5 percent drop in May, which was the biggest drop in data going back to 2005.
The data followed a recent run of weak economic indicators that suggest a rebound expected this quarter from April's slump may not prove as strong as originally thought.
Weak readings cloud the prospects of a planned increase in the sales tax in October 2015, while keeping policymakers under pressure to provide fresh stimulus to prop up the economy.
""Some companies are still cautious about demand. I expect the second sales tax hike to happen, but keep an eye out for more stimulus from the government,"" said Hiroaki Muto, senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.
The core orders were boosted by one big order from a chemicals producer, a government official said, adding that excluding the one-off factor overall growth in July was moderate.
The Cabinet Office data showed orders from manufacturers for new machinery rose 20.3 percent in July - thanks to the big order from a chemicals producer - while those from non-manufacturers fell 4.3 percent.
""The rebound was weak. Manufacturers may be turning cautious about capital spending due to sluggish exports and consumption, and the decline in orders from nonmanufacturers likely reflect weak domestic demand,"" said Koya Miyamae, senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
The Cabinet Office stuck to its assessment of machinery orders, saying they are ""seesawing"".
Capital spending holds the key to the success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's reflationary policies dubbed Abenomics, which policymakers are counting on to generate a virtuous cycle of growing business output, household income and spending.
Companies held off spending in April-June after boosting investment earlier this year on factors such as upgrading of Windows operating systems. As the temporary factors run their course, analysts expect capital spending will resume picking up due to steady corporate earnings, a well as the need to upgrade aging equipment and manage a labor shortage.
Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude ships and power utilities, rose 1.1 percent in July, versus the expected 0.6 percent rise, the Cabinet Office data showed.
Revised data showed on Monday that Japan's economy shrank an annualized 7.1 percent in April-June as capital spending slid and private consumption took a hit from the sales tax hike. Analysts in a Reuters poll forecast a 3.8 percent bounce this quarter.
The strength of an expected rebound in the current quarter will be crucial to Abe's decision, expected by year-end, on whether to proceed with the scheduled second increase in the sales tax to 10 percent in October 2015.

The National Federation of Independent Business said its Small Business Optimism Index rose 0.4 point to 96.1. 
Eight of the index's 10 components either improved or showed no change in the survey based on a random sample of 598 small business owners. 
The job growth indicated in the survey was sluggish, with owners adding an average of only 0.02 workers per firm, and fewer saying they planned to hire more workers in the future. 
Some businesses appeared to lose pricing power, with 15 percent of respondents saying they had reduced prices, and a drop in the number of owners saying they planned price hikes. 
Though more owners said they expect an improvement in business conditions than said so in the month before, a slight majority still are not convinced conditions will improve. 
The index is still 4 points below where it was before the start of the 2007 financial crisis and recession, though it has been making progress back toward that level. 
Overall the index points to economic growth slightly slower than that expected by many forecasters and Federal Reserve officials. 

The results of the survey point to economic growth of around 2 percent this year, not the greater than 3 percent growth cited by other forecasters.

880,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2014 06:14PM ET</span>",U.S. consumer credit soars in July with biggest gain since '01,"By Michael Flaherty WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer credit soared in July, posting its biggest jump since November 2001, driven in part by demand for auto loans and student borrowings.
Total consumer credit increased $26.01 billion to $3.24 trillion in July, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. June's consumer credit figure was revised up to show an $18.81 billion increase from $17.26 billion.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected consumer credit to increase $17.35 billion in July.
Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial, said the credit growth is being driven by auto loans, though he added that signs of loose standards and spikes in default rates are showing.
""The only thing we have to worry about is there is excessive risk-taking in the auto sector,"" said Low. ""But it's still a good thing for the economy at least in the short term. Car sales are back to where they were before the financial crisis, which is remarkable.""
The previous record was an increase of around $28 billion recorded in November 2001, according to a Fed spokesman. That occurred shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks when big automakers were offering zero-percent financing and other incentives to lure consumers back to their showrooms.
Revolving credit, which mostly measures credit-card use, increased $5.34 billion to $880.5 billion, after an upwardly revised $1.81 billion increase in June.
Non-revolving credit, which includes auto loans as well as student loans made by the government, increased $20.65 billion in July to $2.36 trillion after an upwardly revised $16.99 billion increase in June.
""People are feeling more comfortable in their jobs, and more comfortable with the economy,"" said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, who pointed to auto loans and student lending as driving the growth.

""Too many times, we see people spend amounts of money they can't afford,"" Schulz said. ""But people seem to be feeling more confident, and if they can afford the spending, then that's great for the economy.""

892,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2014 01:21AM ET</span>",China's August imports fall unexpectedly but exports buoyant,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's import growth unexpectedly fell for the second consecutive month in August, posting its worst performance in over a year and stoking speculation about whether authorities should loosen policy further to revive domestic demand.
Imports by the world's second-biggest economy fell 2.4 percent in August compared with a year ago, the General Administration of Customs said on Monday, missing a Reuters estimate for a 1.7 percent rise.
It was the second straight month that China's import growth was surprisingly weak, raising concerns that tepid domestic demand exacerbated by a cooling housing market is increasingly weighing on the economy.
In contrast, China's exports were surprisingly buoyant in August amid stronger global demand. They jumped 9.4 percent from a year earlier to beat a forecast rise of 8 percent, although the growth rate slowed from 14.5 percent in July.
That pushed the trade surplus to an unexpected all-time high of $49.8 billion, which could put further appreciation pressure on the yuan currency <CNY=CFXS>.
Although falling commodity prices have magnified the weakness in imports as China's trade data is measured in terms of value, analysts said Chinese demand also seemed to be fizzling.
""It's an interesting set of numbers for policymakers,"" said Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS.
""It calls for more policy easing, but at the same time, strong exports and a record surplus will put some pressure on policymakers to let the currency rise in some way or the other.""
China's economy has had a bumpy ride this year. Growth rebounded slightly in the second quarter from an 18-month low thanks to a stream of government stimulus measures, but hopes that the recovery would gain traction were dashed in July when data showed activity was stumbling again.
As a result, authorities have repeatedly warned that China may miss its target to grow its trade sector by 7.5 percent this year, even though they maintained that the broader economy can grow by around 7.5 percent in 2014.
Indeed, a breakdown of Monday's trade data showed Chinese exports slowed across most major markets, compared with July when growth hit a 15-month high.
Exports to the United States, the top buyer of Chinese exports, rose 11.4 percent from a year earlier, compared with July's 12.3 percent increase. Sales to Europe, where factory activity is faltering, cooled to 12.1 percent on an annual basis, from July's 17 percent.
In terms of imports, purchases from Europe - a major seller of goods and services to China - fell to a 14-month low of 4.5 percent from a year earlier.
Some analysts said the lacklustre data corroborated with figures seen elsewhere. Steel demand, for instance, has not rebounded despite a steep fall in iron ore prices, noted Mark Pervan, head of research at ANZ Bank.
""That's telling you that they are more cautious on short-term demand,"" Pervan said, referring to steel mills. ""I think that's because of the direction of the housing market currently, which is moving downward.""
PROPERTY DRAG
China's trade sector is a major employer in the country even though it dragged on the economy last year - net exports subtracted 4.4 percent from gross domestic product.
The export sector was also surprisingly buoyant in July, helping the trade surplus to balloon to a then record of $47.3 billion. The upbeat performance was helped in part by a strengthening U.S. economy, China's top export destination.
But risks posed by the cooling property sector have dimmed any optimism brought on by perkier foreign demand.
The real estate sector, which accounts for about 15 percent of China's economic output, is experiencing its worst downturn in two years as sales and prices turn south.
The housing slump, combined with a startling drop in credit supply last month to a six-year low, has led many analysts to predict that China's leaders need to loosen policy further and offer more stimulus if they wish to grow the economy by the targeted 7.5 percent.
More analysts are calling for the central bank to cut banks' reserve requirement ratio nationwide, though the majority still feel that the central bank is not likely to cut interest rates.
""The trade data indicated downward pressure on China's economy,"" said Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin Wanguo in Shanghai. ""Policymakers may need to enhance their efforts to support the domestic economy if industrial output growth slows to 8.6 percent or below in coming months.""
August industrial output data later this week is expected to show a slowdown to 8.8 percent growth from 9.0 percent in July. Growth in retail sales and fixed-asset investment likely also cooled slightly.
CURRENCY PRESSURE
With China's trade surplus expanding to record levels, som
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's import growth unexpectedly fell for the second consecutive month in August, posting its worst performance in over a year and stoking speculation about whether authorities should loosen policy further to revive domestic demand.
Imports by the world's second-biggest economy fell 2.4 percent in August compared with a year ago, the General Administration of Customs said on Monday, missing a Reuters estimate for a 1.7 percent rise.
It was the second straight month that China's import growth was surprisingly weak, raising concerns that tepid domestic demand exacerbated by a cooling housing market is increasingly weighing on the economy.
In contrast, China's exports were surprisingly buoyant in August amid stronger global demand. They jumped 9.4 percent from a year earlier to beat a forecast rise of 8 percent, although the growth rate slowed from 14.5 percent in July.
That pushed the trade surplus to an unexpected all-time high of $49.8 billion, which could put further appreciation pressure on the yuan currency <CNY=CFXS>.
Although falling commodity prices have magnified the weakness in imports as China's trade data is measured in terms of value, analysts said Chinese demand also seemed to be fizzling.
""It's an interesting set of numbers for policymakers,"" said Louis Kuijs, an economist at RBS.
""It calls for more policy easing, but at the same time, strong exports and a record surplus will put some pressure on policymakers to let the currency rise in some way or the other.""
China's economy has had a bumpy ride this year. Growth rebounded slightly in the second quarter from an 18-month low thanks to a stream of government stimulus measures, but hopes that the recovery would gain traction were dashed in July when data showed activity was stumbling again.
As a result, authorities have repeatedly warned that China may miss its target to grow its trade sector by 7.5 percent this year, even though they maintained that the broader economy can grow by around 7.5 percent in 2014.
Indeed, a breakdown of Monday's trade data showed Chinese exports slowed across most major markets, compared with July when growth hit a 15-month high.
Exports to the United States, the top buyer of Chinese exports, rose 11.4 percent from a year earlier, compared with July's 12.3 percent increase. Sales to Europe, where factory activity is faltering, cooled to 12.1 percent on an annual basis, from July's 17 percent.
In terms of imports, purchases from Europe - a major seller of goods and services to China - fell to a 14-month low of 4.5 percent from a year earlier.
Some analysts said the lacklustre data corroborated with figures seen elsewhere. Steel demand, for instance, has not rebounded despite a steep fall in iron ore prices, noted Mark Pervan, head of research at ANZ Bank.
""That's telling you that they are more cautious on short-term demand,"" Pervan said, referring to steel mills. ""I think that's because of the direction of the housing market currently, which is moving downward.""
PROPERTY DRAG
China's trade sector is a major employer in the country even though it dragged on the economy last year - net exports subtracted 4.4 percent from gross domestic product.
The export sector was also surprisingly buoyant in July, helping the trade surplus to balloon to a then record of $47.3 billion. The upbeat performance was helped in part by a strengthening U.S. economy, China's top export destination.
But risks posed by the cooling property sector have dimmed any optimism brought on by perkier foreign demand.
The real estate sector, which accounts for about 15 percent of China's economic output, is experiencing its worst downturn in two years as sales and prices turn south.
The housing slump, combined with a startling drop in credit supply last month to a six-year low, has led many analysts to predict that China's leaders need to loosen policy further and offer more stimulus if they wish to grow the economy by the targeted 7.5 percent.
More analysts are calling for the central bank to cut banks' reserve requirement ratio nationwide, though the majority still feel that the central bank is not likely to cut interest rates.
""The trade data indicated downward pressure on China's economy,"" said Li Huiyong, an economist at Shenyin Wanguo in Shanghai. ""Policymakers may need to enhance their efforts to support the domestic economy if industrial output growth slows to 8.6 percent or below in coming months.""
August industrial output data later this week is expected to show a slowdown to 8.8 percent growth from 9.0 percent in July. Growth in retail sales and fixed-asset investment likely also cooled slightly.
CURRENCY PRESSURE
With China's trade surplus expanding to record levels, some economists said the yuan could rise further, driven by stronger market demand, after hitting a near six-month high last week.
That could force China's central bank to decide whether it should let the yuan rise further at the cost of hurting Chinese exporters, or intervene in the foreign exchange market to temper the currency's strength.
The yuan is a lightning rod issue between China and its major trade partners including the United States, which accuse China of deliberately suppressing the currency to help its exporters.
China has always denied such accusations, even though its central bank is often seen by traders to be intervening in the currency market.

""The large trade surplus, plus the decent renminbi yields, will add appreciation pressure on the renminbi if the central bank does not intervene intensively in the market,"" ANZ economists said in a note on Monday.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 05, 2014 05:46PM ET</span>","U.S. job growth brakes to eight-month low, labor force shrinks","By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employers hired the fewest number of workers in eight months in August and more Americans gave up the hunt for jobs, providing a cautious Federal Reserve with more reasons to wait longer before raising interest rates.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 142,000 last month after expanding by 212,000 in July, the Labor Department said on Friday. The jobless rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 6.1 percent, but that was partly because people dropped out of the labor force.
""Fed Chair Janet Yellen will be able to use the weakness to hold off hawks who would like to raise rates soon,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.
Data for June and July were revised to show 28,000 fewer jobs created than previously reported. In addition, manufacturing saw no job growth and retail payrolls declined for the first time since February, although a workforce disruption at a grocery store chain in New England weighed on the count.
Even though job growth slowed, the report still suggested that some of the slack in the labor market was being taken up.
U.S. stocks ended higher, notching a fifth straight week of gains. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose marginally, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies even though economists had expected payrolls to rise by 225,000.
Interest rate futures, which had pointed to a likely rate hike in June of next year, rose to suggest less of a chance. Nevertheless, a Reuters poll of top bond firms found nine of 17 looked for an increase in borrowing costs in the second quarter; a poll a month ago showed only six of 19 expected such a move.
Swonk and other economists questioned whether the data was presenting an accurate picture given that it was at odds with other bullish labor market indicators.
They noted that first-time applications for unemployment benefits are hovering near pre-recession levels, that manufacturing and service sector surveys showed strong jobs growth in August, and that household perceptions of the labor market had brightened significantly.
In addition, difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations have tended to understate job growth in August, and the end of a mass employee walkout at the grocery chain Market Basket could lead to a bounce in retail employment this month.
""The fundamentals in the economy remain solid, this is one month, and the economy should continue to expand at a decent pace in the second half of 2014,"" said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh.
NUMBER OF LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED EASES
Yellen has expressed concern about sluggish wage growth, the still-elevated number of Americans working part-time even though they want full-time employment, and Americans still suffering from long spells of joblessness.
The U.S. central bank, which has held benchmark interest rates near zero since December 2008, has pointed to these metrics as evidence of ""significant underutilization"" of labor market resources that merits a stimulative monetary policy.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, fell to 62.8 percent in August from 62.9 percent in July. Before the United States fell into recession, it stood at 66.0 percent.
A paper published on Thursday by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, suggested the decline was primarily due to an aging population and other structural factors, and concluded the labor force would continue to shrink.
Other metrics on Yellen's so-called dashboard, however, showed improvement.
A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment fell to 12.0 percent, the lowest level since October 2009.
The gap between that figure and the official unemployment rate narrowed, a further sign of tightening labor market conditions. At the same time, the number of long-term unemployed Americans was the lowest since January 2009.
Average hourly earnings rose 6 cents in August, which marked an acceleration from July. Still, the year-on-year change held at 2.1 percent, which suggests little buildup of wage-related inflation pressure.
The Fed next meets on Sept. 16-17 to debate the course of monetary policy.
Jobs in the private sector increased 134,000 after rising by 213,000 in July. Government employment increased 8,000 as state governments hired teachers at the start of the new school year.
But manufacturing payrolls were the weakest in a year. The sector had added a hefty 28,000 jobs in July, which reflected a decision by automakers to keep assembly lines running in the summer. Auto payrolls fell 4,600, the first decline since March.
Construction employment advanced 20,000, the eighth straight monthly gain.

The 8,400 jobs lost among retailers reflected a drop of more than 17,000 in food and beverage store payrolls.

900,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 05, 2014 02:15PM ET</span>",Here's The Best Indicator Of The Real State Of The US Economy,"By Hanna Sender - The slight dip in the U.S. unemployment rate reported by the Labor Department on Friday morning may seem encouraging but it's not the best barometer of the economy because it only measures people who have looked for a job in the past four weeks. To really get a sense of the state of the economic recovery, look at the employment to population ratio, which includes all those in the labor force and is therefore much more comprehensive. Everyone who is between the ages of 16 and 64 who are not working, even those ignored by the unemployment rate -- the long-term unemployed and people who are not looking for jobs -- are counted in the ratio. That ratio has remained at 59 percent for the third month in a row, another sign that the economy has never truly recovered from the recession.

The rate has risen only slightly from its post-recession low of 58.2 and is still nowhere near the the pre-recession high of 64 percent. The unemployment rate, however, shows a slow but healthy recovery, nearing where it was 10 years ago. As one Zero Hedge contributer noted, ""one thing is clear: the ratio crashed when the depression started and has flatlined since.""

Hiring in August dipped to 142,000 jobs, below economists' estimates of a rosy above-200,000 and below an average pace of 212,000 jobs added monthly over the past 12 months. 

The unemployment rate ticked down to 6.1 percent, compared to 6.2 percent in July and 6.1 percent in June.
Over the past seven months, the economy has added 1.7 million jobs, the most since 2006. Hiring for July was revised up to 212,000 from 209,000 and hiring for June was revised down to 267,000 from 298,000. Still, economists would like to see job growth accelerate.
The unemployment rate doesn't count the number of Americans who have given up searching for work. That information is, however, included in the labor force participation rate, which gauges the number of Americans who are working or looking for work.
In July, the labor force participation rate rose slightly — to 62.9 percent from 62.8 percent, where it had been for three months — but that's still an historically low level.
The unemployment rate has fallen by 1.1 percentage points over the past 12 months. If job growth remains as strong as it was this summer, it will dip to 5.5 percent by January and settle around 5.2 percent in the spring."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies hired workers at a steady clip in August and services sector activity accelerated to 6-1/2-year high, assurances the economy was on track for sturdy growth in the third quarter. 
That view was reinforced by other data on Thursday showing only a slight increase in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week and a narrowing in the trade deficit to its lowest point in six months in July. 
""The story line of underlying growth momentum at least being sustained and at best picking up this quarter has more or less been confirmed,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Payrolls processing firm ADP said private-sector payrolls increased by 204,000 last month after rising by 212,000 in July, with gains spread across a range of industries. 
While the report was a bit softer than economists expected, it marked the fifth straight month of gains above 200,000 and augured well for a broader report on hiring that the government will release on Friday. 
In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 59.6 last month, the highest reading since its inception in January 2008, from 58.7 in July. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the vast services sectors. A subindex of service industry jobs showed strong growth for the sixth straight month. 
The government on Friday is expected to report that nonfarm payrolls increased by 225,000 last month after advancing by 209,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists. 
The upbeat jobs market picture was also captured in another report from the Labor Department that showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits last week held at levels consistent with a tightening of labor market conditions. 
""The broad evidence is that the labor market continues to improve at a very solid rate,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
The jobs market is being closely monitored for clues as to when the Federal Reserve will start tightening monetary policy, having kept its benchmark overnight lending rate near zero since December 2008. Economists expect an interest rate increase sometime in the first half of 2015. 
TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS 
The services report added to bullish auto sales and manufacturing data in suggesting a solid base for growth, as did the report on international trade. 
The Commerce Department said the U.S. trade deficit fell 0.6 percent to $40.5 billion in July, its smallest size since January. When adjusted for inflation, it reached its narrowest point since December 2013, prompting economists to raise their estimates for third-quarter gross domestic product. 
Goldman Sachs lifted its GDP growth forecast by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.2 percent annual rate, while Morgan Stanley raised its estimate to a 3.3 percent pace from 3.0 percent. 
The fairly upbeat data coupled with an interest rate cut from the European Central Bank helped to buoy U.S. stocks, while the dollar rallied to a 14-month high against the euro. U.S. Treasury debt prices were trading lower. 
In July, exports rose 0.9 percent to a record high, with automobile and non-petroleum exports surging to all-time highs. 
That eclipsed a 0.7 percent rebound in imports. The rise in imports, which was driven by food and autos, is a sign of underlying strength in domestic demand. 
Another month of declines in petroleum imports on the back of the U.S. energy boom pushed the petroleum deficit to its lowest level since May 2009. 

But the politically sensitive trade gap with China was the highest on record.

934,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 03, 2014 03:01PM ET</span>",Fed Says US Economy Grew Modestly In June And July,"By Meagan Clark - The U.S. economy over the last two months painted a grim picture for the average worker, showing only modest wage growth, but the data showed improving pay for skilled workers in areas like health care and information technology. Economists are keeping a particularly close eye on wage growth as it has not kept up with gains in other metrics measuring the overall economy.
Wage gains are important as they provide the extra cash to workers to fuel the roughly 70 percent of the nation's economy driven by consumer spending.
Overall the economy continued growing modestly this summer as employment, wages and prices slightly increased on the strength of stronger car sales and tourism, the Fed said Wednesday.
The central bank’s district-by-district survey, called the beige book, reported that economic activity in June and July “expanded since the previous Beige Book report; however, none of the Districts pointed to a distinct shift in the overall pace of growth.”
“This is largely a steady-as-she-goes beige book with most districts reporting consistent trajectories of key economic variables,” said Jared Bernstein, chief economist and economic policy adviser at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.
The beige book, issued eight times a year, is meant to offer economists and Fed watchers a peek inside the regional factors that have affected the national economy in the last two months.
The 12 districts reported few changes in wages, though Richmond said wage growth has slowed in the region due to the manufacturing and service sectors there. Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco reported greater pressures on employers to raise wages for jobs in energy, construction, trucking, manufacturing, engineering, information technology, finance and health care, among others, with the strongest wage pressures in specific categories of skilled workers.
“We know that Chair [Janet] Yellen is looking closely at the wage results, and here, it’s notable that labor market conditions were again described as modest or relatively unchanged,” Bernstein said. 
The previous beige book, released July 16, noted modest economic growth and modest wage increases, aside from skilled positions, in April and May. Some employers in the energy and technology sectors, in Dallas and San Francisco respectively, hiked wages significantly for skilled positions as they struggled to find qualified workers. The Fed has characterized growth as “moderate” or “modest” for more than a year.
About half the districts reported stable or growing residential real estate activity, suggesting that growth in the housing sector remains weak. Many districts also reported that credit conditions are slowly loosening.

Economists generally view the beige book as a supplemental report without much substance that would hint at coming changes in economic or monetary policy. While some studies have concluded the report offers a bit of unique information, other studies disagree.
“Anecdotes can be useful sources of information, but my guess is that much of this anecdotal evidence would not be reported in the beige book unless regional Fed officials had other hard statistical evidence that supports the same conclusions about the local economy,” said Gary Burtless, labor economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
“The anecdotal evidence… does matter,” Paul Donovan, global research analyst for the Swiss financial services company UBS, wrote in a note ahead of the report’s release. “However, the overall tone of the beige book has been ‘behind the curve’ of economic reality in recent publications. The Fed may be underestimating or downplaying the recovery.”
A former Fed vice chairman, Alan Binder, famously compared the report in the nineties to asking one’s uncle about the state of the economy.
The Federal Reserve’s policy-making committee next meets on Sept. 16 and 17.

935,By International Business Times,"<span>Sep 03, 2014 11:01AM ET</span>","Russia Ukraine Crisis: Domestic Russian Air Travel Grows As Conflict, Low Fares Keep Tourists At Home ","By Greg Morcroft - Air travel remained flat globally in July but the overall data masked solid growth in regional markets, which offset modest weakness in places like China, which is experiencing slowing growth, and Europe, itself fighting a return to recession.
According to The International Air Transport Association's (IATA) Director General and CEO Tony Tyler:
July was another strong month of growth for air travel. People are connecting by air in ever greater numbers. That’s true across all regions. Despite the various economic challenges, the outlook for passenger travel remains broadly positive. The overall sluggishness at the beginning of the year appears to be behind us with growth in China and other emerging economies offsetting recent deterioration in the Eurozone.
Going forward the group warned that there are some real and present challenges for the airline industry despite its July results. Tyler cautioned that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, weakness in the Eurozone and open warfare in the Mideast all could hurt air travel.

Here are some highlights from the report:
Air travel volumes rose by a solid 5.3% in July year-on-year, a slight pick-up on June when revenue passenger kilometers were up 4.6% on a year ago. The outlook for air travel remains broadly positive, despite recent adverse developments in some regions.
Business activity at the start of Q3 is in line with the 4-month high reached in June. In addition, demand conditions are picking up in emerging markets like China, which could help offset some of the recent weakness in the Eurozone recovery. Current growth in air travel volumes should be at least sustained in the months ahead. 
Despite the Russia-Ukraine crisis, domestic revenue passenger kilometers (a main traffic gauge) in Russia have increased at the strongest rate among markets in July, rising 9.9% year-on-year. The crisis has caused a slowdown in economic growth in Russia. Airlines have been able to maintain demand for domestic air travel through significant reductions in fares.

The Commerce Department said on Wednesday new orders for manufactured goods increased a record 10.5 percent. June's orders were revised to show a 1.5 percent increase instead of the previously reported 1.1 percent rise.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new orders received by factories advancing 11.0 percent in July.
Orders excluding the volatile transportation category slipped 0.8 percent in July. But that followed a 1.4 percent increase the prior month, leaving the overall trend positive for manufacturing.
Manufacturing is accelerating, with the Institute for Supply Management reporting on Tuesday that its gauge of factory activity hit its highest level in nearly 3-1/2 years in August. In addition, a measure of new orders touched a 10-year high.
In July, orders for transportation equipment soared a record 74.1 percent, reflecting outsized civilian aircraft orders received by Boeing BA.N that was flagged in the durable goods orders report published last week.
Capital goods orders surged a record 52.5 percent. But orders for primary metals, machinery, computers and electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.
The Commerce Department also said orders for durable goods, manufactured products expected to last three years and more, increased 22.6 percent in July, as reported last week.
Durable goods orders excluding transportation slipped 0.7 percent instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent fall.
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - declined by a slightly bigger 0.7 percent. They were previously reported to have slipped 0.5 percent."

939,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 03, 2014 09:10AM ET</span>",U.S. consumers turn to auto loans at a record rate,"By Peter Rudegeair NEW YORK (Reuters) - A record number of U.S. consumers are taking out loans to buy cars, especially those purchasing used vehicles, according to data released on Wednesday.
In the second quarter, 85 percent of new car purchases and 53.8 percent of used car purchases were financed, according to data from Experian Plc (L:EXPN), an information provider.
That was up 0.5 percentage points and 0.9 percentage points, respectively from the same period in 2013.
Additionally, the size of auto loan amounts and monthly payments continued to rise, especially for used cars. Since the second quarter of 2013, the average used vehicle loan rose 1.9 percent to $18,258 and the average monthly payment on such vehicles rose 1.1 percent to $355, both all-time highs.
""More and more consumers, especially those that are credit challenged, are turning to the used vehicle market as a viable option to purchase their next car,"" said Melinda Zabritski, senior director of automotive finance for Experian, in a statement.
Banks were the largest lenders to consumers buying used cars, financing 35.6 percent of all such purchases, or 0.8 percentage points less than the second quarter of last year.
In recent years banks have begun to focus more on the used car market as automakers' in-house financing arms came to dominate the new car market. Such ""captive"" finance companies made more than one out of every two new car loans in the second quarter, according to Experian.
Regulators have become more concerned with banks' willingness to lengthen terms on car loans, lend to borrowers with lower credit scores and give out loans that are larger than vehicles are worth.
In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice has started investigating subprime auto loans that companies such as General Motors Co's (N:GM) auto financing arm and Santander Consumer Holdings USA Inc (N:SC) have made and securitized since 2007.
But at least in the second quarter, the share of both new car and used car loans that went to borrowers with subprime credit scores declined, according to Experian.
""Lenders are still showing cautionary signs when lending to the subprime market and keeping their risk at manageable levels,"" Zabritski said.
Wells Fargo & Co (N:WFC) remained the largest U.S. auto lender in the second quarter with a market share of 5.75 percent, down from 5.89 percent a year prior.
Capital One Financial Corp (N:COF) surged past JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to become the third largest U.S. auto lender after Ally Financial Inc (N:ALLY). The McLean, Virginia-based bank's share of the used car market rose from 3.77 percent to 4.20 percent.

950,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 02, 2014 08:11PM ET</span>","Manufacturing, construction data point to sturdy growth","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing activity hit a nearly 3-1/2-year high last month and construction spending rebounded strongly in July, signs the economy entered the third quarter on strong footing. 
Tuesday's upbeat data added to reports on employment and housing that have suggested growth remains sturdy, despite a slowdown in consumer spending in recent months. 
""Things continue to fall into place for our view that growth should accelerate in the year's back half,"" said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG in New York. 
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose to 59.0 last month, the highest reading since March 2011, from 57.1 in July. 
A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. Economists had expected a pullback to 56.8. August's reading was lifted by a surge in a gauge of new orders, which touched its highest level 10 years. Order backlogs and new export orders also rose. 
U.S. manufacturers fared better in August than factories in Europe and Asia, which have been hurt more by escalating tensions in Ukraine and a patchy recovery in China. 
The new orders index correlates closely with quarterly changes in gross domestic product. Carl Riccadonna, a senior economist at Deutsche Bank in New York, said the current level of new orders has historically been consistent with an annualized GDP growth pace of 4.4 percent. 
Manufacturers were mostly upbeat in August, with business conditions described as improving, good, strong and robust. Furniture manufacturers said labor was becoming an issue. 
The bullish manufacturing picture was corroborated by another factory survey. Financial data firm Markit said its U.S. manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 57.9, the highest level since April 2010, from 55.8 in July. 
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies on the data, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. The industrial index <.SPLRCI> was flat, outperforming the broader stock market, which was down after a big rally in August. 
BULLISH CONSTRUCTION 
The bright growth picture was underscored by a report from the Commerce Department that showed construction spending increased 1.8 percent in July to a 5-1/2-year high. It was the largest monthly gain since May 2012. 
In addition, construction outlays for May and June were revised up, which left some economists expecting the government to raise its second-quarter GDP estimate by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 4.4 percent rate later this month. 
Third-quarter growth estimates currently range as high as a 3.5 percent pace, and some economists say the run of relatively strong economic data, if sustained, could prompt an early interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve. 
""We think that there will be a shift in forward guidance at the September policy meeting to a more neutral posture that would allow for a rate hike early in 2015,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
Construction spending in July was buoyed by a 3.4 percent jump in outlays for state and local government projects. That offset a 1.1 percent drop in spending by the federal government. 

Private construction advanced 1.4 percent to its highest level since November 2008.

Prices at factory gates in the 18 countries sharing the euro fell as anticipated by 0.1 percent in July against June and dropped 1.1 percent on the year, the EU's statistics office Eurostat said on Tuesday.
The annual drop was the steepest since April's 1.2 percent decline.
Producer prices are an early indication of price trends. Unless their fluctuations are absorbed by retailers, they eventually translate into consumer inflation or deflation.
Both the monthly and the annual declines were influenced by a 0.6 percent and 3.5 percent drop respectively in the costs of energy, data showed.
Prices in all other sectors, such as durable and non-durable consumer goods, were flat in July when compared with June.
The ECB meets on Thursday, facing a dilemma how to respond to vanishing inflation in the 9.6 trillion euro economy whose recovery unexpectedly stalled in the second quarter, only two months after an interest rate cut in June.
A majority of economists expect the ECB to stay on hold in September and wait for effects of its last rate cut to kick in, including targeted longer-term refinancing operations aimed to boost bank landing.
Producer prices in July, when compared with the same period last year, rose only in three euro zone countries - Estonia, Ireland and Latvia and were flat in the twice bailed-out Greece.
The largest year-on-year drop was recorded in Belgium with a 5.7 percent decline, followed by Slovakia's 2.9 percent annual fall.

“UK construction firms saw one of the sharpest rises in output for seven years in August, with increasing workloads driven by an array of factors including surging homebuilding activity, greater infrastructure spending and renewed confidence within the commercial development sector,” said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit and author of the report.

Statement by Glenn Stevens, Governor: Monetary Policy Decision
At its meeting today, the Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.
Growth in the global economy is continuing at a moderate pace. China's growth remains generally in line with policymakers' objectives, with weakening property markets a challenge in the near term. Commodity prices in historical terms remain high, but some of those important to Australia have declined this year.
Financial conditions overall remain very accommodative. Long-term interest rates and risk spreads remain very low. Volatility in many financial prices is currently unusually low. Markets appear to be attaching a very low probability to any rise in global interest rates or other adverse event over the period ahead.
In Australia, the most recent survey data indicate gradually improving business conditions and some recovery in household sentiment after a weaker period around mid year, suggesting moderate growth in the economy is occurring. Resources sector investment spending is starting to decline significantly. Investment intentions in some other sectors continue to improve, though these areas of capital spending are expected to see only moderate growth in the near term. Public spending is scheduled to be subdued. Overall, the Bank still expects growth to be a little below trend over the year ahead.
The recorded rate of unemployment has increased recently, despite some improvement in most other indicators for the labour market this year. The Bank's assessment remains that the labour market has a degree of spare capacity and that it will probably be some time yet before unemployment declines consistently. Growth in wages has declined noticeably and is expected to remain relatively modest over the period ahead, which should keep inflation consistent with the target even with lower levels of the exchange rate.
Monetary policy remains accommodative. Interest rates are very low and have continued to edge lower over recent months as competition to lend has increased. Investors continue to look for higher returns in response to low rates on safe instruments. Credit growth has picked up a little, including most recently to businesses. The increase in dwelling prices continues. The exchange rate, on the other hand, remains above most estimates of its fundamental value, particularly given the declines in key commodity prices. It is offering less assistance than would normally be expected in achieving balanced growth in the economy.
Looking ahead, continued accommodative monetary policy should provide support to demand and help growth to strengthen over time. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years.
In the Board's judgement, monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. On present indications, the most prudent course is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates

964,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2014 08:00AM ET</span>","Factory activity in Europe, Asia cools; demand lull a concern","By Sumanta Dey and Wayne Cole BANGALORE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Factory activity in Europe and Asia cooled in August after a strong July, as new orders dwindled in the face of escalating tensions in Ukraine and a patchy recovery in China, purchasing managers indexes showed.
Despite euro zone manufacturers barely raising their prices, growth in the region slowed slightly more than initially thought, and activity in China's vast factory sector slackened on weak foreign and domestic demand, stoking speculation that further policy stimulus would be needed.
""A concerted slowdown in the China, euro zone and UK manufacturing PMIs as the second quarter gets under way raises alarm bells about global demand conditions,"" said Lena Komileva, chief economist at G+ Economics in London.
""This raises serious questions about the ability of major economies such as the U.S. and the UK, to weather higher interest rates, or in the case of the euro zone to withstand deflationary pressures without further stimulus.""
Euro zone factories stumbled with the final August PMI at 50.7, the lowest in over a year, as new orders slowed amidst rising tensions over Ukraine that have triggered sanctions from the West and countermeasures from Russia.
Still, that was the 14th month the index has been above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trade partner in the European Union, fell to an 11-month low while in the bloc's second-largest economy France it dropped further below the breakeven mark.
The drop in euro zone manufacturing activity came despite factories barely increasing prices and, with inflation dropping to a fresh five year low of 0.3 percent in August, that raises risks of the region slipping into deflation.
Both data come just days ahead of a European Central Bank meeting. Although fresh policy action is thought unlikely, the slowdown in growth coupled with rising risks of deflation will increase the pressure for more stimulus. [ECB/INT]
""It reinforces the case for the ECB to keep policy easy. The ECB will likely maintain a dovish tone at this meeting without any action but we expect some details on its plans to implement an asset purchase program in the coming months,"" said Philip Shaw, economist at Investec.
In contrast, the Bank of England and U.S. Federal Reserve are widely expected to begin raising interest rates next year with Britain tipped by analysts as the first mover. [BOE/INT]
But slowing economic activity, smaller price rises and weak pay growth mean those plans are not cast in stone.
The latest CIPS/Markit data for Britain showed factory activity grew at its slowest pace in 14 months despite muted price pressures.
""The survey provided a worrying sign that the manufacturing sector's recovery is struggling to maintain its momentum,"" wrote Paul Hollingsworth, UK economist at Capital Economics.
""In addition, the output balance, which has a fairly good relationship with the official measure of manufacturing output, fell.""
Britain's main manufacturing trade body on Monday cut its growth forecast for 2014 after its members reported a big drop in export orders.
A survey due on Tuesday is likely to show U.S. factory activity also cooled in August but much will also depend on jobs data due on Friday. U.S. employers are expected to have added 220,000 new jobs in August, 11,000 more than in July.
MIXED ASIAN BAG
China's official manufacturing PMI fell from a 27-month high to 51.1 in August, while the HSBC/Markit PMI eased to 50.2.
The fall in overall activity was also driven by job cuts for the 24th consecutive month and highlights the still patchy recovery, increasing speculation of further policy easing.
The People's Bank of China has so far refrained from cutting interest rates, preferring instead to ease liquidity for some banks to free funds for lending. Beijing in turn has tried to ease conditions in the property market.
But China's housing market, which accounts for 15 percent of output, is at the start of what many fear will be a punishing downturn. Future robust economic growth will depend on that downturn being contained.
There were some bright spots in Asia, however.
In India, factory growth eased a touch but chalked up its tenth month of expansion. Last week data showed economic growth quickened to an annual 5.7 percent in the second quarter.
Taiwan's manufacturers reported the strongest expansion in new orders in over three-and-a-half years, much of it for export, lifting the PMI to 56.1 in August.

But South Korea suffered as its exports to China fell in August for a fourth month running, the longest such losing streak in two years, and Indonesia's PMI survey showed activity contracted for the first time in a year.

The Markit U.K. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 52.5 last month from a downwardly revised 54.8 in July. It was the lowest reading since June 2013. Analysts had expected the index to tick up to 55.0.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Growth in new export orders slowed to a five month low, as market uncertainty and increasing geopolitical tensions weighed.
The manufacturing sector continued to create employment for the sixteenth straight month, but the rate of jobs growth slowed to a 14 month low, in line with the trend in output and new orders.
“It is… becoming increasingly evident that U.K. industry is not immune to the impacts of rising geopolitical and global market uncertainty, especially when they affect economic growth and business confidence in our largest trading partner the euro zone,” Rob Dobson, senior economist at survey compiler Markit said.
“It therefore looks as if manufacturing will provide a lesser contribution to the U.K. economic growth story in the third quarter than at the start of the year,” he added.

Factories barely increased prices last month, and manufacturing activity in France fell at the fastest pace in 15 months, in disappointing news for the European Central Bank before Thursday's monetary policy-setting meeting.
Markit's final August manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index came in at 50.7, the lowest in over a year and below both July's 51.8 and an earlier flash estimate of 50.8. Still, August did mark the 14th month the index has been above the 50 line that separates growth from contraction.
An index measuring output, which feeds into a composite PMI due on Wednesday that is seen as a good guide to growth, sank to a 14-month low of 51.0 from July's 52.7 but was just ahead of the flash 50.9.
""Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers is becoming more visible,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have escalated and threaten to damage the region's already fragile recovery.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trade partner in the European Union, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4. In the bloc's second-largest economy of France the PMI fell to 46.9.
""France remains a real concern, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation. Signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands too, is also less than reassuring,"" Dobson said.
""The slowdown in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented.""
The ECB will probably launch a quantitative easing program by March in a bid to prevent deflation and jumpstart economic growth in the region, but it is not expected to change policy on Thursday, a Reuters poll found last week. [ECB/INT]

Prices rose just 0.3 percent last month, the smallest increase since October 2009, and the output price index in the PMI survey was only just above the break-even mark at 50.3. That was above July's 50.1 but below a flash reading of 50.4.

970,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2014 03:50AM ET</span>","Weak investment, trade drive second quarter contraction in German economy","BERLIN (Reuters) - Weak investment spending and slow trade led Germany to contract for the first time in over a year in the second quarter, data showed, suggesting Europe's largest economy is running out of steam just as the impact of the crisis in Ukraine starts to bite.
Germany's Federal Statistics Office confirmed on Monday an earlier estimate showing a 0.2 percent contraction in seasonally-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) on the quarter.
The disappointing performance of an economy once considered the last bastion of growth in a sickly euro zone echoed the region's second and third largest economies, France and Italy, which respectively stagnated and fell back into recession over the same period.
""The second-quarter contraction was a reaction to the strong first quarter so I think we'll return to moderate positive growth in the third ... but there's no shortage of uncertainty factors at the moment,"" said Thilo Heidrich, an economist at Postbank, referring to the standoff between Moscow and the West over Ukraine and the crisis in Iraq.
Gross capital investment in Germany fell by 2.3 percent and construction investment dropped by 4.2 percent, in part due to a mild winter which boosted building activity in the first quarter.
Heidrich said a 0.4 percent drop in plant and equipment spending could be partly due to the Ukraine crisis and sanctions against Russia.
Foreign trade, traditionally the driver of German economic growth, subtracted 0.2 percentage points from growth while private consumption and inventories made a positive contribution.
""The domestic economy will be responsible for growth this year and it's possible that exports will suffer a bit more due to the Ukraine crisis and trade sanctions,"" said Heidrich.
The finance ministry has partly blamed the second-quarter contraction on the Ukraine crisis and sanctions against Russia.
Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has said GDP will probably increase in the remainder of 2014.
But some economists expect the second-quarter weakness to carry through into the third quarter, with the Ifo institute estimating growth will be ""close to zero"" in the third quarter while the DIW institute has warned of the danger of recession.

Recent data has been mixed, with business and investor morale souring while industrial orders have tumbled and joblessness has risen. Exports and output have, however, risen modestly.

The surveys of purchasing managers (PMI) from across Asia told a tale of underwhelming new orders and faltering exports, overshadowing brighter spots such as India and Taiwan.
That was a taster for a feast of euro zone PMIs due later Monday where any weakness would only add to pressure on the European Central Bank to at least open the door to more monetary stimulus at its policy meeting this week.
The Chinese surveys come in both official and private sector flavors. The National Bureau of Statistic's version fell from a 27-month high to 51.1 in August, as factories shed jobs for at least the 24th consecutive month.
More worrying was the HSBC/Markit PMI, which eased to 50.2 in August, only a whisker above the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.
The official survey showed falls across output, employment, new orders, delivery time and raw material inventory, while the private version highlighted subdued demand.
""The economy is healthier than it was in early 2014, but the recovery is tepid and patchy, with housing weakness a weighty anchor on both activity and confidence,"" said Huw McKay, a senior international economist at Westpac in Sydney.
""The authorities would be wise to stay the course with easier policy settings, especially on the fiscal side.""
GOOD AND BAD
The lull in Chinese demand is rippling across the region.
South Korea reported exports to China fell in August for a fourth consecutive month on-year, the longest such losing streak in two years, taking some of the shine off a continued recovery in shipments to the United States and the European Union.
Exports overall dipped 0.1 percent in the month, underscoring a tentative recovery for Asia's fourth-largest economy and leaving the door open for another rate cut before year-end.
""Today's trade data should reinforce the government's cautious view on growth,"" said Raymond Yeung, senior economist at ANZ bank, adding that another rate cut by the Bank of Korea before year-end remains a distinct possibility.
Indonesia's version of the PMI, from HSBC/Markit, showed activity there contracted for the first time in a year in August, weakened by declining new orders and production.
In Japan, the flow of data has shown the economy still suffering the baleful effects of a sales tax hike in April.
Wild swings in consumer spending saw the economy shrink an annualized 6.8 percent in the second quarter, more than erasing the previous quarter's 6.1 percent gain.
VIRTUOUS CYCLE ENDING?
Firms reacted by trimming investment by a seasonally adjusted 1.8 percent in the second quarter, so threatening to end the virtuous cycle of production boosting wages, household income and spending.
Yet there was modestly promising news on industrial activity for August. The final Markit/JMMA Japan Manufacturing PMI held at a relatively firm 52.2 in August, up from 50.5 in July.
Also encouraging was activity in Taiwan, which continues to benefit mightily from being a key cog in Apple's (O:AAPL) supply chain.
Taiwan's manufacturers enjoyed the strongest expansion of new orders in over three-and-a-half years, much of it for export, lifting the PMI to a lofty 56.1 in August.
India was another standout as its PMI eased a touch to 52.4 in August but chalked up the tenth straight month of expansion. The country surprised last week by reporting economic growth quickened to an annual 5.7 percent in the second quarter.
""Output and new orders slowed slightly in August, but remained robust relative to their 12-month history,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.

""The mood remains positive too, with firms accumulating inventory in response to stronger demand,"" he added.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 01, 2014 12:10AM ET</span>",China's official PMI slips to 51.1 in August,"BEIJING (Reuters) - An index of growth in China's vast manufacturing sector fell from a 27-month high to 51.1 in August, a government study showed on Monday, slightly less than forecast and adding to signs of growing softness in the Chinese economy.
China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) slipped in August from July's 51.7, the National Bureau of Statistics said, slightly missing the median forecast of 51.2 in a Reuters poll.
A breakdown of the survey showed output, employment, new orders, delivery time and raw material inventory all fell across the board, with the labor market showing the most weakness.
The employment sub-index slipped to a three-month low of 48.2 in August, below the 50-point mark that separates growth in activity from a contraction.
An output sub-index slipped to 53.2 from July's 54.2, while new orders fell to 52.5 from July's 53.6.
The broad retreat across all sub-indices underscores rising concerns that the world's second-largest economy may be stumbling again.
The economy has had a rocky spell this year. Growth sank to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter before edging up to 7.5 between April and June.
Hopes that the mild rebound may gain traction were battered last month when growth in retail sales and fixed asset investment slowed, while money injected into the economy unexpectedly tumbled to a near six-year low.
Cooling activity has hurt factories across China.
More Chinese manufacturers are falling behind on their payments as economic growth falters, causing accounts receivable to spike 1.1 trillion yuan ($179 billion) in the first six months from the year-ago period, the government said last month.
But Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, cautioned against an overly pessimistic response to Monday's official reading on manufacturing activity.

Although the PMI retreated in August from July, it is still the second-highest reading struck this year, Zhao said.

983,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 29, 2014 01:15PM ET</span>",Brazil's Economy Tumbles Into Recession ,"By Meagan Clark - Brazil’s economy has slid into recession for the first time in more than five years, ahead of the October presidential election, as lower confidence erodes investment. Economic activity shrank by 0.6 percent from April to June compared to the previous three-month period, the Brazilian government’s statistics agency reported Friday.
Economists polled by Bloomberg had expected only a 0.4 percent quarter-to-quarter drop. Gross domestic product, the measure of all goods and services produced, fell 0.9 percent in the second quarter compared to a year ago.
A 5.3 percent drop in investment over the second quarter drove the fall, though government spending also fell, and consumer spending remains weak at 0.25 percent growth over the quarter after a 0.2 percent fall in the first quarter.
The news comes after Latin America’s largest economy shrank by 1.5 percent in June, the fifth straight monthly decline and the worst since summer 2013, despite the tourism attracted by the World Cup. And growth in the first quarter was recently revised to a 0.2 percent fall from an initially estimated 0.2 percent rise.

The recession adds pressure on Brazil’s central bank to reduce the required amount banks must hold rather than lend out, or reduce interest rates to lower borrowing costs and put more spending power into businesses’ and consumers’ hands. It also adds pressure to President Dilma Rousseff, running for re-election, and her contenders Aécio Neves and Marina Silva to talk up economic reforms.
“We suspect that policy stimulus [from the central bank] would risk doing more harm than good,” Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note Friday. “Instead, the key to reviving growth lies in whether the winner of October’s presidential election can implement much-needed reforms.”"
984,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2014 11:30AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer spending dips; confidence at seven-year high,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending fell in July for the first time in six months, but a rise in confidence among households in August to a seven-year high suggested the retrenchment was likely temporary.
Other data on Friday showed a sharp acceleration in factory activity in the Midwest, underscoring the economy's relatively strong fundamentals.
""Strong labor market gains and consumer confidence at cycle highs should continue to support spending in the coming months, helping GDP growth average 3 percent or higher in the latter half of the year,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, a U.S. economist at TD Securities in New York.
Consumer spending dipped 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in June, the Commerce Department said.
Economists had expected consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, to increase 0.2 percent. When adjusted for inflation, it slipped 0.2 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in June.
Spending was weighed down by declines in automobile purchases, while a mild July reduced demand for utilities. Households also cut back on other items.
The weakness in consumer spending at the start of the third quarter poses a downward risk to growth estimates for the period. Most economists, however, still expect another quarter of sturdy growth, citing strong consumer confidence, as well as solid growth in employment, manufacturing and business spending.
Other sectors such as housing and government spending are also on the mend.
Separately, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index increased to 82.5 in August, the highest since July 2007, from 81.8 in July.
""It's consistent with continued moderate growth in consumer spending,"" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays in New York.
Consumer spending rose at a 2.5 percent annual pace in the second quarter, helping to lift the economy to a 4.2 percent growth rate.
SAVINGS RISE
Spending is lagging income gains but economists expect it to catch up. Income last month rose 0.2 percent after increasing 0.5 percent in June.
With households cutting back on spending, savings hit their highest level since December 2012. Rising savings also bode well for future spending.
Weak consumer spending left inflation pressures muted in July, giving the Federal Reserve room to keep its benchmark overnight lending rate near zero for some time while it awaits an acceleration in wage growth.
A price index for consumer spending edged up 0.1 percent after increasing 0.2 percent in June. That was the smallest rise since February. In the 12 months through July, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose 1.6 percent. It also increased by 1.6 percent in June.
Excluding food and energy, prices inched up 0.1 percent after rising by the same margin in June.
The so-called core PCE, which is the Fed's favorite inflation measure, increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through July, continuing to run below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. It had advanced 1.5 percent in June.

In a third report, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago said its business barometer shot up to 64.3 this month from 52.6 in July. It was the index's biggest monthly point gain since July 1983 and pointed to continued strength in the manufacturing sector.

985,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 29, 2014 10:10AM ET</span>",U.S. consumer sentiment rises in final August reading,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment rose in August, while an index of current economic conditions hit its highest since July 2007, a survey released on Friday showed.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final August reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 82.5, up from 81.8 the month before.
It was above the the median forecast of 80.1 among economists polled by Reuters.
""Consumer confidence rebounded in late August due to a positive reassessment of prospects for the national economy,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
""A weakened trend in equity and home prices in the absence of resurgent wages would threaten the modest pace of consumer spending that is now expected.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 99.8 from 97.4, marking its highest level since July 2007 and above a forecast of 99.5.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations slipped for a fourth straight month, to 71.3 from 71.8, marking its lowest level since March but above an expected 67.0.

The survey's one-year inflation expectation fell to 3.2 percent from 3.3 percent, while the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook was at 2.9 percent, up from 2.7 percent.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 28, 2014 11:40PM ET</span>","Japan household spending slumps, output flat as tax pain persists","By Leika Kihara and Stanley White TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese household spending fell much more than expected and factory output remained weak in July after plunging in June, government data showed, suggesting that soft exports and a sales tax hike in April may drag on the economy longer than expected.
While the Bank of Japan is in no mood to expand monetary stimulus any time soon, the data undermines the BOJ's rosy economic forecasts and will keep it under pressure to act if the economy fails to gather momentum, analysts say.
The soft readings may also fuel speculation that the government could delay a second sales tax increase scheduled for next year, or try to compile another fiscal stimulus package, which would further worsen Japan's debt burden.
""Production and consumption are both stagnating, and the economy is clearly undershooting projections of the government and the BOJ,"" said Taro Saito, senior economist at NLI Research Institute.
""The BOJ will be forced to cut its economic view sooner or later, although it is unlikely to move anytime soon as it argues for rising inflation.""
Household spending fell 5.9 percent in July from a year earlier, nearly double the drop forecast in a Reuters poll, as the higher levy and bad weather kept consumers at home instead of going out shopping.
Weak exports left companies with a huge pile of inventories, forcing them to continue cutting back on factory output, separate data showed.
Industrial output rose 0.2 percent in July, much less than a 1.0 percent increase projected in a Reuters poll, data by the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade showed. That was a tepid rebound from a 3.4 percent fall in June, the fastest drop since the March 2011 earthquake.
Manufacturers expect output to rise 1.3 percent in August and 3.5 percent in September. But a ministry official told a briefing there was uncertainty on whether production will rise as companies had continued to overestimate their outlook plans.
Most industries, except for makers of industrial machinery, cut output in July and an index gauging inventory hit the highest level since November 2012, underscoring the view the post-tax slump in consumption was bigger than expected.
Analysts expect factory output in July-September to fall from the previous quarter, suggesting that any rebound in the economy will be modest and casting doubt on the BOJ's view the recovery will be strong enough to lift inflation to 2 percent.
""The BOJ says now that output is rising as a trend, but I think it's hard to continue saying so with today's data as output has been falling after peaking in January,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The economy is still recovering, so the BOJ will probably hold off on easing this year. But if data continues to remain weak, it might be forced into action,"" he said.
ROSY VIEW IN DOUBT
The BOJ is likely to keep monetary policy steady and stick to its view that the economy is recovering moderately when it meets for a rate review next week, though pessimists in the board may argue for more downbeat language in describing consumption and output, given Friday's weak data.
The soft data also complicates Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's decision on whether to proceed with the next proposed sales tax hike in October 2015, to 10 percent from 8 percent.
Analysts generally expect Abe to approve another tax hike in December, but that decision promises to be politically divisive, coming just as the government hammers out details of a promised corporate tax cut.
Economics Minister Akira Amari told reporters after the data there was no need to be so pessimistic about household spending, while Finance Minister Taro Aso said that the impact of April's sales tax hike on the economy is gradually easing but it needs close monitoring from now on.
Despite weak signs in the economy, the BOJ is optimistic that a tightening job market will lead to higher wages and more income for households to spend, thereby keeping Japan on track to meet its 2 percent inflation target.
The jobless rate rose to 3.8 percent in July from June's 3.7 percent but the jobs-to-applicants ratio remained at a 22-year high of 1.10, a good omen for the BOJ.
Data due next week on employee wages and the manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) will offer further clues to whether domestic demand will weaken further or gain momentum.
Separate data showed core consumer inflation, which excludes volatile prices of fresh foods but includes oil products, hit 3.3 percent in the year to July, matching a median market forecast. When excluding the effect of the April tax hike, it stood at 1.3 percent, still distant from the 2 percent inflation target the Bank of Japan pledged to meet sometime next year.
Japan's economy shrank at an annualized 6.8 percent in the second quarter from the previous three months, more than erasing the 6.1 percent first-quarter surge in the run-up to the sales tax hike.

Many analysts agree with the BOJ that growth will rebound in the current quarter, though some warn that the recovery may falter later this year if the tax-hike pain is prolonged and exports fail to emerge from the doldrums.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the second quarter with a bigger chunk of the growth driven by domestic demand in a bright sign for the future. 
Gross domestic product expanded at a 4.2 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 4.0 percent pace, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. 
Both business spending and exports were revised higher, while a buildup in business inventories was smaller than previously estimated - a mix of growth that provides a stronger underpinning for the remainder of the year. 
Separate reports showing a second straight weekly decline in the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits and a jump in home purchase contracts also suggested underlying momentum in the economy. 
""The economy is in good shape and getting better,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
While the economy shrank at a 2.1 percent rate in the first quarter, economists expect growth of around 2 percent for the year as a whole, with GDP expanding about 3 percent in 2015. 
The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies on the data, but U.S. stocks were down as traders kept a wary eye on Ukraine, which accused Russian forces of entering the country. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose as the troubles in Ukraine triggered flight-to-safety bids. 
One report on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless aid slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 298,000 last week. 
In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales index, which leads home resales by a month or two, jumped 3.3 percent to an 11-month high in July. It was the latest sign the housing market recovery was back on track after faltering in the second half of 2013. 
Growth in the second quarter was broad-based, with consumer and business spending, exports, homebuilding and even government contributing. Domestic demand rose at its fastest pace in four years, pointing to a recovery that was becoming more durable after the first-quarter's weather-induced slump. 
Still, the data was unlikely to lead the Federal Reserve to bring forward the timing of interest rates hikes as slack still exists in the labor market and inflation will likely remain below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. 
""We still have a long way to go. Hence, the Fed remains cautious about how rapidly it will raise rates when they start,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. 
Economists had expected the second-quarter GDP growth pace would be revised down to 3.9 percent. 
RISING INCOME 
Gross domestic income, which measures the income side of the growth ledger, surged at a 4.7 percent rate, consistent with strong job gains during the quarter. That was the fastest increase since the first quarter of 2012. 
While first-quarter growth in household disposable income was revised down, the second quarter estimate was more robust than previously reported - a good omen for future spending. 
At the same time, after-tax corporate profits rebounded from a decline to hit a three-year high, and business spending on equipment and nonresidential structures, such as gas drilling, was revised sharply higher. 
The amount of stock accumulated by businesses was a bit less than initially reported, reducing the estimated contribution of inventories to GDP growth to 1.39 percentage points from 1.66 percentage points. 
The relatively smaller inventory build means less stock overhang, which bodes well for third-quarter GDP growth. 

While trade was a drag for a second consecutive quarter, export growth was raised to its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2010.

Sales volumes rose particularly strongly among grocers, chemists and furniture & carpet retailers, but specialist food & drink retailers recorded a fall in sales volumes.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 26, 2014 09:10AM ET</span>",Aircraft demand spurs record U.S. durable goods orders gain,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods posted their biggest gain on record in July on strong international demand for aircraft, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a steady pace of domestic economic growth. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday durable goods orders, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, jumped 22.6 percent last month after an upwardly revised 2.7 percent increase in June. 
July's increase was the largest on record and far outpaced economists' forecasts for a 7.5 percent advance. Orders were previously reported to have gained 0.7 percent in June. 
Transportation orders rose 74.2 percent, the biggest increase ever, boosted by a surge in bookings for civilian aircraft, which soared 318 percent, the largest increase since January 2011. 
U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data. 
Boeing (N:BA) reported on its website that it had received 324 aircraft orders in July, triple the number booked in June. 
Many of the orders, including 150 planes by Emirates , the Dubai-based airline, were for expensive models, some still under development. It will take at least 10 years for the resulting increase in production to filter through to gross domestic product. 
Orders for autos increased 10.2 percent, a sign of firming manufacturing activity, after declining 1.3 percent in June. Excluding the volatile transportation category, durable goods orders fell 0.8 percent after rising 3.0 percent in June. 
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, slipped 0.5 percent last month. 
The decline, however, followed an upwardly revised 5.4 percent advance in June. So-called core capital goods orders remained consistent with expectations of steady economic growth in the third quarter. 
Data ranging from employment to manufacturing suggest growth in the July-September quarter is currently running at around a 3.0 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 4.0 percent rate in the second quarter. 
Core capital goods orders were previously reported to have increased 3.3 percent in June. 
Core capital goods shipments increased 1.5 percent in July. Shipments of core capital goods are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's GDP measurement. 
Other details of the report favor manufacturing in the months ahead. 
Unfilled orders for core capital goods increased 1.1 percent last month after rising 1.7 percent in June, showing a steady pipeline of work that will keep the nation's factories busy for a while. 

Durable goods inventories rose 0.5 percent in July, matching the gain in the prior month, suggesting inventory accumulation could add to third-quarter growth after helping to boost output in the second quarter.

The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas declined 0.2 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis. A Reuters poll of economists had forecast a flat reading.
Non-seasonally adjusted prices rose 1.0 percent in the 20 cities, in line with expectations.

Prices in the 20 cities rose 8.1 percent year over year, shy of expectations for 8.4 percent.
A broader measure of national housing market activity that Case-Shiller is now releasing on a monthly basis rose at a slower pace year over year, coming in at 6.2 percent. Previously, Case-Shiller had released its national index on a quarterly basis.
The seasonally adjusted 10-city gauge fell 0.1 percent in June versus a 0.2 percent decline in May, while the non-adjusted 10-city index rose 1.0 percent in June compared to a 1.1 percent rise in May.

1082,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 22, 2014 11:00AM ET</span>",Janet Yellen Says US Economy Is Inching Closer To Federal Reserve Goals,"By Meagan Clark -

The U.S. economy is getting closer to its objectives of high employment and low inflation, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said in a speech Friday, indicating the central bank could raise interest rates sooner than economists previously expected.
Yellen said the Fed is now questioning how much slack remains in the labor market, or how many job searchers relative to jobs exist, affecting wage growth, and disputing the timing of rate hikes relative to that slack. 
If the Fed believes the economy’s growth and hiring will pick up and inflation will rise to a normal 2 percent, the central bank would likely pull back further on its easy money policies, purchasing government bonds to keep stock prices up, and may hike the interest rate it authorizes banks to charge each other for lending, raising borrowing costs for consumers on everything from homes to cars. But if the Fed overestimates the economy’s strength and pulls back too soon, it would halt an already weak housing recovery and send unemployment skyrocketing.
But Yellen also said it's difficult to measure the labor market slack, and that the Fed's data on the labor market suggest that the unemployment rate, which has been steadily but gradually falling, may be overstating progress.
Yellen's predecessor Ben Bernanke helped turn the annual meeting into a policy-shifting event through his speeches. Market-watchers are hanging on her words to pick up any hints about when the Fed will raise interest rates. Before the meeting, economists had predicted early 2015 to fall 2015.
Minutes of a July Fed meeting released Thursday show that most Fed officials agree that more data is needed to decide on the timing of an interest rate hike.  
Full Text of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's remarks on labor markets as prepared for delivery at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank's Jackson Hole conference:
""In the five years since the end of the Great Recession, the economy has made considerable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of employment in the United States since the Great Depression.1 More jobs have now been created in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May of this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008. Job gains in 2014 have averaged 230,000 a month, up from the 190,000 a month pace during the preceding two years. The unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent in July, has declined nearly 4 percentage points from its late 2009 peak. Over the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace. These developments are encouraging, but it speaks to the depth of the damage that, five years after the end of the recession, the labor market has yet to fully recover.
The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy objective is to foster maximum employment and price stability. In this regard, a key challenge is to assess just how far the economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal. Judgments concerning the size of that gap are complicated by ongoing shifts in the structure of the labor market and the possibility that the severe recession caused persistent changes in the labor market’s functioning.
These and other questions about the labor market are central to the conduct of monetary policy, so I am pleased that the organizers of this year’s symposium chose labor market dynamics as its theme. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I look to the presentations and discussions over the next two days for insights into possible changes that are affecting the labor market. I expect, however, that our understanding of labor market developments and their potential implications for inflation will remain far from perfect. As a consequence, monetary policy ultimately must be conducted in a pragmatic manner that relies not on any particular indicator or model, but instead reflects an ongoing assessment of a wide range of information in the context of our ever-evolving understanding of the economy.
The Labor Market Recovery and Monetary Policy
In my remarks this morning, I will review a number of developments related to the functioning of the labor market that have made it more difficult to judge the remaining degree of slack. Differing interpretations of these developments affect judgments concerning the appropriate path of monetary policy. Before turning to the specifics, however, I would like to provide some context concerning the role of the labor market in shaping monetary policy over the past several years. During that time, the FOMC has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy in pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The Committee judged such a stance appropriate because inflation has fallen short of our 2 percent objective while the labor market, until recently, operated very far from any reasonable definition of maximum employment.
The FOMC’s current program of asset purchases began when the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent and progress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than desired. The Committee’s objective was to achieve a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and as progress toward this goal has materialized, we have reduced our pace of asset purchases and expect to complete this program in October. In addition, in December 2012, the Committee modified its forward guidance for the federal funds rate, stating that “as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored,” the Committee would not even consider raising the federal funds rate above the 0 to 1/4 percent range.2 This “threshold based” forward guidance was deemed appropriate under conditions in which inflation was subdued and the economy remained unambiguously far from maximum employment.
Earlier this year, however, with the unemployment rate declining faster than had been anticipated and nearing the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the FOMC recast its forward guidance, stating that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”3 As the recovery progresses, assessments of the degree of remaining slack in the labor market need to become more nuanced because of considerable uncertainty about the level of employment consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate. Indeed, in its 2012 statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, the FOMC explicitly recognized that factors determining maximum employment “may change over time and may not be directly measurable,” and that assessments of the level of maximum employment “are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.”4 Accordingly, the reformulated forward guidance reaffirms the FOMC’s view that policy decisions will not be based on any single indicator, but will instead take into account a wide range of information on the labor market, as well as inflation and financial developments.
Interpreting Labor Market Surprises: Past and Future
The assessment of labor market slack is rarely simple and has been especially challenging recently. Estimates of slack necessitate difficult judgments about the magnitudes of the cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables, including labor force participation, the extent of part-time employment for economic reasons, and labor market flows, such as the pace of hires and quits. A considerable body of research suggests that the behavior of these and other labor market variables has changed since the Great Recession.6 Along with cyclical influences, significant structural factors have affected the labor market, including the aging of the workforce and other demographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynamism in the labor market, and the phenomenon of “polarization”--that is, the reduction in the relative number of middle-skill jobs.7
Consider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate, which has declined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has fallen. As a consequence, the employment-to-population ratio has increased far less over the past several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate, based on past experience. For policymakers, the key question is: What portion of the decline in labor force participation reflects structural shifts and what portion reflects cyclical weakness in the labor market? If the cyclical component is abnormally large, relative to the unemployment rate, then it might be seen as an additional contributor to labor market slack.
Labor force participation peaked in early 2000, so its decline began well before the Great Recession. A portion of that decline clearly relates to the aging of the baby boom generation. But the pace of decline accelerated with the recession. As an accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be attributed to increases in four factors: retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, including worker discouragement.8 Of these, greater worker discouragement is most directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably expect further increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the workforce. Indeed, the flattening out of the labor force participation rate since late last year could partly reflect discouraged workers rejoining the labor force in response to the significant improvements that we have seen in labor market conditions. If so, the cyclical shortfall in labor force participation may have diminished.
What is more difficult to determine is whether some portion of the increase in disability rates, retirements, and school enrollments since the Great Recession reflects cyclical forces. While structural factors have clearly and importantly affected each of these three trends, some portion of the decline in labor force participation resulting from these trends could be related to the recession and slow recovery and therefore might reverse in a stronger labor market.9 Disability applications and educational enrollments typically are affected by cyclical factors, and existing evidence suggests that the elevated levels of both may partly reflect perceptions of poor job prospects.10 Moreover, the rapid pace of retirements over the past few years might reflect some degree of pull-forward of future retirements in the face of a weak labor market. If so, retirements might contribute less to declining participation in the period ahead than would otherwise be expected based on the aging workforce.11
A second factor bearing on estimates of labor market slack is the elevated number of workers who are employed part time but desire full-time work (those classified as “part time for economic reasons”). At nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of such workers is notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typical historically, providing another reason why the current level of the unemployment rate may understate the amount of remaining slack in the labor market. Again, however, some portion of the rise in involuntary part-time work may reflect structural rather than cyclical factors. For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from goods production and toward services, a sector which historically has used a greater portion of part-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs. Likewise, the continuing decline of middle-skill jobs, some of which could be replaced by part-time jobs, may raise the share of part-time jobs in overall employment.12 Despite these challenges in assessing where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons may settle in the long run, the sharp run-up in involuntary part-time employment during the recession and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant.
Private sector labor market flows provide additional indications of the strength of the labor market. For example, the quits rate has tended to be pro-cyclical, since more workers voluntarily quit their jobs when they are more confident about their ability to find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires. Indeed, the quits rate has picked up with improvements in the labor market over the past year, but it still remains somewhat depressed relative to its level before the recession. A significant increase in job openings over the past year suggests notable improvement in labor market conditions, but the hiring rate has only partially recovered from its decline during the recession. Given the rise in job vacancies, hiring may be poised to pick up, but the failure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the prospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls. Alternatively, subdued hiring could indicate that firms are encountering difficulties in finding qualified job applicants. As is true of the other indicators I have discussed, labor market flows tend to reflect not only cyclical but also structural changes in the economy. Indeed, these flows may provide evidence of reduced labor market dynamism, which could prove quite persistent.13 That said, the balance of evidence leads me to conclude that weak aggregate demand has contributed significantly to the depressed levels of quits and hires during the recession and in the recovery.
One convenient way to summarize the information contained in a large number of indicators is through the use of so-called factor models. Following this methodology, Federal Reserve Board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor market indicators, including four I just discussed.14 This broadly based metric supports the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat overstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions.
Finally, changes in labor compensation may also help shed light on the degree of labor market slack, although here, too, there are significant challenges in distinguishing between cyclical and structural influences. Over the past several years, wage inflation, as measured by several different indexes, has averaged about 2 percent, and there has been little evidence of any broad-based acceleration in either wages or compensation. Indeed, in real terms, wages have been about flat, growing less than labor productivity. This pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation. And, since wage movements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than would be indicated by the current unemployment rate.
There are three reasons, however, why we should be cautious in drawing such a conclusion. First, the sluggish pace of nominal and real wage growth in recent years may reflect the phenomenon of “pent-up wage deflation.”15 The evidence suggests that many firms faced significant constraints in lowering compensation during the recession and the earlier part of the recovery because of “downward nominal wage rigidity”--namely, an inability or unwillingness on the part of firms to cut nominal wages. To the extent that firms faced limits in reducing real and nominal wages when the labor market was exceptionally weak, they may find that now they do not need to raise wages to attract qualified workers. As a result, wages might rise relatively slowly as the labor market strengthens. If pent-up wage deflation is holding down wage growth, the current very moderate wage growth could be a misleading signal of the degree of remaining slack. Further, wages could begin to rise at a noticeably more rapid pace once pent-up wage deflation has been absorbed.
Second, wage developments reflect not only cyclical but also secular trends that have likely affected the evolution of labor’s share of income in recent years. As I noted, real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity, implying that real unit labor costs have been declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to accelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure. However, research suggests that the decline in real unit labor costs may partly reflect secular factors that predate the recession, including changing patterns of production and international trade, as well as measurement issues.16 If so, productivity growth could continue to outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its potential.
A third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility that, because of the dislocations of the Great Recession, transitory wage and price pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached, although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum employment.17 The argument is that workers who have suffered long-term unemployment--along with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but would return to work in a stronger economy--face significant impediments to reemployment. In this case, further improvement in the labor market could entail stronger wage pressures for a time before maximum employment has been attained.18
Implications of Labor Market Developments for Monetary Policy
The focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor market and how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of determining the state of the economy relative to the FOMC’s objective of maximum employment. In my remaining time, I will turn to the special challenges that these difficulties in assessing the labor market pose for evaluating the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
Any discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. For much of the past five years, the FOMC has been confronted with an obvious and substantial degree of slack in the labor market and significant risks of slipping into persistent below-target inflation. In such circumstances, the need for extraordinary accommodation is unambiguous, in my view.
However, with the economy getting closer to our objectives, the FOMC’s emphasis is naturally shifting to questions about the degree of remaining slack, how quickly that slack is likely to be taken up, and thereby to the question of under what conditions we should begin dialing back our extraordinary accommodation. As should be evident from my remarks so far, I believe that our assessments of the degree of slack must be based on a wide range of variables and will require difficult judgments about the cyclical and structural influences in the labor market. While these assessments have always been imprecise and subject to revision, the task has become especially challenging in the aftermath of the Great Recession, which brought nearly unprecedented cyclical dislocations and may have been associated with similarly unprecedented structural changes in the labor market--changes that have yet to be fully understood.
So, what is a monetary policymaker to do? Some have argued that, in light of the uncertainties associated with estimating labor market slack, policymakers should focus mainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy. To take an extreme case, if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation, we could largely ignore labor market indicators and look instead at the behavior of inflation to determine the extent of slack in the labor market. In present circumstances, with inflation still running below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, such an approach would suggest that we could maintain policy accommodation until inflation is clearly moving back toward 2 percent, at which point we could also be confident that slack had diminished.
Of course, our task is not nearly so straightforward. Historically, slack has accounted for only a small portion of the fluctuations in inflation. Indeed, unusual aspects of the current recovery may have shifted the lead-lag relationship between a tightening labor market and rising inflation pressures in either direction. For example, as I discussed earlier, if downward nominal wage rigidities created a stock of pent-up wage deflation during the economic downturn, observed wage and price pressures associated with a given amount of slack or pace of reduction in slack might be unusually low for a time. If so, the first clear signs of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the progression toward maximum employment. As a result, maintaining a high degree of monetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could, in this case, unduly delay the removal of accommodation, necessitating an abrupt and potentially disruptive tightening of policy later on.
Conversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years--such as depressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a still-substantial level of long-term unemployment--may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than usual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines. However, some of the resulting wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers back into the labor force and lower long-term unemployment.19 As a consequence, tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in this case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consistent with the dual mandate.
Inferring the degree of resource utilization from real-time readings on inflation is further complicated by the familiar challenge of distinguishing transitory price changes from persistent price pressures. Indeed, the recent firming of inflation toward our 2 percent goal appears to reflect a combination of both factors.
These complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation pressures in the current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the FOMC will be grappling with as the recovery continues. There is no simple recipe for appropriate policy in this context, and the FOMC is particularly attentive to the need to clearly describe the policy framework we are using to meet these challenges. As the FOMC has noted in its recent policy statements, the stance of policy will be guided by our assessments of how far we are from our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of progress toward those objectives.
At the FOMC’s most recent meeting, the Committee judged, based on a range of labor market indicators, that “labor market conditions improved.”20 Indeed, as I noted earlier, they have improved more rapidly than the Committee had anticipated. Nevertheless, the Committee judged that underutilization of labor resources still remains significant. Given this assessment and the Committee’s expectation that inflation will gradually move up toward its longer-run objective, the Committee reaffirmed its view “that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”21 But if progress in the labor market continues to be more rapid than anticipated by the Committee or if inflation moves up more rapidly than anticipated, resulting in faster convergence toward our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than the Committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter. Of course, if economic performance turns out to be disappointing and progress toward our goals proceeds more slowly than we expect, then the future path of interest rates likely would be more accommodative than we currently anticipate. As I have noted many times, monetary policy is not on a preset path. The Committee will be closely monitoring incoming information on the labor market and inflation in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy.
Overall, I suspect that many of the labor market issues you will be discussing at this conference will be at the center of FOMC discussions for some time to come. I thank you in advance for the insights you will offer and encourage you to continue the important research that advances our understanding of cyclical and structural labor market issues."""

1088,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 21, 2014 02:15PM ET</span>",Fewer People Filed Jobless Claims In July; Home Sales Up,"By Reuters -

(Reuters) - U.S. home resales rose to a 10-month high in July and the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, signaling strength in the economy early in the third quarter.   The growth outlook was further buoyed by other reports on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region hit its highest level since March 2011 in August while a gauge of future economic activity increased solidly last month.   The National Association of Realtors said existing home sales increased 2.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.15 million units. That was the highest reading since last September and confounded economists' expectations for a pullback.   Home resales have now increased for four straight months after the housing market recovery stalled in the second half of 2013 following a run-up in mortgage rates.   ""It goes some way in allaying fears about a relapse in the housing sector recovery, which until recently appears to have stagnated,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.   In a separate report, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 298,000 for the week ended Aug. 16. That pointed to a sustained improvement in labor market conditions.   The four-week average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 4,750 to 300,750. But at that level it is consistent with solid job growth and claims are back to pre-recession levels.   U.S. stocks were trading higher, with the S&P 500 index .SPX hitting an intraday record. The housing index .HGX was up 0.27 percent, with Pulte Group (PHM.N) gaining 0.26 percent.   The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies .DXY while prices for U.S. Treasury debt US10YT=RR rose marginally.   FIRMING LABOR MARKET   The jobless claims report covered the period during which the government surveyed employers for August's nonfarm payrolls data. The four-week average of claims fell 8,500 between the July and August survey periods, suggesting another month of relatively strong job gains.   Nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 in July, marking the sixth consecutive month that job growth topped 200,000, a sign of strength last seen in 1997. The firming jobs picture appears to have caught policymakers by surprise.   Minutes of the Federal Reserve's July 29–30 policy meeting published on Wednesday showed officials viewing the improvement in labor market conditions as ""greater than anticipated"" and hinted that that could lead to an early interest rate increase.   The U.S. central bank had previously termed labor market slack ""significant"" but the minutes showed many policymakers thought this characterization ""might have to change before long.""   The Fed has held its benchmark interest rate near zero since December 2008. The economy grew at a 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter. Growth estimates for the third quarter are currently around a 3 percent pace.   In a third report, financial data firm Markit said its preliminary or 'flash' U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 58 this month, the highest since April 2010, from 55.8 in July.   That show of strength was corroborated by a separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, which showed its business activity index increased to 28.0 this month, the highest since March 2011, from 23.9 in July. Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing.   ""Overall, today's Philly Fed and Markit manufacturing surveys indicate continued healthy growth in the manufacturing sector in August,"" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays in New York.   A fifth report from the Conference Board showed its Leading Economic Index increased 0.9 percent last month after advancing 0.6 percent in June.   (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani Additional reporting by Jason Lange in Washington and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and James Dalgleish)      "

1101,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2014 04:20AM ET</span>","Euro zone business growth slows in August, prices fall: PMI","By Jonathan Cable LONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Euro zone private business growth slowed more than expected this month, despite widespread price cutting, as manufacturing and service industry activity both dwindled, a survey showed on Thursday.
Euro zone economic growth ground to a halt in the second, quarter, dragged down by a shrinking economy in Germany and a stagnant France, even before any impact from sanctions imposed on and by Russia over Ukraine.
Markit's Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) will provide gloomy reading for the European Central Bank (ECB), suggesting its two biggest economies are struggling like smaller members.
Based on surveys of thousands of companies across the region and a good indicator of overall growth, the Composite Flash PMI fell to 52.8 from July's 53.8, far short of expectations in a Reuters poll for a modest dip to 53.4.
However, readings above 50 still indicate expansion. Markit said the data point to third-quarter economic growth of 0.3 percent, matching predictions from a Reuters poll last week.
""We are not seeing a recovery taking real hold as yet. We are not seeing anything where we look at it and think 'yes, this is the point where the euro zone has come out of all its difficulties',"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The euro zone has also yet to feel the full effect of escalating tensions with Russia. Europe stung Moscow with economic sanctions, prompting a
tit-for-tat response from Russian President Vladimir Putin, over the Kremlin's support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.
The composite PMI in Germany - Russia's biggest trade partner in the European Union which has already seen exports to the country plunge in the first half of the year - fell to 54.9 from 55.7.
For France, the euro zone's second largest economy, the Composite PMI rose from 49.4 to the break-even mark at 50.
PRICES FALL

Consumer prices in the euro zone rose just 0.4 percent on the year in July, the weakest annual rise since October 2009 at the height of the financial crisis, and well within the ECB's ""danger zone"" of below 1 percent.
Worryingly, according to the composite output price index firms cut prices for the 29th month - and at a faster rate than
in July. It dipped to 48.9 from 49.0.
Also of concern, suggesting factories do not expect things to improve anytime soon, manufacturing headcount fell at the fastest rate in nine months. The sub-index dropped to 49.1 from 49.9.
Optimism about the future also sank among services firms - the business expectations index plummeted to 58.6 from 61.7, its
lowest reading in a year.
The manufacturing PMI fell to 50.8 from 51.8, below the consensus forecast for 51.3 and its lowest since July 2013. The output index, which is used to calculate the composite PMI, sank to 50.9 from 52.7. The services PMI fell in line with expectations to 53.5 from 54.2.

1107,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2014 01:50AM ET</span>","China, Japan August factory surveys signal economic softness ","By Xiaoyi Shao and Tetsushi Kajimoto 
BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - China's manufacturing activity hit a three-month low in August, raising the case for fresh policy steps to keep growth on track, while a Reuters poll showed Japan's economic recovery is likely to be modest despite a small acceleration in the factory sector. 
Surveys conducted by HSBC/Markit and Reuters highlighted fragility in recovery of the world's second- and third-largest economies at a time when policymakers try to walk a fine line between supporting growth and pushing structural changes. 
The HSBC/Markit Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 in August from July's 18-month high of 51.7, badly missing a Reuters forecast of 51.5 but still hovering above the 50 threshold that separates expansion from contraction. 
""The sharp drop in the PMI is perhaps not surprising given last month's disappointing activity and lending data. That said, we are not expecting a rapid deterioration in economic momentum,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. 
""Meanwhile, we expect the government to continue to fine tune policy as necessary to prevent growth from slipping too much over the coming quarters."" 
Most Asian stock markets, including Hong Kong and China, extended early losses after the PMI survey while the Australian dollar , often used as a liquid proxy for bets on China, fell. 
A burst of policy stimulus steps since April lifted China's annual economic growth to 7.5 percent in the second quarter - in line with the full-year official growth target - from 7.4 percent in the first quarter - the weakest pace in 18 months. 
But with conditions looking increasingly unsteady into the third quarter as policy support moderated, some analysts say even more stimulus may be needed in coming months to bolster growth and offset the downdraft from the housing market. 
A sharp drop in bank lending and fiscal spending in July underscored fear that banks may be increasingly reluctant to extend credit, particularly to private companies, as bad loans continue to rise and asset quality deteriorates. 
More policy steps may be needed, but analysts also caution against high expectations given that China's reform-minded leaders have shown greater tolerance for slower growth and ruled out large-scale policy stimulus. 
""Definitely there will be more measures to keep growth momentum steady in coming months,"" said Zhu Qibing, an economist at Minzu Securities in Beijing. ""But we don't expect interest rate cuts in the near term as the central bank has reiterated that it would keep its prudent monetary policy unchanged."" 
An abrupt drop in credit in July has strengthened the case for rate cuts, but policy insiders believe it will be reluctant to take more aggressive steps and for now will stick with more targeted measures. 
China has relaxed monetary policy since April by easing controls in the property market, accelerating the construction of some infrastructure works, and relaxing reserve requirements for small banks to boost lending. 
MODEST RECOVERY IN JAPAN 
A similar survey on Japan showed factory activity accelerated in August as export and domestic demand increased, in another sign the economy is steadying after shrinking in the second quarter due to a sales tax increase. But a Reuters Tankan poll indicated the economic recovery is likely to be modest, which could keep pressure on the central bank to act to sustain growth in the world's third largest economy. 
The Markit/JMMA flash Japan PMI jumped to a seasonally adjusted 52.4, up from 50.5 in July and the highest reading since March, just before a hike in taxes throttled demand. 
Separately, the Reuters Tantan poll showed confidence at Japanese manufacturers inched up in August to mark the first improvement since April, but the service sector's mood soured for the second straight month, reflecting a tame economic recovery from April's sales tax rise. 
Data on Wednesday showed Japan's exports rose in July for the first time in three months in a tentative sign that global demand is starting to recover, raising hopes that exports can offset sluggish consumer spending. 
Japan's economy shrank an annualized 6.8 percent in April-June, its biggest slump since the March 2011 earthquake, stoking fears that consumer spending had weakened more than expected due to the April tax hike. 
While a bounce was expected in the second half of the year as the impact of the tax increases fades and consumers start buying again, the plunge in GDP and uncertain export outlook have cast doubt on the strength of such a recovery. 
Flash PMIs from the eurozone later in the day are expected to show a similar cooling trend, with factory and service sector activity still expanding but at a slower rate. Germany's economy shrank in the second quarter and France again failed to conjure up any growth, snuffing out any signs of a recovery in the euro zone which is now also weighed down by tit-for-tat sanctions with Russia. 
A similar survey for U.S. manufacturing is expected to show continued strong expansion, which could add to speculation on when the U.S. central bank will begin raising interest rates. Most economists do not expect that to happen until mid-2015 given still sluggish wage growth and tame inflation.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 21, 2014 12:20AM ET</span>",China economy fears deepen as August HSBC flash PMI at three-month low,"By Xiaoyi Shao and Gui Qing Koh BEIJING (Reuters) - Growth in China's vast factory sector slowed to a three-month low in August as output and new orders moderated, a preliminary private survey showed on Thursday, heightening concerns about increasing softness in the economy.
The tepid reading came as China's economic growth appears to be faltering again, with recent indicators ranging from lending to output and investment all pointing to weakness.
With conditions looking increasingly unsteady, analysts say more stimulus may be needed in coming months to bolster growth and offset the downdraft from the cooling housing market.
The HSBC/Markit Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 50.3 from July's 18-month high of 51.7, missing a Reuters forecast of 51.5.
It was the lowest reading since May, though the PMI stayed above the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from contraction for a third consecutive month.
""Today's data suggest that the economic recovery is still continuing but its momentum has slowed again,"" said Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC.
""We think more policy support is needed to help consolidate the recovery. Both monetary and fiscal policy should remain accommodative until there is a more sustained rebound in economic activity,"" Qu said.
Losses for most Asian stock markets, including Hong Kong and China, deepened after the PMI survey while the Australian dollar fell. Australia is sensitive to news out of China, its key export market.
A HSBC/Markit sub-index measuring new orders, a gauge of demand at home and abroad, fell to a three-month low of 51.3. The sub-index for output also dropped to a three-month low in August.
MORE MEASURES EXPECTED
""Definitely there will be more measures to keep growth momentum steady in coming months,"" said Zhu Qibing, economist at Minzu Securities in Beijing. ""But we don't expect interest rate cuts in the near term as the central bank has reiterated that it would keep its prudent monetary policy unchanged.""
Wang Tao, China economist at UBS, said in a note to clients on Thursday that continued policy support, improved external demand plus new measures ""should keep growth momentum relatively firm through September"".
""The positive impact of still accommodative liquidity conditions, faster fiscal spending, and additional policy support, including intensified support for social housing and more widespread relaxation of local property restrictions, will still likely be felt in the next few months,"" Wang said.
Chen Dongqi, a researcher at a government think-tank affiliated to China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, said this month China should loosen monetary policy further through ""modest"" cuts in bank lending rates and reserve requirements.
China's cabinet pledged on Wednesday that it will lower taxes for high-tech companies and cutting red tape in its latest bid to help businesses operate.
PROPERTY WORRIES
The PMI survey also showed employment fell at a faster pace than in July, indicating more layoffs in the manufacturing sector which could begin to erode consumer confidence.
Any marked weakening in the labor market would raise alarm bells for China's leaders, who regard healthy employment levels as a top policy priority and an important condition for social stability.
A slowdown in the property market appears to be deepening, chilling activity in related sectors, while some economists fear banks may be increasingly reluctant to extend credit, particularly to private companies, as bad loans continue to rise and asset quality deteriorates.
The Bank of China Ltd (SS:601988) (HK:3988), the country's fourth-largest lender by market value, earlier this week reported slowing profit growth and said it could see more loans go bad in the second-half of the year as growth in the export sector founder.
Still, a Reuters poll in July showed analysts were divided over whether China would cut the reserve requirement (RRR) in coming months in a bid to free up more funds for banks to lend.
Half of the economists surveyed thought the RRR would be reduced by 50 basis points to 19.5 percent between October and March, and a vast majority thought interest rates would remain unchanged.
In a bid to re-invigorate the economy, China has relaxed monetary policy since April by easing controls in the property market, accelerating the construction of some infrastructure works, and relaxing reserve requirements for small banks to boost lending.
Some economists worry there is already more money in the system than it can digest and any new injections would flow directly into speculation, not the real economy, a view echoed by the central bank in recent statements.
In the past, a typical RRR cut by the PBOC was usually 50 basis points, and it would pump about 550 billion yuan (89.41 billion US dollar) base money into China's monetary base.

1109,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 20, 2014 10:30PM ET</span>",US Income On The Rise,"By Mark Hanrahan - Median household income in the United States has risen for the past three years, a sign that the recovery from the recession is finally beginning to take hold.
A new report by Steiner Research shows median income climbing 3.8 percent to $53,891 in June. The gains, however, are not enough to make up for the drop suffered during the recession, with the median still 4.8 percent below where it was in December 2007, when the recession began.
CNN Money says that Gordon Green, the author of the report, attributed the gap to high unemployment during the early years of the recession.
“Even though technically the recovery began in June 2009 ... the broad measures of unemployment were still high. As people found jobs, their incomes went up and then we started to see incomes turn around.”
The effect of this, said the New York Times, is that middle-class American families' income is lower now, when adjusted for inflation, than when the recovery began five years ago. 
Bloomberg reports that the report found white and black households fared better than Hispanic households over the past three years, and that regionally, incomes climbed most in the Midwest.

Despite this rise in income, and recent positive employment data, the negative effects of the recession are still being felt. A recent report  found income inequality is rising, in part because jobs gained during the recession paid 23 percent less than jobs lost during the recession.
In addition, the U.S. housing market is still not on a firm footing.

The Federal Reserve voted to leave benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and added it would cut its monthly bond-buying program to $25 billion from $35 billion.
The Fed said on July 30 that the overall economy is improving, though slackness remains in the labor market despite growth, which prompted monetary authorities to continue tapering its asset-purchasing program by only $10 billion per policy meeting.
The Fed's stimulus bond-buying program is seen concluding around October, and rate hikes are expected in 2015, though the timing of the latter remains up in the air.
While some monetary authorities favored studying more data before deciding, others felt action should come sooner rather than later.
""Many participants noted that if convergence toward the Committee's objectives occurred more quickly than expected, it might become appropriate to begin removing monetary policy accommodation sooner than they currently anticipated,"" the minutes read.
""Indeed, some participants viewed the actual and expected progress toward the Committee's goals as sufficient to call for a relatively prompt move toward reducing policy accommodation to avoid overshooting the Committee's unemployment and inflation objectives over the medium term,"" the minutes added.
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said that the U.S. economy is improving though monetary authorities continue to note slackness in the labor market, though the minutes revealed some monetary authorities feel that slackness may be absorbed in the near future.
""Many members noted, however, that the characterization of labor market underutilization might have to change before long, particularly if progress in the labor market continued to be faster than anticipated.""
The dollar firmed initially on the news.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.39% at 82.25.

1112,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 20, 2014 11:00AM ET</span>",US Apartment Construction Hits 25-Year High,"By Meagan Clark - Apartment construction in July hit a 25-year high, fueling the month’s pickup in housing while single-family home construction increased modestly. U.S. home construction, typically volatile month to month, increased 15.7 percent last month, the fastest pace since November after declines of 4 percent in June and 7.4 percent in May, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.
And while single-family building permits increased just 0.8 percent in July versus the year-earlier period, apartment permits increased 17.5 percent over the same period, according to Commerce Department data.
The surge in apartment construction fuels less economic growth nationally than a comparable rise in single-family homes because single-family housing multiplies consumer spending and job growth more, according to Diane Swonk, chief economist of Mesirow Financial.
“We tend to see more employment and spillover spending from owner than renters, but it is still a move in the right direction,” she blogged Tuesday.

Home owners tend to buy more furniture and home improvement products than apartment renters, for example. So the overall gain in construction, a sector the Federal Reserve keeps a close eye on as an indicator of the economy’s health, will impact spending, production and employment less than in the past.
The apartment surge is still a positive sign for job growth, but economists hope more renters will save enough for down payments or qualify for mortgages to buy homes. Rising rents may push renters onto the single-family housing market. According to the Labor Department, rents rose in July at their fastest pace in five years, a 3.3 percent rise from a year ago. "

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2014 08:37PM ET</span>",Japan export rebound offers hope for economic growth,"By Stanley White TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's exports rose in July for the first time in three months in a tentative sign that demand overseas is starting to recover, which could raise hopes that exports can offset a slump in consumer spending.
The export data will be a relief for the Bank of Japan, which has predicated its economic growth and inflation forecasts on a rapid rise in exports as part of the government's ""Abenomics"" plan to energize the Japanese economy.
The 3.9 percent annual rise in July was roughly in line with a 3.8 percent increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. It followed a revised 1.9 percent decline in the year to June.
Growth in exports was driven by increased shipments of automobiles and electric machinery, the data showed.
""The data shows exports are recovering moderately as a trend, so external demand may offset some of the weakness in domestic demand ahead,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But export growth is unlikely to accelerate much from here. Europe's economy lacks momentum and this will weigh on growth of Japan's big Asian export markets like China,"" he said.
Japan's exports have struggled for much of this year due to weak demand in Asia, so evidence of an export recovery suggests the economy may rebound from a sales tax hike in April, which would ease pressure on policymakers to take steps to support growth.
Exports to Asia, which account for more than half of Japan's total exports, rose 3.4 percent in July from a year ago as automobile shipments grew, finance ministry data showed on Wednesday, marking the first increase in three months. Exports to China, another important market for Japan, were up 2.6 percent in July, while shipments to the United States rose an annual 2.1 percent.
Japan's imports rose 2.3 percent in the year to July, compared with a median forecast for a 1.7 percent annual decline, as energy imports grew. That brought the trade balance to a deficit of 964 billion yen ($9.4 billion).
The economy shrank an annualized 6.8 percent in April-June, its biggest slump since the March 2011 earthquake, stoking fears that consumer spending had weakened more than expected after the April sales tax hike.
Exports also fell in the second quarter, showing that both domestic and external demand weakened.
Economists expect that Japan's gross domestic product will grow around 4 percent on an annualized basis in the current quarter, and many policymakers say stronger exports are needed to ensure that the economy remains on track.
The BOJ, however, has warned that the relocation of factories offshore, particularly for making cars, means that Japan may not be able to ramp up exports at will.

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2014 12:08PM ET</span>","U.S. housing market improving, inflation pressures muted","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts surged to an eight-month high in July, suggesting the nation's housing market recovery was back on track after stalling in the second half of last year. 
While the rebound points to sustained economic strength, other data on Tuesday showed inflation largely under wraps, which could give the Federal Reserve room to maintain its ultra-easy monetary policy stance for a bit longer. 
""The Fed will find these data further supportive of the go-it-slow approach to exiting its accommodative policies,"" said Dan Greenhaus, chief strategist at BTIG in New York. 
Groundbreaking for new housing jumped 15.7 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted 1.09-million unit annual pace, the highest level since November, the Commerce Department said. The gain snapped two straight months of declines and beat economists' expectations for a rise to only a 969,000-unit rate. 
It was the latest sign the market was regaining its footing after being slammed by a run-up in interest rates last year. A shortage of properties for sale has also lifted prices, pushing housing out of the reach of many first-time buyers. 
Separately, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index edged up 0.1 percent last month as declining energy costs partially offset increases in food and rents. The CPI had increased 0.3 percent in June. 
In the 12 months through July, the CPI increased 2.0 percent after advancing 2.1 percent in June. 
While the so-called core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, ticked up 0.1 percent for a second straight month, economists said there was no evidence the underlying trend in inflation was shifting lower. Rents, which account for more than a third of the CPI basket, increased 0.3 percent in July and were up 2.9 percent from a year ago. 
In the year through July, the core CPI was up 1.9 percent. 
The Fed targets 2 percent inflation, but it tracks an index that is running lower than the CPI. 
FED WATCHING WAGES 
Most economists do not expect the U.S. central bank to raise benchmark rates until around the middle of next year, given sluggish wage growth. It has kept rates near zero since December 2008. 
Average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation rose 0.3 percent year-on-year in July after a 0.2 percent dip in June, the Labor Department said. 
""Fed Chair (Janet) Yellen considers income growth as the key to future inflation issues and since she doesn't see any wage gains just yet, she will likely continue on course,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
""As for investors, limited inflation and stronger housing are nothing but good news since they imply good growth ahead without the Fed having to move prematurely."" 
U.S. stocks rose on the data, with homebuilders such as Pulte Group (N:PHM) and DR Horton (N:DHI) rallying. The PHLX housing sector index (HGX) was up 1.7 percent in late morning trading, outperforming the broader market. 
In another bright sign, home improvement retailer Home Depot (N:HD) reported second-quarter earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations and it raised its full-year profit forecast, sending its shares up 5.9 percent. 
Groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest part of the market, increased 8.3 percent in July to a seven-month high. Single-family starts in the South, where about half of the single-family construction takes place, rebounded 16.9 percent after dropping sharply in June. 
Starts for the volatile multi-family homes segment jumped 33 percent to the highest level since January 2006. This market is being buoyed by a shift towards renting, as many prospective buyers give up on the dream of owning a house. 
Building permits increased 8.1 percent, the largest gain since April 2013. Permits for single-family homes rose 0.9 percent to an eight-month high, while permits for multi-family housing soared 23.6 percent. 

""The recovery in both starts and permits is a welcome development that ... puts us back on a modest trend for residential investment activity,"" said Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York.

1128,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 19, 2014 09:30AM ET</span>",UK inflation falls more than expected; 2014 rate rise less likely,"By Andy Bruce and Sarah Young LONDON (Reuters) - British inflation fell more than expected in July and surging house price growth slowed in June, making it less likely the Bank of England will raise interest rates this year.
Inflation dropped to 1.6 percent in July from June's five-month high of 1.9 percent, according to official data that sent sterling tumbling to a four-month low against the dollar.
Last week, the BoE curbed expectations rates would rise in 2014 by slashing forecasts for wage growth. Any remaining pressure to raise record-low rates this year receded further after Tuesday's data.
""We view today's data as consistent with the mood music playing at present, which is that for now, a late-2014 increase in Bank Rate appears to be off the cards,"" said Victoria Clarke, economist at Investec.
Economists had expected consumer price inflation would tick down to 1.8 percent. The first annual fall in factory-gate prices since 2009 underlined the weakness in domestic inflation pressures.
Still, the outlook for inflation depends on estimates about the amount of slack left in Britain's economy, something that divides members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee.
Minutes for the MPC's August meeting are due on Wednesday and will be scrutinised for explicit signs of division, but most economists do not yet expect to see the first dissenting vote for a rate hike since July 2011.
Until last December, annual inflation had exceeded the Bank's 2 percent target every month since December 2009, eroding the spending power of households and making the fall in living standards a political issue before next year's election.
The fall in inflation this year has helped the Bank of England to hold off on raising interest rates, despite Britain's surprisingly strong economic recovery.
Wage growth has also been extremely weak, although BoE Governor Mark Carney said in a weekend newspaper interview that he would not necessarily wait for wages to rise faster than inflation before raising interest rates.
Compared with the previous month, the consumer price index in July was down 0.3 percent, the ONS said. The biggest downward pressure on inflation in July came from lower clothing and footwear prices, reflecting seasonal discounting which started slightly later this year than in 2013.
HOUSING MARKET COOLING?
Rapid house-price inflation - described as the biggest domestic threat to Britain's financial stability by BoE Governor Mark Carney - also eased slightly in June, according to separate data from the Office for National Statistics.
Annual house prices grew 10.2 percent in June, down from 10.4 percent in May. Nonetheless, for the second quarter as a whole, the annual increase of 10.2 percent was the biggest since the third quarter of 2007.
Growth in property prices continued to be led by London, where they rose 19.3 percent higher than a year earlier, down slightly from May's 20.1 percent annual rise.
""With recent data from Rightmove and RICS pointing to a subsequent slowdown through the summer, we expect to see house- price inflation slow back to single-digit rates over the second half of the year,"" said Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to accountants Ernst & Young.
Asking prices for houses in Britain have fallen at the sharpest pace on record for the month of August, led by a drop in London, according to property website Rightmove on Monday.
Data also released by the ONS on Tuesday showed that factory-gate prices fell by 0.1 percent in annual terms, the first drop since October 2009 and slightly below economists' predictions for no change.

""The weakness in producer prices highlights the near-term disinflationary effects from the rising pound,"" said Michael Saunders, chief UK economist at Citi.

The following is the full text release from the central bank.
Members Present
Glenn Stevens (Governor and Chair), Philip Lowe (Deputy Governor), John Akehurst, Roger Corbett AO, John Edwards, Kathryn Fagg, Martin Parkinson PSM (Secretary to the Treasury), Heather Ridout AO, Catherine TannaOthers Present
Guy Debelle (Assistant Governor, Financial Markets), Christopher Kent (Assistant Governor, Economic), Jonathan Kearns (Head, Economic Analysis Department), Alexandra Heath (Head, Economic Research Department), Anthony Dickman (Secretary), Peter Stebbing (Deputy Secretary)
International Economic Conditions
Members began their discussion by noting that growth in Australia's major trading partners was expected to be a bit above its long-run average pace in both 2014 and 2015, even though growth appeared to have eased in the June quarter. That slowing largely reflected a contraction in Japan's output after the consumption tax increase in April, partly offset by stronger growth in China and the United States.
In China, GDP growth in the June quarter was consistent with the authorities' target for growth of 7.5 per cent in 2014 as a whole. The recent improvement in growth was driven by a rebound in exports and a pick-up in investment growth, which partly reflected the effect of modest stimulus measures. Conditions in Chinese residential property markets had weakened further, particularly in the larger cities, as many local government restrictions on property transactions implemented prior to 2014 remained in place.
In Japan, temporary fiscal stimulus measures had been introduced to counter the contractionary effects of the consumption tax increase, but the underlying pace of growth remained uncertain. Members observed that labour market conditions had tightened considerably over the past year, although wages growth had remained modest. Growth in the rest of east Asia appeared to have slowed over the first half of 2014 from the strong pace recorded in late 2013. Monetary policies in the region generally remained expansionary, but had been tightened a little in some countries, partly in response to a modest pick-up in core inflation.
The US economy grew strongly in the June quarter after adverse weather had contributed to weakness earlier in the year. Investment was stronger in the June quarter and consumption growth had picked up to around the pace seen through 2013. The labour market continued to strengthen and inflation had picked up a little over recent months, while the pace of recovery in the housing market had slowed.
Members noted that the gradual recovery of economic activity in the euro area appeared to be continuing, although unemployment remained high and inflation was well below the target set by the European Central Bank (ECB).
Prices for bulk commodities had declined over recent months, much of which owed to an increase in the supply of these commodities from lower-cost mines.Domestic Economic Conditions
Members noted that the inflation outcome for the June quarter had been a little higher than expected. Underlying inflation was around ¾ per cent in the quarter and 2¾ per cent over the year, while year-ended CPI inflation was a little higher, at 3 per cent. Much of the increase in CPI inflation over the past year reflected a pick-up in tradables inflation, which was consistent with pass-through of the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate. This was comparable to that in previous episodes. Prices of consumer durables had declined less rapidly over the past year than in recent years, which was consistent with the effects of the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate.
Non-tradables inflation had remained subdued at just over 3 per cent, its slowest pace in over a decade. The decline in non-tradables inflation since 2013 was most evident in lower growth of prices for market services. This was consistent with the slowing in growth of labour costs, which reflected both lower wages growth and higher productivity growth. Meanwhile, inflation in the cost of new dwellings had increased over the past 18 months or so, reflecting increased demand for residential construction. The prices of ‘administered’ items – those with regulated prices or for which the public sector is a significant provider – had also continued to increase at well above the pace of the overall CPI. Members discussed some of the forces underpinning the relatively strong growth in these prices.
A number of labour market indicators had improved a little since the beginning of 2014. Employment growth had broadly matched population growth and the unemployment and participation rates both remained steady in trend terms. Forward-looking indicators of labour demand had generally improved, but pointed to only modest employment growth in the near term. A notable degree of spare capacity in the labour market was suggested by the relatively high unemployment rate and the participation rate being close to its lowest rate in almost a decade.
Turning to household consumption, members noted that the volume of retail sales declined in the June quarter, in part reflecting the unusually warm weather at the start of winter. There had been a marked decline in consumer sentiment since earlier in the year, although a more timely weekly measure of sentiment had rebounded to be at above-average levels in recent weeks.
Members observed that residential dwelling approvals had declined somewhat in recent months, but remained at a high level and, in combination with the substantial amount of residential work yet to be done, suggested that dwelling investment was likely to remain strong in the period ahead. Conditions in the established housing market also remained strong and while house price inflation across the country in 2014 had not been as rapid as over the second half of 2013, it had remained robust. Auction clearance rates in Sydney had eased from their high levels in late 2013, although they had increased in Melbourne more recently. Factors influencing the demand for and supply of housing at present were also noted.
Measures of business conditions had remained at around average levels. Survey measures of investment intentions had also been around average, after picking up from the lower levels seen in 2013. Members noted that information from liaison continued to indicate that firms were reluctant to undertake significant investment projects until they experienced a sustained period of strong demand. While non-residential building approvals had declined in trend terms since early 2014, the stock of work yet to be done was expected to support the current level of non-residential construction in coming quarters.
The volume of exports was estimated to have declined in the June quarter, after increasing strongly in the preceding quarter as a result of strong growth in resource exports. The growth of iron ore and coal exports had been expected to moderate from the rapid pace seen in recent years, as capacity was forecast to expand at a slower rate over coming quarters. While construction of large projects to expand LNG capacity was proceeding, production was not expected to begin increasing noticeably until 2015.
Members noted that staff forecasts for domestic GDP growth were not materially different from those presented three months earlier. Growth was expected to be below average over 2014/15 before increasing to an above-average pace by 2016. Growth in non-mining activity had been expected to increase a little further, having already picked up over the past year, partly as a result of the support provided by the very low level of interest rates. Resource exports were forecast to add substantially to growth over the next few years. However, mining investment was expected to decline more rapidly than it had to date, and ongoing fiscal consolidation and the effects of the still high level of the exchange rate were expected to restrain growth. Members considered the implications for the forecasts of the usual assumptions that the cash rate and the exchange rate remained at their current levels and noted that the no-change assumption for the cash rate was consistent with market expectations over the near term. Members also noted the significant uncertainties around the growth forecast and the importance of considering the risks to the forecast as well as the central projection.
Overall, underlying inflation was expected to be consistent with the target over the forecast period. Domestic inflationary pressures were likely to remain subdued, reflecting spare capacity in labour and product markets. Working in the other direction, the decline in the exchange rate since early 2013 had pushed up import prices and these higher prices ‘across the docks’ were being passed through to prices facing consumers. The recent abolition of the carbon price would push inflation lower in 2014/15 than earlier assumed.
Financial Markets
Members observed that conditions in financial markets continued to be characterised by low volatility, notwithstanding the heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as the ongoing uncertainty about the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate in the United States. Volatility in foreign exchange markets remained particularly low, and it was only in mid July that the S&P 500 index for the United States ended the longest period of daily movements of less than 1 per cent in nearly two decades.
As expected, the Federal Reserve reduced its asset purchases to US$25 billion a month at its July meeting and reiterated its intention to reduce them by a further US$10 billion at its September meeting. Members noted that the Fed's plan is to end these purchases altogether in October, as long as the economy progresses as expected, and that markets expect the first rise in the federal funds rate will take place in mid 2015. Over the past month, the ECB released further details on its targeted long-term refinancing operations announced in June. In addition, it announced that from 2015 the frequency of monetary policy meetings will change from a monthly to a six-week cycle and the ECB will start publishing the minutes of its monetary policy meetings.
Members noted that yields on long-term US government bonds were unchanged over July, while Australian bond yields had declined in response to domestic developments, with the 10-year spread between the two bonds reaching its lowest level since 2006. Yields on 10-year German Bunds moved lower over the past month – reaching an all-time low of 1.12 per cent – while spreads between yields on Portuguese government bonds and Bunds had widened because of the difficulties experienced by Banco Espírito Santo, Portugal's largest bank by total assets.
Developments in many emerging market sovereign bond markets had been uneventful over the past month. However, yields had moved significantly higher in Russia, as sanctions were imposed, as well as in Argentina, which had defaulted on its restructured debt after a New York court ruled that it could not make payments unless it also paid ‘holdout’ creditors that had refused to accept the restructuring of bonds after the 2001 default.
Equity prices in the major markets had generally been little changed over the past month, with ongoing low volatility, although share price indices in the US markets had reached another high in late July before falling back subsequently. The Australian market had also reached its highest level since 2008 in July, driven in particular by rises in share prices of the large resource companies.
Members noted that large legal settlements with banks in the United States and some significant fines in the United Kingdom had brought the total value of fines imposed on major US and European banks thus far in 2014 to more than US$35 billion.
Conditions in foreign exchange markets continued to be quiet over the past month, with little change in major exchange rates in July and volatility remaining around historic lows. The US dollar recorded a modest appreciation while the euro depreciated by 2 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. The Australian dollar also depreciated slightly against the US dollar and on a trade-weighted basis over the past month, although it remained well above its level in late January notwithstanding lower commodity prices and a narrowing in interest rate differentials between Australia and most other advanced economies since then.
Members noted that Australian banks had issued new bonds at around the same level as maturities, resulting in little net issuance in recent months. Secondary market spreads of the major banks' senior unsecured bonds to Commonwealth Government Securities had remained at their lowest levels since 2007, which was gradually reducing the banks' average cost of financing as more expensive bonds matured. The low cost of wholesale financing, combined with an easing in competition in the deposit market, had contributed to a decline in banks' deposit rates in recent months.
Average lending rates on housing and business loans in Australia continued to edge down over July, mainly owing to the ongoing replacement of more expensive fixed-rate and discount variable-rate loans from previous years. Overall, cumulative movements in interest rates since the start of the year amounted to a noticeable easing in financial conditions. Financial markets continued to expect the Bank to leave the cash rate target unchanged at the August meeting and over the year ahead.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
Growth in Australia's major trading partners was expected to be a little above average in both 2014 and 2015. Commodity prices remained high, although iron ore and coal prices had declined following a substantial increase in the supply of these commodities. Global financial conditions were accommodative, with long-term interest rates and risk spreads remaining at low levels and volatility in financial prices declining further.
Domestically, GDP growth had been above average in the March quarter because of strong growth in resource exports and a pick-up in non-mining activity. On current indications, resource exports appeared to have been little changed in the June quarter and mining investment continued to fall. Public spending was scheduled to be subdued and the pace of consumption was likely to have remained around the moderate pace recorded in the March quarter. Meanwhile, the recovery in dwelling investment had gathered pace and conditions in the established housing market remained strong. Indicators of investment intentions in the non-mining sector were showing signs of improvement since the latter part of 2013, although liaison suggested that businesses were reluctant to commit to major new investment projects until they perceived a sustained pick-up in demand. Overall, GDP growth was likely to have slowed to a more moderate pace in the June quarter and was expected to be below trend over 2014/15, before picking up thereafter.
While there had been some modest improvement in indicators of labour demand over the course of the year to date, it was likely to be some time before unemployment declined consistently. This suggested that wage growth was likely to remain subdued, which should keep inflation consistent with the target in the medium term. Factors that had led inflation to be higher than expected over the past year, including the extent of pass-through to prices of the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate, were expected to ease over the forecast period.
Members noted that the current setting of monetary policy in Australia remained accommodative and supportive of demand. Credit growth had picked up a little and dwelling prices had continued to increase, albeit at a slower pace than was the case a year earlier. Interest rates were very low and had declined a little further since the last reduction in the cash rate. On the other hand, the exchange rate remained high by historical standards, particularly given the notable decline in the prices of some key commodities, and hence was offering less assistance than it might in achieving balanced growth in the economy.
Staff forecasts suggested that inflation, despite recent higher readings, was likely to be consistent with the 2–3 per cent target over the next two years. Output growth would probably be somewhat softer in the near term after recent higher readings, but was expected gradually to strengthen again over the forecast period. Members noted that there was inevitably a significant degree of uncertainty about the outlook, given the number of forces working in different directions. The Board judged that monetary policy was appropriately configured and that, on present indications, the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 18, 2014 10:43AM ET</span>",Homebuilders rally after strong NAHB sentiment data,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding stocks rose on Monday, boosted by data that showed homebuilder sentiment rose in August to its highest level since January. 
Sentiment rose as labor market conditions improved, according to the National Association of Home Builders data. The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index rose to 55 in August from 53 in July, the group said in a statement. It was the third straight monthly gain, and topped the mean estimate of analysts polled by Reuters for a reading of 53. 
Following the data, the PHLX Housing index (HGX) rose 1.5 percent, more than twice the advance of the S&P 500's (SPX) 0.7 percent rise. PulteGroup Inc (N:PHM) was one of the S&P's biggest percentage gainers, up 2.3 percent to $18.69. 
Among other names, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI) rose 1.8 percent to $21.21, Toll Brothers (N:TOL) gained 2.1 percent to $34.69 and Beazer Homes (N:BZH) added 2.7 percent to $17.77. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders exchange-traded fund (P:XHB) rose 1.7 percent to $21.12. 
The U.S. dollar index <.DXY> rose 0.2 percent, with gains accelerating after the data was released. 
Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable. 
""Each of the three components of the HMI registered consecutive gains for the past three months, which is a positive sign that builder confidence appears to be firming following an uneven spring,"" said NAHB Chief Economist David Crowe. ""Factors contributing to this rise include sustained job growth, historically low mortgage rates and affordable home prices, which are helping to unleash pent-up demand."" 
The single-family home sales component rose to 58 from a revised 56 and was also the highest reading since January. The gauge of single-family sales expectations for the next six months rose to 65, the highest since August 2013, while prospective buyer traffic rose from 39 to 42, the highest since December.

1146,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 15, 2014 03:15PM ET</span>",Brazil’s World Cup Hangover: A Shrinking Economy,"By Meagan Clark - Economic activity in Brazil fell sharply in June, the latest sign indicating Latin America’s largest economy could be slipping into a light recession with a presidential election two months away.
The Brazilian central bank’s index of economic activity fell 1.5 percent in June from May after seasonal adjustments, the bank said Friday, the fifth consecutive monthly decline and the worst since summer 2013.
Brazil's tourism ministry estimated the World Cup attracted a million foreign tourists for the soccer tournament to Brasilia in June, injected $13.2 billion into the country's economy (about the same the country invested for preparation) and created 1 million jobs. But Brazil's labor ministry reported the worst job creation in June since 1998. Labor Minister Manoel Dias has partially blamed the World Cup, saying it caused ""a drastic drop in consumption"" that led to less working days and less hiring, the Wall Street Journal reported from Brasilia.
While Brazilian employers usually allow workers time off to watch the national team play, Brazil's 12 host cities declared partial holidays during local matches of any team, Dias said.
The central bank's index measures the industrial, services and farming sectors and differs from the gross domestic product data estimated by government statistics agency IBGE, which economists consider the official measure of economic growth.
“The data were ugly,” Neil Shearing, chief emerging markets economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note Friday. “It supports the message from both the business surveys and the hard data on industrial production and retail sales, which also suggest that Brazil’s economy has weakened considerably in recent months.”
The central bank’s reading is consistent with a 0.6 percent decline in GDP in the second quarter from the previous quarter, according to research released Friday by Bank of America Corp. NYSE:BAC. Shearing forecasts a 0.5 percent quarterly decline in Brazilian GDP and about 0.8 percent GDP growth this year. Brazil’s economy grew at 0.2 percent in the first quarter from the previous quarter, according to IBGE.
Consumer spending is slowing down too. In June, retail sales across Brazil fell 0.7 percent, much worse than consensus expectations for a 0.4 percent increase from the previous month. All sectors declined, except for supermarkets, Brazilian government data shows. Auto sales declined nearly 13 percent in June, pulled down by Argentina's ailing economy, the sector's main export market, and tightening credit in Brazil.
Industrial output shrank by 2 percent over the quarter compared to the previous quarter, the fourth successive quarterly decline, according to government data. 

Brazil’s National Confederation of Industry, a trade group, said in a July report that its leading indicator for industrial health fell to its lowest point since 2010. 
“There are certainly some atypical factors in June and the World Cup affected the results in an exceptional way,” the CNI report said. “Still, the survey results from recent months indicate that the negative environment isn’t new and that June’s deterioration should have lasting consequences.”
The sharp fall in the economy could prompt Brazil’s central bank to surprise the region with a pre-election cut of interest rates from the current 11 percent at a September meeting. Inflation data coming Aug. 20 will be crucial in the decision, Shearing wrote.

1148,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 15, 2014 12:28PM ET</span>",Robust manufacturing output buoys U.S. economic outlook,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output rose broadly in July and automobile production recorded its largest increase in five years, boosting the economy at the start of the third quarter.
While other data on Friday showed some cooling in factory activity in New York state this month, economists said it did not change the view of an economy with strong momentum, noting that the pullback followed a robust increase in July.
""The broad-based nature of the (manufacturing) gains indicates that the strong second-quarter rebound in economic growth momentum is being sustained,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
The Federal Reserve said factory production jumped 1.0 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in June. That was the largest gain since February and reflected increases across all major categories.
Auto production surged 10.1 percent, the biggest rise since July 2009. There were also sturdy gains in the production of machinery and computers and electronic goods, which economists said hinted at a pick-up in business investment this quarter.
A stronger pace of business investment is needed to ensure sustained economic growth.
The economy grew at a 4.0 percent annual pace in the second quarter and current forecasts peg the growth rate for the third quarter within a range of 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent.
Industrial capacity utilization, a measure of how fully firms are using their resources, last month hit its highest level since February 2008.
The solid rise in manufacturing and a 0.3 percent advance in mining output helped to offset a 3.4 percent weather-driven decline in utilities production. That left overall industrial production up 0.4 percent in July.
The data had little impact on U.S. financial markets, with traders focusing instead on events in Ukraine. The Ukrainian government said its forces had attacked and partly destroyed a Russian armored column that entered Ukrainian territory overnight.
BENIGN PRODUCER INFLATION
In a separate report, the New York Fed said its ""Empire State"" general business conditions index fell to 14.69 this month from 25.60 in July.
A reading above zero indicates expansion. Growth in new orders slowed, but a further decline in inventories pointed to an acceleration in activity in the months ahead.
While manufacturing is gaining steam, there is little sign of a broad pick-up in inflation pressures at the factory gate.
In another report, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand edged up 0.1 percent in July as the cost of energy products fell, offsetting an increase in food prices.
Prices received by the nation's farms, factories and refineries rose 0.4 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, producer prices increased 1.7 percent.
Excluding food and energy, wholesale prices gained 0.2 percent, matching June's increase. They were up 1.6 percent in the 12 months through July.
""Aside from recent energy weakness, the PPI results continued to point to a steady firming in underlying inflation trends that we expect to continue to be seen in a continued inflection higher in the core consumer price index as well,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. 
Overall, inflation has been rising in recent months, a fact acknowledged by the Fed at its July policy meeting. The U.S. central bank, which had repeatedly warned that price pressures were too low, said the likelihood of inflation running persistently below its 2 percent target had diminished somewhat.
Firming inflation and a tightening labor market have led some economists to anticipate an early interest rate increase from the Fed. The central bank, however, has shown no sign of being in a hurry to lift its benchmark lending rate from near zero, where it has been since December 2008.

Another report on Friday showed consumer sentiment hit a nine-month low in early August. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 79.2 from 81.8 in July.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary August reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 79.2, down from a final reading of 81.8 the month before.
It was below the the median forecast of 82.5 among economists polled by Reuters, and was the lowest since a reading of 75.1 in November of last year.
""While the data implies differential prospects for retailers, consumer confidence remains at moderately positive levels, high enough to support a continued expansion in personal consumption during the year ahead,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 99.6 from 97.4 and above a forecast of 97.8.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations slipped for a fourth straight month, to 66.2 from 71.8. The subindex was below an expected 73.0 and was the lowest since last October.
The survey's one-year inflation expectation rose to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent, while the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook rose to 2.8 percent from 2.7 percent.
""Importantly, upper income households reported quite substantial financial progress, but they reported the same sized losses as lower income households in their outlook for the overall economy,"" Curtin said.

Analysts see the economy growing at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in the current quarter, up from a previous estimate of 2.9 percent, according to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's quarterly survey of 43 forecasters, released on Friday.
Fourth-quarter growth was forecast at 3.1 percent, down from a previous estimate of 3.2 percent, and first-quarter 2015 growth was estimated at 3.1 percent, unchanged from an earlier estimate of 3.1 percent.
Meanwhile, they see the economy growing at a rate of 2.1 percent for all of 2014, down from the previous estimate of 2.4 percent in the previous survey in May.
Growth in 2015 is expected to come in at 3.1 percent, unchanged from the 3.1 percent estimate in the May survey.
The pace of hiring was expected to accelerate in the current quarter compared with previous expectations, with an average rate of monthly nonfarm job growth seen around 228,600 versus a previous forecast of 204,700. That is expected to dip in the fourth quarter, averaging 211,200, although that is up from a prior forecast of 197,900.
Hiring should average 204,800 a month for all of 2014, compared with the prior full-year forecast of 196,500.
The jobless rate was expected to be 6.1 percent at the end of the current quarter and 6.0 percent by the end of the fourth quarter.
The most recent official unemployment rate released by the government showed the jobless rate in July stood at 6.2 percent, up a tenth of a point from June's reading, which was the lowest since September 2008.
Inflation was expected to remain muted, with year-on-year core consumer price inflation, which strips out food and energy costs, averaging 2.1 percent in the third quarter, compared with a previous estimates of 1.8 percent. Fourth-quarter core CPI was seen at 2.1 percent versus a previous forecast of 1.9 percent.
Looking at the inflation measure most closely tracked by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the core personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index, forecasters also see muted price pressures. The third-quarter rate was seen at 1.8 percent, up from 1.7 percent in the May survey.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2014 05:50PM ET</span>",U.S. retailers feel the pinch as frugal shoppers curb spending,"By Siddharth Cavale and Sruthi Ramakrishnan (Reuters) - Weak results from the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (N:WMT) and Macy's Inc (N:M) are the latest sign less affluent U.S. consumers are still pinching their pennies and the trend appears to be hurting upmarket retailers as well.
A number of large U.S. retailers who cater to low and middle income consumers reported disappointing quarterly comparable sales this week, pointing to a cutback in spending and a shift in preferences to stores nearer to home.
""Consumers are still concerned about cost of living and employment...overall we are seeing no changes in the consumer than what we have seen in the last few quarters,"" Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on Thursday.
Wal-Mart cut its profit forecast for the year, citing higher healthcare and online investment costs, but also cautioned that heavy discounting would continue into the holiday season to draw in its shoppers, many of whom depend on government assistance.
Even department store operator Macy's, which caters to a more affluent clientele, lowered its same-store sales forecast for the year.
The weak sales and margin data illustrate the effects of a slowly improving job market, volatile fuel prices and government food stamp cuts, Joseph Agnese, equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ told Reuters.
""Even though the job market has picked up, income growth is very weak. We are adding jobs but average earnings aren't growing very rapidly,"" Robert Brusca, chief economist at consulting firm Fact and Opinion Economics, said in a phone interview.
Amid the general gloom, one surprising glimmer of hope came from struggling department store chain J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP), which reported a 5 percent rise in quarterly sales and a narrower loss.
SPENDING RESTRAINT
Even McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), which sells burgers and fries for as little as a dollar, has struggled to grow sales at established restaurants in the United States since November 2013. Same-restaurant sales at home fell 3.2 percent in July.
The Labor Department's monthly employment report showed more than 200,000 jobs created for the sixth straight month in July.
But, Brusca said, a lot of the jobs are being added in low-income brackets.
Spending would be much greater if wages increased for the people already employed, he said.
American workers, on average, earned $24.45 an hour in July, up only a penny from June, the Labor Department's data showed.
Over the last year, wages have grown just 2 percent, in keeping with where they have been stuck since late 2009. Before then, hourly earnings typically rose 3 percent or 4 percent a year.
""Consumer sentiment is the highest since 2007, but consumer optimism isn't translating into spending,"" Guy LeBas, analyst at Janney Capital Markets told Reuters.
The restraint is hurting retailers in the ""affordable luxury"" space such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (N:KORS) and Kate Spade & Co's (N:KATE), which have had to fall back on discounts to push their handbags and other accessories.
Kate Spade shares lost nearly a quarter of their value on Tuesday after the retailer said gross margins were being hit by intense competition, particularly in its low-end Kate Spade Saturday brand.
Michael Kors's quarterly margins were squeezed by increased discounting to clear inventory and watchmaker Fossil Inc (O:FOSL) announced lower profits as declining mall traffic, a problem for many retailers, took its toll.
The rise of e-commerce has played a role in the weakness of brick and mortar retailers as well, although Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is struggling to reap a bottom-line boost from its surging sales.
Price cuts have now become a necessity for many retailers as well, to be able ""to compete with the aggressive department store promotions"" and get customers ""to purchase in an otherwise stagnant fashion environment,"" Wedbush analysts wrote in a note.
In addition to McDonald's, the U.S. consumer's reluctance to spend has also hit some of the country's more upscale ""fast-casual"" eateries, where many chains have been feeling the squeeze even as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (N:CMG) has prospered.
Noodles & Co (O:NDLS), a full-service restaurant chain, on Wednesday slashed full-year sales forecasts, in part for a drop in frugal customers visiting its restaurants.
Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc's (O:RRGB), also a fast-casual chain, fell 18 percent on Thursday, reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales and profit citing intense and ""non-sustainable discounting"" from rivals.

1171,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 14, 2014 01:15PM ET</span>",Subprime Auto Loans Raise Red Flag,"By Meagan Clark - Americans racked up less overall debt from April to June, after three consecutive quarters of debt increase. However, they continued to borrow more in credit card debt, student loans and particularly car loans, the Federal Reserve said Thursday.
Auto loans have increased for 13 straight quarters, with new loans reaching the highest volume since 2006, especially for those with low credit scores, who may not be able to pay banks back. According to the Fed, the dollar value of loans borrowed by people with credit scores below 660 (called subprime loans) has about doubled since 2009, while loans for other credit-score groups have increased by only half.
The latest data confirms a trend similar to the subprime mortgage market in 2008 that triggered the financial crisis. Subprime loans carry high interest rates that benefit investors but are often unknown or misunderstood by borrowers who may have glossed over the fine print. Auto finance companies and banks and credit unions have been lending to car consumers roughly equally, the Fed said. The Justice Department started probing lenders' underwriting criteria of subprime auto loans earlier this summer.
Outstanding student loan balances reported on credit cards over the quarter increased to $1.12 trillion as of June 30, a $124 billion increase from a year ago, the report found. About 11 percent of student loan debt is 90 days behind payment or in default, compared to 3 percent of auto loans. Balances on credit cards increased another $10 billion in the quarter, up 1 percent from the first quarter and reflecting a gradual but steady increase over recent years.

Housing debt, on the other hand, has fallen to $286 billion, the lowest level since 2000, the Fed said. Foreclosures have steadily declined since 2009.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 14, 2014 09:09AM ET</span>","U.S. jobless claims up, but trend favors strong labor market","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, but will probably do little to change views that the labor market was strengthening. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 311,000 for the week ended Aug. 9, the Labor Department said on Thursday, above economists' expectations for a rise to only 295,000. 
There is, however, little doubt that conditions in the jobs market are firming. Although the four-week average of claims, a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose modestly last week, it remained at levels consistent with solid job gains. 
The dollar edged down against a basket of currencies after the data. 
A significant decline in layoffs, which has pushed claims down to their pre-recession levels, has been the major driver of an improving job market. 
But hiring is also gaining traction. A report on Tuesday showed hiring rose in June to its highest level since February 2008. The number of job openings that month was the highest since February 2001. 
The strengthening labor market picture has some economists betting on an early interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve. 
The U.S. central bank has kept its benchmark interest rate near zero since December 2008 and has shown little sign of being in a hurry to start tightening monetary policy. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen argues that there is still slack in the labor market, citing tepid wage growth and a large number of long-term unemployed Americans and those working part-time. 
The jobless claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 25,000 to 2.54 million in the week ended Aug. 2. 
The unemployment rate for people receiving jobless benefits was 1.9 percent for the fifth successive week. 
In a second report, the Labor Department said import prices decreased 0.2 percent last month as a decline in the cost of petroleum offset a rebound in food prices. 
Import prices had gained 0.1 percent in June. In the 12 months through July, import prices increased 0.8 percent. 
Sluggish global demand is keeping imported inflation subdued. Imported petroleum prices fell 1.2 percent in July, the largest decline since November, after rising 1.1 percent the prior month. Imported food prices increased 1.0 percent. That followed a 1.6 percent decline in June. 

Imported inflation was also dampened by weak automobiles prices, which recorded their largest drop since December 1992.

BERLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic growth ground to a halt in the second quarter as Germany's economy shrank and France's stagnated. 
The zero growth reported by statistics agency Eurostat on Thursday was cause for alarm throughout the 18-nation region, which is already bracing for the impact of sanctions imposed on and by Russia over Ukraine. 
Germany, Europe's largest economy, contracted by 0.2 percent in the quarter, undercutting Bundesbank forecasts that gross domestic product would be unchanged. Foreign trade and investment were notable weak spots, the German Statistics Office said on Thursday. 
""Today's figures show that the upturn remains too weak to withstand external shocks"" - such as the Russian sanctions - ""meaning that GDP growth will probably remain stuck in stop-and-go mode,"" said Peter Vanden Houte, chief euro zone economist at ING. 
France fared little better; its GDP failed to grow for the second quarter in a row. That forced the French government to confront reality, saying it would miss its budget deficit target this year and cutting its 2014 forecast for 1 percent growth in half. 
Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, slid back into recession for the third time since 2008 in the second quarter, shrinking by 0.2 percent. Pressure grew on Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to complete promised structural reforms. 
""Bottom line is that the ECB will have to maintain an extremely accommodative monetary policy, even if the U.S. will see a first rate hike already in 2015. The bank will likely be pressured to undertake additional action if some of the downside risks materialize,"" ING's Vanden Houte said. 
The European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged at record lows in July. But the bank signaled that it stood ready to take more action - perhaps printing money and buying bonds - if the region slides towards deflation. 

""Looking ahead, recent leading indicators are not delivering a very promising message. Risks from Russia - directly and via second-round effects from CEE region - cannot be underestimated. Less dynamic growth for 3Q14 and 2014 is likely,"" said Martina von Terzi, an analysts with UniCredit.

1197,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 13, 2014 12:55PM ET</span>","U.S. retail sales pause, seen rebounding in months ahead","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales unexpectedly stalled in July, pointing to some loss of momentum in the economy early in the third quarter. 
But with job growth holding sturdy, sales activity was likely to rebound in the coming months, economists said. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales, which had increased 0.2 percent in June, were in part held back by a second straight month of declines in receipts at auto dealers. July's reading was the weakest since January. 
""Given the strong gains in labor market activity, along with other indications of strengthening domestic growth momentum, we expect this slowdown to be short-lived and we look for consumer spending to rebound strongly in the coming months,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. 
Economists had forecast sales, which account for a third of consumer spending, increasing 0.2 percent last month. 
The economy has experienced six consecutive months of job growth above 200,000. Layoffs and job openings are back to their pre-recession levels. Data on manufacturing and services sectors have suggested the economy was growing solidly. 
Still, the pause in retail sales could give the Federal Reserve ammunition to maintain its very easy monetary policy stance for a while. The U.S. central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate near zero since December 2008. 
""It will provide Fed Chair Janet Yellen with some of the rationale she needs to justify why the Fed should move gradually and keep interest rates low for longer than hawks within the Fed would like,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. 
Separately, retailer Macy's Inc. (N:M) cut its full-year same-stores sales forecast after second-quarter sales fell short of expectations, another cloud over the retail sector. 
Macy's shares fell more than five percent, while shares of retailers Tiffany (N:TIF), Kohl's (N:KSS) and Nordstrom (N:JWN) also were down sharply. 
The S&P retail index was up at midday, but lagged the broader stock index, which was trading higher as tensions in Ukraine and Iraq eased. The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. 
CORE SALES BARELY RISE 
So-called core retail sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services edged up 0.1 percent in July. These sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. 
May and June core retail sales, however, were revised lower. 
That and another Commerce Department report showing non-auto retail inventories rose only modestly in June suggested the government could cut its estimate for second-quarter growth from the brisk 4 percent annual pace report last month. 
JPMorgan estimated that second-quarter growth would be cut by 0.4 percentage point. 
""People are just not parting with their hard-earned funds and that is a concern,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. 
In July, receipts at auto dealerships fell 0.2 percent after dropping 0.3 percent the prior month. Sales at non-store retailers, which include online sales, fell. 

There were also declines in sales at furniture, electronics and appliances, and general merchandise stores. Receipts at clothing retailers rose as did sales at sporting goods shops and building materials and garden equipment suppliers.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial production contracted unexpectedly for a second month in a row in June, further denting hopes of a stronger recovery as the bloc starts to take the hit from conflict in Iraq, Ukraine and Gaza, data showed on Wednesday. 
Output at factory gates single currency bloc fell 0.3 percent on the month in June after a 1.1 percent drop in May, against market expectations of a 0.3 percent rise. 
When compared with the same period of last year, production was flat, following an upwardly revised 0.6 percent rise in May, while economists polled by Reuters expected a 0.1 percent annual increase in June. 
It was the lowest annual reading since August 2013. 
The monthly drop was due mainly to a 1.9 percent drop in production of non-durable consumer goods, down for a second consecutive month and 0.7 percent fall in energy production, which was up in the previous three months. 
Economic recovery in the 9.6 trillion euro economy is struggling to gain momentum a year after exiting a recession, throttled by combination of high unemployment, sluggish reform the fallout from conflict in Ukraine, Gaza and Iraq. 
The latest sign of just how fragile the euro zone's economic rebound remains came from Germany on Tuesday where investor sentiment nosedived to its lowest since December 2012 on what impact European sanctions against Russia will have. 
Eurostat will publish the second quarter economic growth flash estimate on Thursday. Economists surveyed by Reuters expected an expansion of 0.2 percent on the quarter in the three months to June, the same pace as seen in the first quarter. 
While the bloc's three largest economies saw production rising on the month in June, Germany's industrial output fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in June in the country's first annual drop since July 2013. 
The bloc's No. 2 economy, France, saw flat output on the year in June, its best performance since December, and Italy's industrial production rose by 0.4 percent in June after a 1.7 percent decline in May. 
Much stronger expansion, a scenario not seen as likely any time soon, is needed to spur job creation and rejuvenate countries choked by austerity and the legacy of recession.

1209,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 13, 2014 02:30AM ET</span>",Sales Tax Hike Squeezes Japan's Growth,"By Avaneesh Pandey -
Japan’s economy shrank at a rate of 6.8 percent in the quarter ended June 30, compared to the same quarter last year. This is its biggest contraction since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, according to media reports published Tuesday.
Caused largely by a sharp hike in the consumption tax, or sales tax, in April, Japan’s domestic private consumption, which constitutes 60 percent of its economic activity, fell by 5 percent against the previous quarter, BBC reported Wednesday. A drop in economic output was expected after the nation's consumption tax was increased in April to 8 percent from 5 percent. According to economists polled by Reuters, the country's economy was expected to shrink by 7.1 percent in the quarter as a result of the tax hike.
This was the first time Japan raised the consumption tax in 17 years and is an attempt by the Shinzo Abe-led government to rein in public debt by increasing government revenue. However, the steep fall in growth compared to the previous quarter -- when the economy grew at an annualized rate of 6.1 percent -- took some economists by surprise.
Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Japan-based Mizuho Securities, told The Wall Street Journal that the country’s economy could remain sluggish for longer than expected.
""The next focal point is how much the economy will rebound in the July-September period. If the upward pressure is weak, it will likely increase the chance that Prime Minister Abe decides in December to delay the next sales-tax hike,"" Ueno said.
Abe had earlier said that he would raise the consumption tax further to 10 percent in October 2015.

However, Akira Amari, Japan’s minister of state for economic and fiscal policy, reportedly expressed confidence that the economy would pick up later in the year.
""Japan's economy continues to recover moderately as a trend and the effect of the sales tax hike is subsiding,"" he said.
In a statement released last week, the Bank of Japan had announced that it would keep its monetary policy unchanged, and would continue to increase the country’s monetary base by 70 trillion yen, or $687 billion, annually, underscoring the central bank's conviction that no fresh near-term stimulus was needed to shake off the effects of a consumption tax hike.

""Some members held a more cautious view of the outlook for prices compared with the forecasts in the baseline scenario, mainly because there seemed to be a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the view that the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI would reach around 2% around the middle of the projection period (to fiscal 2016),"" the minutes showed.
In July, the BoJ decided by a unanimous vote to leave the bank's policy target unchanged as expected, maintaining its overall economic assessment."

Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased to a seasonally adjusted 4.67 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey on Tuesday. That was the highest level since February 2001.
Hiring, which is being closely being watched for signs of a pick-up in job growth, rose to its highest level since February 2008. Much of the increase in employment growth has been driven by a sharp decline in the pace of layoffs.
The report is one of the indicators being closely watched by Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and other policymakers at the U.S. central bank.
The rise in job openings and hiring in June could fan speculation on the timing of the first interest rate increase from the Fed.

""The trajectory in improvement in the labor market we have seen continues. The question is whether we have more traction going into the second half of the year,"" said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2014 01:41PM ET</span>",U.S. productivity bounce-back keeps wage pressures tame,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Productivity at U.S. nonfarm businesses rebounded strongly in the second quarter, putting a lid on wage pressures and giving the Federal Reserve room to keep interest rates low for a while.
The Labor Department said on Friday productivity increased at a 2.5 percent annual rate after contracting at a revised 4.5 percent pace in the first quarter. The first quarter's drop was the sharpest since the fourth quarter of 1981.
The bounce back kept labor-related production costs in check. They had surged at the start of the year as an unusually cold winter depressed output.
Unit labor costs, the price of labor for any given unit of production, rose at a 0.6 percent rate, braking sharply from an upwardly revised 11.8 percent pace in the first quarter.
""The key message here is that labor costs remain subdued and unlikely to represent a source of rising production costs and or inflationary pressures any time soon,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.
The Fed is keeping a close eye on wage growth as it ponders when to raise benchmark interest rates, which it has kept near zero since December 2008. Investors do not expect a rate increase until around the middle of next year.
With productivity stepping up, there is more room for workers to win wage hikes without pressuring inflation or profits. Compared to the second quarter of last year, unit labor costs were up just 1.9 percent, below the central bank's 2 percent inflation target.
Even so, pay is accelerating.
The report showed compensation per hour increased at a 3.1 percent rate in the second quarter, and was up by the same amount from a year earlier. In comparison, hourly compensation advanced only 1.1 percent last year.
COMPENSATION RISING
Other gauges, such as the government's measure of personal income and its employment cost index, a broad gauge that is one of Fed Chair Janet Yellen's favorites, have also pointed to some firming of wage pressures.
""Today's report doesn't say that labor costs are a problem yet, but it hints at some improvement in pay,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Fed members, at least the inflation hawks, will likely look at the report as supporting their view that it is time to change direction.""
It is unlikely that productivity will continue to advance at the second quarter's pace. Over the past three years, it has never topped 1 percent on an annual basis.
""Unless productivity growth shows signs of accelerating in the near future, labor costs could begin to put some pressure on profit margins,"" said Alan MacEachin, an economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.
The second-quarter rebound reflected a sharp step up in gross domestic product in the second quarter. The government said last week that the economy grew at a 4.0 percent rate after shrinking at a 2.1 percent pace in the first quarter.
The second-quarter growth estimate, however, is likely to be trimmed when the figures are revised later this month, with a report on Friday from the Commerce Department showing only a moderate gain in wholesale inventories in May and June.

Economists said slow wholesale restocking could lower the second-quarter GDP estimate by as much as three-tenths of a percentage point, although data earlier this week showing a smaller trade gap should help offset that a bit.

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 08, 2014 02:57AM ET</span>","China posts record trade surplus, but domestic economy may lag","By Kevin Yao and Xiaoyi Shao BEIJING (Reuters) - China's buoyant exports pushed its trade surplus to a record in July, fuelling optimism global demand will help counter pressure on the domestic economy from a weakening property sector.
While manufacturing appears to have picked up in the world's second-largest economy, unexpected weakness in the services sector this week has renewed concerns about the growth outlook. The weak housing market remains China's biggest risk, posing a drag on the broader economy and investor confidence.
Recovering global demand may not be enough to bolster a weak internal economy weighed by a cooling property sector and Beijing's anti-corruption drive, suggesting policy support will likely continue to keep economic growth on track, analysts say.
Exports in July jumped 14.5 percent from a year earlier - the fastest pace in 15 months, the General Administration of Customs said on Friday, doubling from 7.2 percent in June and roundly beating market expectations. Exports were stronger than expected even after pricing in inflated export data in early 2013, when firms falsified invoices to skirt capital curbs.
Some analysts attributed the export spurt to delayed shipments caused by recent volatility in the yuan which may not sustain. Meanwhile, imports fell 1.6 percent versus a rise of 5.5 percent in June, leaving the country with a record trade surplus of $47.3 billion for the month.
""The (export) data indicates very strong demand externally and less need for a weak currency,"" said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
""However, imports contracted 1.6 percent year-on-year, indicating soft domestic demand and a downward pressure on growth. Policymakers are likely to do more to support the domestic economy.""
A Reuters poll had predicted a 7.5 percent rise in exports, a 3 percent increase in imports and a trade surplus of $27 billion.
Financial markets firmed on the data with the Shanghai Composite Index rebounding. It rose 0.25 percent by midday from its intraday low, when it was down 0.32 percent.
STRONG EXPORTS, WEAK IMPORTS
After a weak start this year, China's exports have shown signs of improvement helped by stronger global growth as well as supportive domestic policies and the effects of a weaker yuan.
Exports to the United States, China's top export destination, rose 12.3 percent in June, quickening from a rise of 7.5 percent in June, while those to the European Union, the second-biggest market, grew 17 percent, compared with 13.1 percent in June.
Exports to ASEAN countries rose 11.9 percent in July, accelerating from 9.7 percent in June, the customs data showed.
Customs spokesman Zheng Yuesheng told state television that China exports are likely to stay strong in the coming months.
""The external demand is improving as a recovery in major developed countries underpins the global economy,"" he said.
Imports from China's largest source for resources, Australia, dropped 5.7 percent, partly due to softer commodity prices but the fall adds to questions over the health of domestic demand.
Some analysts attributed weak imports to the crackdown on commodity financing following the Qingdao port fraud probe.
Combined exports and imports grew 2 percent in the first seven months from a year earlier, trailing far behind the government's full-year target of 7.5 percent.
The record trade surplus and pressure from capital inflows were seen renewing pressure on the yuan. The currency is poised for its third consecutive day of gains as the central bank signaled it was comfortable with stronger levels as the economy was improving.
""With Chinese economic activity improving, we believe that there is scope for RMB to further appreciate, driven by conversion of onshore FX deposits and increased foreign portfolio inflows,"" analysts at ANZ said in a note.
That could create a fresh headache for China's central bank, which intervened to weaken the currency earlier this year when it punished speculators betting on one-way yuan appreciation.
Chinese leaders have pledged to maintain pro-growth policies to help achieve the annual growth target of 7.5 percent.
The government unveiled a burst of ""targeted"" policy stimulus since April, including cutting reserve requirements for some banks, hastening construction of railways and public housing and allowing local governments to loosen property curbs.
The Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, said last month that China must maintain a ""certain speed"" in its development over the long term to help resolve problems in the economy

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 07, 2014 09:12AM ET</span>",U.S. jobless claims fall; four-week average hits 8-1/2-year low,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, pointing to a further strengthening of labor market conditions. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased by 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 289,000 for the week ended Aug. 2, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 
The prior week's claims were revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 305,000 for the week ended Aug. 2. Volatility related to the summer automobile plant shutdowns for retooling pushed claims to a 14-year low in July. 
Most of that volatility has worked its way through the data. The four-week average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 4,000 to 293,500, the lowest level since February 2006. 
A Labor Department analyst said there were no special factors influencing the state level data. 
""The underlying trend seems to be improvement in payrolls. The slower pace of claims would be consistent with that,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. 
U.S. stock index futures held gains, while prices of U.S. Treasuries turned flat, paring earlier gains, after the claims data. The U.S. dollar was trading higher against the euro. 
Claims are now at levels where the scope for further declines is limited as the labor market normalizes. As such, hiring will need to pick up significantly for job growth to accelerate. 
The slow pace of layoffs as well as steady hiring are helping to strengthen labor market conditions, fanning speculation of an early interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve. 
But with the ranks of the long-term unemployed, discouraged job seekers and part-time workers still large, the U.S. central bank has given little indication it is in a hurry to lift its benchmark interest rate, which it has kept near zero since December 2008. 
Fed officials last month acknowledged the improvement in labor market conditions, but said ""significant underutilization of labor resources"" remained. 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 209,000 in July, marking the sixth straight month that employment expanded by more than 200,000, a stretch last seen in 1997. The unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 6.2 percent as more people entered the labor force in search of work. 
Thursday's jobless claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped by 24,000 to 2.52 million in the week ended July 26. 

The unemployment rate for people receiving jobless benefits was 1.9 percent for the fourth week in a row.

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 06, 2014 11:33AM ET</span>","U.S. trade gap at five-month low, to boost second-quarter GDP","By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than expected in June as petroleum imports dropped to a 3-1/2-year low, suggesting that trade was less of a drag on second-quarter economic growth than initially thought.
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday the trade gap shrank 7.0 percent to $41.5 billion, the lowest reading since January. That was smaller than the roughly $44.8 billion shortfall the government had assumed in its first snapshot of second-quarter gross domestic product published last week.
""The improvement in June could mean a modest upward revision to the second-quarter GDP estimate,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. ""It also implies a fairly strong hand-off to third-quarter GDP.""
When adjusted for inflation, the deficit narrowed to $48.8 billion from $52.0 billion in May. As a result, economists expect the GDP growth estimate for the April-June quarter to be raised by as much as 0.3 percentage point later this month.
The government estimated a week ago that trade subtracted 0.61 percentage point from growth in the April-June period. In that report, it said the economy expanded at a 4.0 percent annual rate during that quarter after shrinking 2.1 percent in the first three months of the year.
Economists had expected a trade gap of $44.7 billion in June, a slight widening from the previously reported $44.4 billion May shortfall. The May gap was revised to $44.7 billion.
Imports fell 1.2 percent in June, the largest drop in a year, to $237.4 billion. That came as petroleum imports declined to $27.4 billion, the lowest level since November 2010, from $28.3 billion in May.
SHALE BOOM
A domestic energy boom has seen the country reduce its dependence of foreign oil. In June, the petroleum deficit fell to its lowest level since May 2009.
Non-petroleum imports were also weak, falling to $167.6 billion from $169.6 billion in May, suggesting a slower pace of inventory accumulation by businesses that month.
They were dragged down by declines in industrial supplies, capital goods, autos and consumer goods. Food imports, however, hit a record high. The decline in imports is at odds with strong manufacturing activity and relatively firm domestic demand.
""With the economy growing, consumer and business spending rising and vehicle sales robust, there is every reason to believe that imports will rebound going forward,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.
Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, said anecdotal reports pointed to some significant front-loading of imports through the West Coast in July ahead of a feared dock workers strike, which was avoided.
Exports edged up 0.1 percent to a record high of $195.9 billion in June, supported by a surge in automobiles, parts and engines, which rose to an all-time high.
Consumer goods exports also hit a record high. There was also a jump in crude oil exports.
""We still see net exports on pace to contribute to third-quarter GDP,"" said Wieseman. Third-quarter growth estimates are currently around a 3 percent pace.
Exports to Canada hit an all-time high in June.
Exports to China rose 1.4 percent, while imports from that country increased 3.7 percent.

That left the politically sensitive trade gap with China at $30.1 billion, up 4.5 percent from May.

1281,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 06, 2014 10:30AM ET</span>","US Economy Growing Faster Than Expected As Americans Bought Fewer Foreign Electronics, Oil ","By Meagan Clark - New federal data showed Wednesday that the U.S. economy may be growing faster than economists expected, as Americans bought fewer foreign goods in June, like oil, cars and cell phones, and sold slightly more goods overseas, like civilian airplanes and pharmaceutical products.
The U.S. trade deficit, the dollar amount that imports’ value exceeds exports’ value and essentially what the country borrows to finance its purchases, shrank 7 percent to $41.5 billion, the smallest deficit since January, from May’s $44.7 billion. Sixty-six economists polled by Bloomberg had predicted a deficit of $44.8 billion.
This “means that second-quarter GDP growth, which was initially estimated to be 4 percent annualised, will be revised even higher, probably to about 4.2 percent,” Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note Wednesday.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated last week that the country’s economic output grew at 4 percent from April to June, based on incomplete data subject to revision.
The 1.2 percent drop in imports from May to June is the biggest in a year, with petroleum imports the lowest in more than three years as Texas, North Dakota and other oil-producing states continue pumping increasing amounts of shale oil. The decline in imports is a drop back after an unusually big surge in March and April, but surveys of factories and businesses show strengthening domestic demand, Ashworth said.
“We aren’t worried that the decline in imports reflects a weakening in spending at home,” he said.

Imports would have been even lower and exports higher if not for a 2.2 percent rise in food imports as a harsh winter nationally and a drought in the Southwest has upset farms. Exports edged up by 0.1 percent over the month, reflecting weak foreign demand for American products as the European economy sputters.
“Exports should continue to grow, but the evident strength in domestic demand suggests that the gain in imports will be even more rapid,” Ashworth said.
The trade balance also narrowed in May more than expected, to $44.4 billion from $47 billion in April. Exports rebounded by 1 percent in May after slipping 0.1 percent in April, while imports fell 0.3 percent in May after a 1.1 percent climb in April.

1301,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2014 10:05AM ET</span>","Sturdy U.S. services, factory data boost growth picture","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. services sector activity hit an 8-1/2 year high last month and factory orders surged in June, bolstering expectations of solid economic growth in the third quarter. 
Tuesday's reports added to employment and consumer spending data in suggesting sustained momentum in the economy that could bring the Federal Reserve closer to raising interest rates. 
""The economy is normal, and a normal economy requires a normal interest rate, not a zero interest rate,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. 
The Institute for Supply Management's services index rose to 58.7 last month from 56.0 in June. While the index only dates to 2008, an examination of subcomponents with a longer track record indicate that was the highest level of activity since December 2005. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. 
Activity in the sector, which accounts for more than 80 percent of the U.S. economy, was boosted by a jump in orders, which touched their highest point in nearly nine years. 
A sub-index gauging services industry employment also rose as did order backlogs, but export order growth moderated. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods increased 1.1 percent in June, more than reversing May's 0.6 percent decline. Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - a measure of business confidence and spending plans - hit a record high. 
Strong business investment is one of the key ingredients needed for robust economic growth and the surge will be welcomed by Fed officials as they weigh the course of monetary policy. 
Interest rate futures now point to a better-then-even chance the U.S. central bank will hike overnight rates in June of next year. It has held them near zero since December 2008. 
""We think the Fed will revise its guidance on the outlook for interest rates at the September policy meeting, leaving the door open for a rate hike as soon as March 2015,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. 
FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS 
The data helped lift the U.S. dollar to a 10-1/2 month high against a basket of currencies, while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. U.S. stocks fell as retailer Target (N:TGT) cut its second-quarter earnings estimate. 
A wealth of data have suggested the economy is firing on almost all cylinders. But businesses amassed huge piles of stocks in the second quarter, which they may need to work through before placing more orders. 
That could take some edge off growth in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 4.0 percent annual pace in the April-June period, and growth estimates for the third quarter are currently around a 3 percent rate. 
In June, factory orders rose across all categories, with bookings for electrical equipment, appliances and components recording their largest gain since November 2010. 
In another sign of strength, unfilled orders saw their largest rise in seven months. Orders for durable goods, which are expected to last three years and more, were revised to show a sturdy 1.7 percent gain instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent advance. 
Orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft increased 3.3 percent. These so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have increased 1.4 percent.

1303,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 05, 2014 09:56AM ET</span>","U.S. services sector growth dips in July, still strong: Markit","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The pace of growth in the U.S. services sector dipped in July compared to the previous month, but still posted its second-highest reading in 4-1/2 years, a survey showed on Tuesday. 
Financial data firm Markit said its final services Purchasing Managers Index hit 60.8 in July, down from the preliminary reading of 61.0, which was also the reading for June. 
The 61.0 print for June was the highest final reading for any month since the survey began in October 2009. A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity. 
""The services sector grew at a rapid pace, just slightly weaker than June's post-recession high, accompanied by a surge in factory production,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. 
""However, there are signs that growth could cool in coming months. The surveys indicate that the rate of job creation has waned, as have inflows of new business."" 
The new business component slipped last month to 57.3, compared to the preliminary reading of 57.6 and June's final 60.8. 

Confidence about the year-ahead business outlook in the services sector slipped to the lowest since November 2012. 
Markit's final composite PMI, a weighted average of its manufacturing and services indexes, hit 60.6 in July, also the second-highest final reading on record, versus 61.0 in June and a preliminary 60.9.

Housing activity remained by far the best performing construction category, with the latest rise in output the sharpest for over a decade.
Meanwhile, sharp increases in overall construction activity led to a new survey-record pace of job creation and a further rapid lengthening of suppliers’ delivery times in July.
Commenting on the report, Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit and author the report, said, “Overall the survey adds to the view that construction companies have performed impressively so far this summer, which raises the likelihood that the sands of time could wash away the construction weakness seen in the preliminary second quarter GDP release.”

The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the non-manufacturing sector slowed to 54.2 in July from June's 55, the National Bureau of Statistics said. 
A reading above 50 in PMI surveys indicates an expansion in activity while one below the threshold points to a contraction. 
The services PMI followed two manufacturing surveys released on Friday that showed China's factory sector posting its strongest growth in at least 1-1/2 years last month, cementing bets that the economy is gathering steam after a spate of stimulus measures. 
Yet despite the slight pull-back in the services PMI, other measures suggested companies remained confident. 
Sunday's survey showed a sub-index for business expectations rose to 63.9 last month from June's 62.9. 
The improving performance in the service industry is in line with a pick-up in the broader economy, where growth quickened to 7.5 percent in the second quarter from an 18-month low of 7.4 percent between January and March. 

China has unveiled a slew of modest stimulus measures since April to energise the economy, including relaxing the reserve requirements for some banks and hastening the construction of railways and public housing projects. 
The services sector, which accounted for 45 percent of China's gross domestic product in 2012 and roughly half of all jobs in the country, is expected to post steady growth in coming years as the economy matures.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2014 05:16PM ET</span>",U.S. auto sales fall short of expectations in July,"By Bernie Woodall, Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (N:F) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) posted stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. auto sales in July but most manufacturers on Friday reported gains below expectations as several months of strong demand pushed optimism too high.
Ford's sales were up 10 percent at 212,236, with Toyota's up 12 percent at 215,802 due to strong demand for their SUVs as well as offering larger discounts.
Industry sales were up 9 percent from last year to 1,433,016 vehicles, but that still fell short of the 11 percent gain analysts polled by Reuters had expected.
""Given the strength we saw over the last several months, the industry (growth) came back down at a little bit of a quicker pace than perhaps we had originally anticipated,"" said Alec Gutierrez, analyst with industry research firm Kelley Blue Book. ""I wouldn't say the industry missed the mark too egregiously.""
Toyota was the No. 2 seller in July, edging past Ford, which had held that spot for the first half of this year and for 2013 overall. General Motors Co (N:GM) remained in top place.
Incentives played a strong role in July sales.
Honda Motor Co (T:7267) was the only one of the top car companies to cut incentives from June to July, research firm J.D. Power said. Honda's July sales tumbled 8 percent to 135,908.
Average industry discounts last month rose slightly to just over $3,000 per vehicle, with Ford incentives averaging close to $3,919. Industry incentives were the highest since 2010, said Larry Dominique, president of research firm ALG.
GM, Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), Chrysler Group LLC (MI:FIA) and the Hyundai-Kia Group (KS:005380) all reported higher July sales that nonetheless failed to meet analysts' expectations. The sales were Hyundai's best for July ever, while GM, Ford and Chrysler saw their strongest results for the month since before the 2008 recession.
GM said July sales were up 9 percent at 256,160. Also reporting increases were Chrysler, up 20 percent at 167,667; Nissan, up 11 percent at 121,452; and Hyundai-Kia, up 4 percent at 119,320.
The Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, said sales fell 6 percent to 49,469.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said growth slowed further than expected as the annualized sales rate in the month fell to 16.48 million vehicles according to research firm Autodata, from 17 million in June. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the annualized rate in July to ease slightly to 16.7 million.
With generous credit terms drawing buyers to more expensive vehicles, transaction prices in July remained firm, averaging $32,556 per vehicle, KBB said.
Ford said average prices on its full-size F-Series pickups topped $40,000, while GM's Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra's average prices were close to $39,000.
Sales growth of full-size pickup trucks, a bellwether for the U.S. economy, slowed in July.
Sales of Ford's best-selling F-Series rose 5 percent to 63,240 vehicles. GM's full-size Silverado had flat sales at 42,097, while the Sierra was up 5 percent to 17,488. Chrysler's Ram pickup climbed 14 percent to 35,621.
In the luxury segment, Toyota's Lexus overtook Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) for the sales crown in July. Lexus sold 27,333 vehicles to 27,192 for Mercedes and 26,409 for BMW. It was the first time Lexus outsold its German rivals since August 2013, KBB said.
Gains in U.S. auto sales have been stronger than the overall economy since the recession. Still, the monthly figures provide an early glimpse into consumer spending.

Auto sales dropped to a low of 10.4 million vehicles in 2009 and have risen steadily since, in part because of easier credit and loans of up to 84 months. They reached 15.6 million last year.

That statistic is called, in economics, the employment to population ratio, and it quantifies the proportion of the 15-to-64-year-old working-age population that is employed.
Economists eye the employment-to-population ratio to gauge the nation's ability to maintain job growth and further quantify the strength of the recovery. Because the financial crisis and the recession so dramatically affected the labor market, economists have been watching the metric closely to discern any tipping points in hiring.
And in the latest report, there's still plenty of reason for concern. The data seem to suggest that while the U.S. is finally creating a pattern of 200,000-plus new jobs per month, a growing labor force is still at the mercy of corporations queasy about adding jobs.
According to Friday's report, ""The participation rate has been essentially unchanged since April. The employment-population ratio, at 59.0 percent, was unchanged over the month but has edged up by 0.3 percentage point over the past 12 months.""  
However, broken down by demographic sectors including race, gender and age, the results show a wide range of labor market conditions.

For instance, men of all ages and races are doing fairly well in the job market, with an employment to population ratio of 66 percent, up just a bit from 65.4 percent a year ago. However, when broken down by race, white men over 20 show a rate of 69.3 percent, almost a full 10 percentage points better than similarly-aged black men.
For Hispanic and Asian men in the same age group, the rates are 76 percent and 61 percent, respectively.
The employment to population among women of all ages and races, which outpaced that of men earlier in the recovery, now lags, coming in at 53.2 percent, almost flat with last year's 53.1 percent.

The real problems remain with unemployment among the young. With so many older, more experienced workers chasing still-scarce employment, the younger folks who would normally be entering the workforce and embarking on careers are being shut out of the job market.
The unemployment to population ratio for all people 16 to 19 years old moved a bit higher, to 33.4 percent, but that came off a very low year-ago figure of 32.8 percent. That figure, while low, is still higher than the rate for black or African American teenagers, which came in at a mere 20.2 percent, a decline from 20.7 percent in July 2013.
The only other group to see a decline in the employment to population ratio were Asian Americans, whose rate fell to 60.5% from 61.3 percent a year ago, and young Hispanic aged 16 to 19, whose rate fell to 25.7 percent from 27.3 percent.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2014 12:20PM ET</span>",Jobs data bolsters Yellen's argument on labor market slack,"By Jason Lange WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve has made a big bet that recovery of the labor market is a long way from creating a worrisome surge of inflation. A range of economic data on Friday suggested the Fed has been reading the odds well.
While the Labor Department's monthly employment report showed more than 200,000 jobs created for the sixth straight month, wages were about flat in the private sector and there was little improvement in America's blight of long-term unemployment.
The report supported Fed Chair Janet Yellen's view that a sharp drop in the unemployment rate over the last year has masked substantial weakness in the labor market. That could give Yellen room to keep interest rates at rock-bottom levels well into next year - without inflation becoming a threat.
""We need more wage growth to see a pickup in inflation,"" said Ryan Sweet, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
American workers, on average, earned $24.45 an hour in July, up only a penny from June. Over the last year, wages have grown just 2 percent, in keeping with where they have been stuck since late 2009. Before then, hourly earnings typically rose 3 percent or 4 percent a year.
One reason to be pessimistic about wage growth is that more workers appear to be searching for jobs.
The Labor Department said more than 300,000 Americans joined the workforce last month. That was the main reason the jobless rate ticked higher to 6.2 percent, and economists generally think a larger pool of labor will make raises harder to come by.
""Yellen can argue that there are still few signs of tightness in the labor market,"" said Jim Kochan, a market strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
The added workers in the labor force left a larger share of the population either employed or looking for work, pushing the so-called labor force participation rate higher to 62.9 percent.
Even though an aging population should be pushing the participation rate lower, it has been largely stable this year, suggesting more workers are restarting job hunts that were put off when the job market was more dire.
Just because individuals are seeking work does not mean they will find it anytime soon. The number of people unemployed for more than 26 weeks actually increased slightly in July to 3.1 million. Measured as a share of the workforce, the long-term unemployment rate held steady at 2 percent, more than twice its levels in 2005 and 2006.

The Labor Department also said a broader measure of unemployment increased slightly to 12.2 percent in July. This measure, known as the U-6 jobless rate, includes workers who would like a job but are not actively seeking one. The ranks of these workers increased in July, another example of ongoing slack in the labor market.

1334,By International Business Times,"<span>Aug 01, 2014 11:45AM ET</span>",Why The US Unemployment Rate Rose Though More People Got Jobs ,"By Greg Morcroft - There's a reason economics is called the dismal science. Sometimes it defies logic, and today's U.S. government report on U.S. labor conditions provides a good example; the economy added 209,000 new jobs in July, yet the unemployment rate ticked up to 6.2 percent.
So, what gives? The answer is actually pretty simple.
When the Labor Department collects data to compile the report, it uses two separate sets of questions and two different polling populations to reach its conclusions. The number of new jobs added is collected by asking companies about their hiring practice, while the unemployment rate is derived from data collected from households.
As the Labor Department explains the reports: 
The household survey and establishment survey both produce sample-based estimates of employment, and both have strengths and limitations. The establishment survey employment series has a smaller margin of error on the measurement of month-to-month change than the household survey because of its much larger sample size. An over-the-month employment change of about 100,000 is statistically significant in the establishment survey, while the threshold for a statistically significant change in the household survey is about 400,000. However, the household survey has a more expansive scope than the establishment survey because it includes self-employed workers whose businesses are unincorporated, unpaid family workers, agricultural workers, and private household workers, who are excluded by the establishment survey. The household survey also provides estimates of employment for demographic groups. 
In addition, July is typically a volatile month, with summer vacations and seasonal hiring messing with the data, and you have a pretty good answer for the apparent illogic of rising unemployment and job growth in the same time period.
There's also the element of whether people polled in the household survey report that they are looking for work or not. For instance, if people queried for the household survey reveal that they are out of work, but not actively pursuing a job, they are not considered unemployed. If they become more confident about job prospects before the following survey and decided to start looking for a job, they would be considered unemployed in the next survey.

Many economists have expected unemployment to rise a bit once the job market starts to improve because those who had stopped looking would begin job hunting again, and fall into the above scenario.
To reach the household survey's final unemployment calculation, its economists divide the number of people actually looking for work by the size of the overall workforce.
Among the highlights of Friday's jobs report,
Both the unemployment rate (6.2 percent) and the number of unemployed persons (9.7 million) changed little in July. Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed persons have declined by 1.1 percentage points and 1.7 million, respectively.  The civilian labor force participation rate, at 62.9 percent, changed little in July. The participation rate has been essentially unchanged since April. The employment-population ratio, at 59.0 percent, was unchanged over the month but has edged up by 0.3 percentage point over the past 12 months.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's final July reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 81.8, a touch below the 82.0 estimate and down from the final June reading of 82.5.
""What has recently dominated the attention of consumers is job and income growth,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
""Despite the recent improvement, consumers have yet to take recent economic gains to indicate that more robust growth in jobs and wages will be forthcoming.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 97.4 from 96.6, compared with a forecast of 97.1.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations fell for a third straight month, to 71.8 from 73.5. The subindex was slightly above an expected 71.5.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 209,000 last month after surging by 298,000 in June, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Data for May and June were revised to show a total of 15,000 more jobs created than previously reported, showing underlying momentum and taking some of the sting from the report.
U.S. stock index futures pared losses on the report, while the dollar fell to a session low against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt yields dropped.
""It's a goldilocks report for an economy that is steadily expanding but not lifting off. It will reinforce for now the Federal Reserve's commitment to a gradualist policy approach,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz in Newport Beach, California.
July marked the sixth straight month that employment has expanded by more than 200,000 jobs, a stretch last seen in 1997. The one tenth of a percentage point increase in the unemployment rate to 6.2 percent came as more people entered the labor market, a sign of confidence in employment prospects.
Average hourly earnings, which are being closely monitored as a potential signal of reduced slack that could prompt the Fed to raise rates, rose only one cent.
That left the annual rate of increase at 2.0 percent, still well below the levels that would make Fed officials nervous.
Fed officials on Wednesday cautioned that ""significant"" slack remained, signaling patience on the rate front.
A separate report from the Commerce Department showed inflation retreating in June. A price index for consumer spending, excluding food and energy, edged up 0.1 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in May.
The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, increased 1.5 percent in the 12 months through June, still below the central bank's 2 percent target.
Most economists look for the first interest rate increase in the second quarter of next year. [ECILT/US] The Fed has kept benchmark interest rates near zero since December 2008.
STILL GROWING
Economists polled by Reuters had expected payrolls to increase 233,000 last month and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 6.1 percent.
The cooling in hiring is unlikely to change perceptions about strong economic growth in the third quarter.
""It still points to a job market and an economy that is improving, but we also have the absence of wage pressures building, which is becoming another concern for investors,"" said Sean Lynch, managing director of global equity and research strategy at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Omaha, Nebraska.
The economy grew at a 4.0 percent annual pace in the second quarter after shrinking at a 2.1 percent rate in the first three months of year. While restocking by businesses lifted the figure, growth is seen remaining sturdy for the rest of 2014.
The jobless rate has declined from a peak of 10 percent in October 2009, but much of the drop has been because Americans have left the workforce.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, increased to 62.9 percent in July after holding at 62.8 percent for three consecutive months.
The jobs market took a step back last month. A broad measure of unemployment that includes people who want a job but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time jobs edged up to 12.2 percent after hitting its lowest level since October 2008 in June.
The ranks of the long-term unemployed swelled last month, which will catch the attention of policymakers. The length of time Americans are spending unemployed also rose in July after hitting its lowest level in more than five years in June.
Job gains were broad-based in July. Services industries employment accounted for the bulk of the gains, adding 140,000 positions. That compared to 232,000 jobs in June.
Manufacturing payrolls increased for the 12th month in a row, adding 28,000 jobs in July. Construction jobs advanced for the seventh consecutive month, with July payrolls rising 22,000. Government employment increased by 11,000 jobs.

China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.7 in July - the strongest since April 2012 and up from 51 in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday. Economists had expected a reading of 51.4.
The upbeat result was echoed in the HSBC/Markit China measure of manufacturing which climbed to an 18-month peak of 51.7, from June's 50.7. Anything above 50 in these surveys separates growth from contraction.
The reports added to evidence that Beijing's stimulus measures were gaining traction in the world's second-largest economy, and followed news that growth in the United States had rebounded from a winter lull.
""Taken literally, these PMIs signal an exceptionally strong start for third quarter growth in China,"" said Annette Beacher, head of Asia-Pacific research at TD Securities in Singapore.
""Each time the PMIs have printed around 51 to 52 in recent years, annual economic growth peaked at around 8 percent in the same quarter, and so we pencil that in as a starting point.""
ORDERS FLOOD IN
China was not alone in scenting better times ahead.
India's factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in 17 months in July as firms responded to burgeoning new orders by increasing output.
The HSBC PMI, compiled by Markit, rose to 53.0 in July from 51.5 in June, its highest since February 2013.
""A flood of new orders from both domestic and external sources has led to a surge in activity,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC.
""Details within the survey show that all monitored categories witnessed a rise in output and order flows.""
Adding to the promising omens for global trade, South Korea reported exports to the United States expanded by over 19 percent in July, the fastest clip in nine months.
Taiwanese manufacturers, who do much of the work on Apple's iPhones, reported a robust improvement in overall business conditions in July, with output, total new orders and new export orders rising sharply.
All of which helped offset a disappointing reading from Japan, which has been struggling to recover from a tax-induced slump in consumer spending.
The final Markit/JMMA Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell to a seasonally adjusted 50.5 in July, from a preliminary reading of 50.8 and a final 51.5 in June.
In a brighter sign, new export orders grew for the first time in four months, albeit modestly. Policymakers have been counting on an export rebound to help ease the pain from the sales tax hike, but shipments have been stubbornly weak.
PARSING PAYROLLS
For global financial markets, the quickening pulse in Asian trade was a welcome diversion from conflict in the Middle East and Ukraine, as well as Argentina's latest brush with default.
The U.S. factory survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) due later Friday is also expected to tick up to 56.0 in July, which would be the best reading so far this year.
It will be preceded by the ever-influential U.S. payrolls report for July which analysts expect will show another healthy gain of 233,000 net new jobs.
The unemployment rate is seen holding at 6.1 percent, which might be welcomed by investors worried that further tightening in the labor market might lead the Federal Reserve to lift interest rates earlier than otherwise.
Those concerns were inflamed on Thursday when data showed U.S. labor costs rose by the most in more than 5-1/2 years during the second quarter.

They also got some of the blame for a sell off on Wall Street that saw the S&P 500 suffer its biggest daily loss since April.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Aug 01, 2014 12:29AM ET</span>","China PMIs jump to multi-month highs in July, add to view economy is steadying","By Koh Gui Qing BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factories posted their strongest growth in at least 1-1/2 years in July as new orders surged to multi-month highs, two surveys showed on Friday, cementing bets that the economy is re-gaining momentum after a spate of stimulus measures.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) issued by the government climbed to a 27-month high of 51.7 in July, beating forecasts for 51.4.
A separate PMI published by HSBC/Markit also rose to 51.7, its best performance in 18 months.
A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity on a monthly basis, and below that a contraction.
Analysts welcomed the data as a sign that the world's second-biggest economy is enjoying a revival after a rocky spell prompted authorities to launch a volley of support measures, including increasing bank lending to spur growth.
Now that looser monetary policy is having its intended effect, some analysts questioned the need for more economic stimulus in China, at least in the near term.
""There is no reason in China to be concerned about growth right now,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics. ""It's a good time for policymakers to step back from stimulus and concentrate on reforms.""
Both surveys showed that the rebound in manufacturing was led by firmer domestic demand as new orders -- a proxy for domestic and overseas demand -- rose more sharply than new export orders.
The official PMI showed new orders jumped to 53.6 from June's 52.8, the best reading since May 2012. The HSBC/Markit PMI also showed the new orders sub-index jumping nearly two points to 53.3, a level last seen in March 2013.
Worried by a slowdown in the economy in the first quarter, China began easing policy in April by cutting taxes, hastening investment, and lowering the reserve requirement for some banks.
Bank lending, which is controlled by the government, is expected this year to hit levels unseen since the 2008/09 global financial crisis.
All of this should help China sustain its economic recovery, said Qu Hongbin, an analyst at HSBC.
""We expect the cumulative impact of these measures to filter through in the next few months and help consolidate the recovery,"" he said.
""LIKELY TO MEET GROWTH TARGET""
China's economy has had a rocky spell this year. Growth cooled to an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter, and it was only after the flurry of policy support that activity edged back up to 7.5 percent between April and June, in line with the government's 2014 GDP expansion target. And what started as a slowdown largely driven by unsteady foreign and domestic demand and investment has broadened to include a housing downturn, which in recent months has become the biggest threat to the economy. Average home prices fell in May for the first time in two years, while growth in land prices also slowed for the first time in two years in the second quarter. Although a retreat in the once-heated housing market is a welcome for Chinese since home prices are still near record highs, the cooldown is painful for policymakers since the sector accounts for roughly 15 percent of China's economic growth.
Some economists say the economic recovery still hinges on the magnitude of China's pro-growth steps, and whether the government can successfully curb the risks stemming from a cooling property sector. Indeed, in a sign that the recovery may still be patchy, a sub-index for employment in the HSBC/Markit PMI showed employment contracted for the ninth consecutive month in July as some companies laid off workers.
Premier Li Keqiang also said on Thursday that China has to work harder on reforming its economy in the northeastern region, where growth has lagged after regional governments cut state investment to re-orient the Chinese growth engine.
Following three decades of double-digit economic growth, China wants to re-make its maturing economy so that it relies not on investment and exports, but on domestic consumption for sustainable growth.
""Future policy depends on whether the cost of funding in China would continue to fall,"" said Zhou Hao, an economist at ANZ Bank in Shanghai.

""But it's clear that China's economic growth momentum has increased and it's very likely that this year's 7.5 percent growth target will be met.""

1369,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2014 08:40AM ET</span>","U.S. jobless claims up, but four-week average hits eight-year low","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, but the underlying trend pointed to a continuing strengthening of labor market conditions.
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 23,000 to a seasonally adjusted 302,000 for the week ended July 26, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
The prior week's claims were revised to show 5,000 fewer applications received than previously reported. Claims for the week ended July 19 were the lowest since May 2000.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 301,000. Summer automobile plant shutdowns for retooling cause volatility in claims around this time of the year as automakers sometimes keep assembly lines running. This throws off a model the government uses to adjust the data for seasonal variations.
The four-week average of claims, considered a better gauge of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,500 to 297,250, the lowest level since April 2006.
A Labor Department analysts said there were no special factors influencing the state level data.
Despite the increase last week, claims remain at levels consistent with strong job growth. The data has no bearing on July's nonfarm payrolls as it falls outside the survey window.
The government is expected to report on Friday that payrolls increased by 233,000 in July, according to a Reuters survey of economists.
While that would be a deceleration from June's hefty gain of 288,000 jobs, it would mark the sixth straight month that employment has expanded by more than 200,000, a stretch last seen in 1997.
Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday acknowledged the improvement in labor market conditions, but said ""significant underutilization of labor resources"" remained.
The claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid increased 31,000 to 2.54 million in the week ended July 19.

The unemployment rate for people receiving jobless benefits held at 1.9 percent.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2014 06:48AM ET</span>",Falling prices on radar as euro inflation drops again,"By Martin Santa 
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Annual inflation in the euro zone fell in July to its lowest since the height of the financial crisis in 2009, keeping the risk of deflation on policymakers' radar but unlikely to spur the European Central Bank into further policy action. 
The slowdown to 0.4 percent, coming amid subdued wage pressures despite a fall in unemployment to a near two-year low, will fuel concerns of a possible broad fall in prices across the 18-nation bloc. 
But much of the decline in inflation was down to a sharp fall in volatile energy prices, Thursday's data from EU statistics office Eurostat showed, and the ECB is still waiting to assess the impact of a batch of measures it presented in June to pep up a fragile economic recovery. 
""Today's figures don't give any assurance that the euro zone is already out of the deflation danger zone,"" said Peter Vanden Houte, chief euro zone economist at ING. 
""Moreover, with the escalating conflict with Russia dampening growth prospects, it seems unlikely that deflation fears will disappear any time soon."" 
Consumer prices rose at their lowest annual rate since October 2009 when they fell by 0.1 percent, Eurostat data showed. 
Core inflation - which excludes energy, food, tobacco and alcohol costs - was unchanged at 0.8 percent for the second month in a row. Energy prices fell 1.0 percent on the year. 
NO CHANGE AT ECB 
The ECB holds its next policy meeting next Thursday, and initial reactions in the market - where assets were little changed - and from analysts suggested the inflation numbers had not shifted expectations that monetary policy will stay put. 
""We believe that the ECB will sit tight through the rest of 2014,"" said Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS. 
ECB officials have said inflation expectations in the bloc remain in line with the bank's target of just under 2 percent over the medium term, even though the ECB sees inflation rising only slowly to 1.5 percent in the final quarter of 2016. 
Analysts see limited risks of outright deflation in the euro zone, amid expectations that energy prices may soon rise again and sharp food price disinflation be draw to a close. 
""We still expect the euro zone to avoid overall deflation,"" Archer added. 
ECB President Mario Draghi has said the central bank is ready to take further unconventional measures if needed, and said that quantitative easing - or money printing to buy assets - ""falls squarely in our mandate"". 
But the barriers to embarking on such a round of broad asset purchases are high, notably for some influential ECB policymakers such as Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann. 
WAGE PRESSURE LIMITED 
By country, Spain saw annual deflation of 0.3 percent in July, after the economy roared ahead in the three months to June at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis. 
In Germany, inflation eased to 0.8 percent, days after the ECB and the Bundesbank emphasized the need to raise wages in Europe's largest economy. 
Unemployment was unchanged in Germany in June, separate data from Eurostat showed on Thursday. But in the euro zone as a whole it dropped to 11.5 percent from 11.6 percent in May, the lowest rate since September 2012. 
Some 18.4 million people remain without a job in the single currency bloc and much stronger economic growth, combined with necessary structural reforms by the governments, is needed to kick-start a solid build-up of new employment. 

Among the rest of the bloc's five largest economies, unemployment fell in Italy, Spain and the Netherlands and rose in France.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 31, 2014 05:00AM ET</span>","German jobless, retail data point to strong domestic economy","By Michelle Martin BERLIN (Reuters) - German unemployment dropped more than expected in July and retail sales climbed in June, data showed on Thursday, spelling good news for private consumption which is expected to drive growth in Europe's largest economy this year.
Seasonally adjusted data from the Labour Office showed the number of people out of work decreased by 12,000 to 2.898 million. The consensus forecast in a Reuters poll had been for a drop of 5,000.
""The fundamentals for German household spending are very strong. Unemployment is at long-term lows, employment at highs. Wages are rising, inflation is very low and the uncertainty of the euro crisis has faded,"" said Christian Schulz, senior economist at Berenberg Bank.
German consumer morale rose to its highest level in more than 7-1/2 years heading into August as shoppers became more upbeat about their future income prospects than at any point since 1991, helped by a robust labour market and low inflation, which currently stands at just 0.8 percent in Germany.
The jobless rate was steady at 6.7 percent, setting Germany worlds apart from euro zone peers like Greece and Spain, where around one in four people continue to be unemployed.
But some companies are still slashing jobs in Germany. Firms ranging from lighting maker Osram Licht AG (DE:OSRn) and solar company SMA Solar (DE:S92G) to Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and industrial services group Bilfinger (DE:GBFG) have all announced they will be trimming their workforces.
Data from the statistics office showed German retail sales rose by 1.3 percent in June in real terms on the month - their strongest rise since January and potentially a result of Germans hitting the shops at the start of the soccer World Cup.
Schulz said retail sales had risen by 1.4 percent in the first half of 2014 compared with the same period earlier, suggesting they could grow by 2.8 percent this year.
""That is a very healthy clip which should make consumption a key driver of overall demand,"" he said.
The German economy grew at its fastest rate in three years in early 2014 but that was largely due to mild weather so it is expected to slow or even stagnate in the second quarter before picking up again in the third.

Other recent data has pointed to a slowdown, with exports, industrial orders and production all falling. Germany's VDMA engineering body has also slashed its output forecast for this year. Surveys have shown business and investor morale weakening but consumers remain a source of support.

1394,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 30, 2014 04:30PM ET</span>","Auto Industry's Contribution To GDP Is Up, By A Lot","By Angelo Young - Buried in Wednesday’s second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product numbers released by the Department of Commerce is data on how much the auto industry’s contribution to the economy has grown in recent years. Amid a robust post-recession auto-sector recovery fueled largely by cheap credit, the contribution to the U.S. economy from new and used motor vehicles and auto parts has risen by nearly one percentage point compared to the second quarter of 2011.  
Wednesday’s government data shows the American automotive marketplace contributed 0.42 of a percentage point of annualized growth to the nation’s 4 percent GDP growth in the second quarter, up from flat last year and negative growth in the same quarter of 2011.
Three years ago, the nation barely avoided a double-dip recession, after emerging in the second half of 2009 from the longest period of U.S. economic contraction in eight decades. Emerging from the Great Recession, the U.S. economy picked up in 2010 to nearly the level it is today. But then the economy hit a speed bump, slowing to less than 1 percent growth in the first quarter of 2011. The situation improved, consumer confidence rebounded and the auto industry began to speed up its recovery. This year, the number of new motor vehicle sales will return to pre-recession levels.
Helping to spur activity in the U.S. auto market have been record-low auto lending rates, which have pushed the total sum of loans to a record $902 billion, a 29 percent jump from just three years ago.
The rise in auto lending has caused some to wonder whether we’re experiencing a replay in the auto sector of the housing bubble that collapsed in 2007, sending the economy into a recession. The New York Times recently underscored the rise in subprime lending to low-income car buyers. As in the runup to the mortgage meltdown, banks and private equity firms are offering up cash to lend to high-risk borrowers (people with credit scores below 640) at high interest rates. Then these loans are bundled into bonds passed to insurance companies, mutual funds and public pension funds. Subprime auto loans have more than doubled since the end of the Great Recession.
Chris Stinebert, president and chief executive of the American Financial Services Association, which represents the consumer credit lenders, rejected the notion that a bubble was forming in the subprime auto lending market.
“An increase in subprime loans means that more working-class Americans have transportation when that could be the difference between having a job or not,” Stinebert wrote in a letter to the editor of the Times in response to the story, which reported that some banks are providing false data on loan applications to approve borrowers who clearly cannot pay back the loans they receive.

But whether or not poor people are being suckered into subprime auto loans they have no way of paying back, data from the Federal Reserve shows that total auto loan delinquencies (people who haven’t made a payment for 90 or more days) have declined by more than a third since the second quarter of 2011.
As long as lenders and investors see that more than 96 percent of auto loans payments are current, there will not be an incentive to curtail borrowing to keep the auto sector healthy. Automakers will announce their U.S. motor vehicle sales figures for July on Friday. The sector is expected have increased sales by at least 10 percent compared to the same month last year. If auto lending is in a bubble, it hasn’t burst yet.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2014 03:30PM ET</span>",U.S. economy back on track with strong second-quarter rebound ,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. economy rebounded sharply in the second quarter as consumers stepped up spending and businesses restocked, putting it on course to close out the year on solid footing. 
Gross domestic product expanded at a 4.0 percent annual rate after shrinking at a revised 2.1 percent pace in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. 
The government previously had said the economy contracted at a 2.9 percent rate at the start of the year. 
The second-quarter expansion was much stronger than the 3.0 percent economists had expected and added to manufacturing and services sector data in bolstering the outlook for the remainder of the year. 
""Today's report shows greater near-term healing and momentum, reducing the downside risks and leaving us comfortable with our forecast for above 3.0 percent growth through next year,"" said Michelle Meyer, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. 
Despite the pickup, growth in the first half of the year badly lagged the economy's estimated 2 percent to 2.5 percent potential, a reminder that the nation's recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s remains the slowest on record. 
A separate report showed private employers added 218,000 jobs to their payrolls this month, a decline from June's hefty gain of 281,000. Still, hiring remains solid and consistent with expectations for a stronger second half of the year. 
Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday acknowledged the improvement in the economy, but cautioned that labor market slack remained considerable. The U.S. central bank, following the end of a two-day policy meeting, announced a further reduction to the amount of money it is injecting into the economy through monthly bond purchases. 
The Fed is not expected to raise interest rates until next June. 
The GDP data buoyed the dollar, lifting it to a 10-month high against a basket of currencies as traders speculated about an early rate hike. 
Prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell, with the yield on the two-year note touching its highest level since 2011. U.S. stocks were trading mixed. 
ECONOMY IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE 
""We do not feel the report calls for pulling forward the Fed rate hike. The first quarter's bad weather didn't change the story, but simply delayed when that train gets to the station,"" said Tim Hopper, chief economist at TIAA-CREF in New York. 
  The government also published revisions to prior GDP data going back to 1999, which showed the economy performing much stronger in the second half of 2013 and for that year as a whole than previously reported. 
The economy in the second quarter was buoyed by consumer spending and a swing in business inventories. 
Consumer spending growth, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, accelerated at a 2.5 percent pace, as Americans bought long-lasting manufactured goods, mostly automobiles, and spent a bit more on services. 
It had braked to a 1.2 percent pace in the first quarter because of weak healthcare spending. 
Despite the pick-up in consumer spending, Americans saved more in the second quarter. The saving rate increased to 5.3 percent from 4.9 percent in the first quarter as incomes rose, which bodes well for future spending. 
Inventories contributed 1.66 percentage points to GDP growth after chopping off 1.16 points in the first quarter. 
The economy also received a boost from business investment, government spending and investment in home building. 
Trade, however, was a drag for a second consecutive quarter as some of the increase in domestic demand was met by a surge in imports. Domestic demand rose at its fastest pace since the third quarter of 2011. 
Solid domestic demand, which underscores the economy's firming fundamentals, led to some pick-up in price pressures in the second quarter. The Fed on Wednesday signaled more comfort that inflation was moving up toward its 2 percent target. 
A price index in the GDP report rose at a 2.3 percent rate in the second quarter, the quickest in three years, after advancing at a 1.4 percent pace in the prior period. 
A core price measure that strips out food and energy costs increased at a 2.0 percent pace, the fastest since the first quarter of 2012. 

""The inflation picture should lend support to the Fed hawks who want to hike interest rates sooner rather than later,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University Channel Islands in Camarillo.

1396,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 30, 2014 02:19PM ET</span>","Fed leaves rates unchanged, trims easing program by $10 billion","Investing.com - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it was leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.00-0.25% and added it would cut its monthly bond-buying program to $25 billion from $35 billion.
The Fed said the overall economy is improving, though slackness remains in the labor market despite growth, which prompted monetary authorities to continue tapering its asset-purchasing program by $10 billion per policy meeting.
""Labor market conditions improved, with the unemployment rate declining further. However, a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources,"" the Fed's statement read.
Household spending is on the mend while business fixed investment is advancing, although recovery in the housing sector remains slow.
Fiscal policy continues to weigh on growth though the extent of which is diminishing, while consumer prices are stable.
""Inflation has moved somewhat closer to the Committee's longer-run objective. Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable,"" the statement read.
""The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat.""
The statement came hours after the Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 4.0% in the three months to June, blowing past forecasts for a 3.0% reading. The contraction in the first quarter was revised to 2.1% from a previously reported 2.9%.
Personal consumption grew 2.5%, well above predictions of 1.9%, the report said, adding to the view that the economic recovery is gaining traction.
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser dissented, indicating that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for ""a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends,"" because such language is time dependent and does not reflect the considerable economic progress that has been made toward the Committee's goals, the statement read.
The US Dollar Index, which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.26% at 81.52.

1397,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 30, 2014 12:00PM ET</span>",EU Electric Car Sales Doubled In 2013,"By Maria Gallucci - New battery-powered cars from Renault (PARIS:RENA), Volvo (ST:VOLVAs) and Mitsubishi Motors (TOKYO:7211) helped to double sales of electric vehicles in Europe last year, a new analysis found. But automakers still face major hurdles in moving these alternative models, including high costs and consumer anxiety.
Nearly 50,000 plug-in vehicles were sold in the European Union in 2013, up from 22,000 in 2012, according to an analysis of official data by the Transport & Environment (T&E) advocacy group, the Guardian reported. Renault’s Zoe, Volvo’s V60 plug-in and Mitsubishi’s Outlander together comprised nearly half of last year’s sales, or about 8,000 models each.
The leading models in 2012 – Opel’s Ampera and Puegeot’s Citroen iOn/C-zero – meanwhile saw their sales drop sharply. “What you are seeing is better cars and better services being offered to the market,” Greg Archer, the clean vehicles program manager at (T&E), told the Guardian.
Overall, electric vehicles accounted for about 0.4 percent of new car sales in Europe last year. In the United States, by comparison, 0.6 percent of total passenger car and light truck sales in 2013 were plug-in models – about 96,000 vehicles.
“Electric cars are growing strongly, but at the same time the simple truth is that they are too expensive for most people to consider,” Archer told the Guardian. Volvo’s V60 plug-in, for instance, cost from £44,275 ($75,000) after a £5,000 ($8,500) UK government subsidy, while Mitsubishi’s Outlander priced at about $47,800 after subsidy and Renault’s Zoe cost around $24,000 after subsidy.

U.S. car buyers can obtain federal tax credits worth up to $7,500 when they buy a plug-in model, and some state governments offer additional incentives. Tesla Motors NASDAQ:TSLA's Model S luxury sedan is priced from $71,000 domestically, while the all-electric Nissan Leaf and plug-in hybrid Chevy Volt each cost around $30,000.
Still, Archer said such government subsidies aren't sustainable in the long-run, and that a more effective way to get automakers to produce electric cars would be to force them to slash greenhouse gas emissions across their entire fleet. In the United States, car manufacturers are now required to nearly double the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks by 2025, to 54.5 miles per gallon, but automakers in Europe are resisting attempts to adopt emissions standards on the continent, the Guardian noted.
Transportation accounts for about one-fourth of total emissions in Europe and one-third of emissions in the United States.
Archer said that while electric vehicles are important for reducing transportation pollution, improvements in diesel and gas-powered cars are even more critical in the near-term. ""We will not see large numbers of electric cars on the roads for a decade, so we need to see other steps as well,"" he said."

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2014 06:20AM ET</span>","Euro zone sentiment, inflation expectations edge up in July","By Martin Santa BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Euro zone economic sentiment unexpectedly improved in July while inflation expectations among consumers and companies edged up, data from the European Commission showed on Wednesday.
Consumer morale rose in three of the euro zone's five biggest economies, led by Italy and followed by France and the Netherlands, while the bloc's growth engine Germany and Spain saw sentiment worsening.
The monthly economic sentiment index for the 18 countries sharing the euro rose to 102.2 in July from a revised 102.1 in June. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a drop to 101.8 in July.
While industry confidence rose on optimism about future production, confidence in the services sector declined as demand expectations weakened. Worries about jobs and the economic outlook meanwhile hit consumer confidence, the Commission said.
Consumers' inflation expectations improved marginally to 8.7 in July from 8.6 in June while companies' outlook for selling prices returned to positive territory in July for the first time in seven months.
The 9.6 trillion euro economy is still struggling to get onto a solid footing after exiting recession a year ago, with the European Union's toughening of sanctions against Russia adding to risks the fragile recovery could stall.
Last month, the European Central Bank launched broad measures to aid growth and avert deflation risks in the bloc, and said it could yet print money to support the economy.

Measures announced by Europe and the United States on Tuesday will target Russia's energy, banking and defense sectors in the strongest international action yet over Moscow's support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.
Separately, the Commission's business climate indicator, which points to the phase of the business cycle, fell to 0.17 in July from 0.21 in June, its worst reading since October 2013.
Data earlier on Wednesday showed Spain's economy grew at its fastest pace since before the financial crisis in the second quarter, although monthly consumer prices fell at their sharpest year-on-year rate in July since October 2009.
The Spanish inflation reading will be followed at 1200 GMT (8.00 a.m. EDT) by corresponding numbers for Germany, the biggest economy in the euro zone. German inflation is forecast to have risen 0.2 percent month-on-month and 0.8 percent year-on-year in July.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 30, 2014 02:40AM ET</span>","China's local GDP data points to recovery, rebalancing","By Aileen Wang and Koh Gui Qing BEIJING (Reuters) - China's regional economies enjoyed a revival in growth in the second quarter, data from provincial governments showed, chiming with earlier figures that suggest a burst of government stimulus measures is re-invigorating activity.
Of the 30 regions and provinces that released their local gross domestic product (GDP) data, 23 reported first-half economic growth accelerated from the first quarter.
About three-quarters posted growth that was higher than the national average of 7.4 percent in the first six months.
Growth also diverged sharply between eastern and western China. The coastal and northeastern regions fared the worst, while activity was most buoyant in the central and western areas, where double-digit growth rates were concentrated.
Analysts said this suggested China's bid to rebalance its economy is paying off.
From redefining job targets to shifting investment to inland areas and cutting obsolete capacity in energy-guzzling sectors in the north, China wants to overhaul the world's second-largest economy and encourage more sustainable and higher-quality growth.
""The growth gap is an expected result of Beijing's efforts to rebalance regional economies and let the fruits of growth be more evenly shared by the poorer inland regions,"" said Nie Wen, an analyst at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai.

In Hebei -- China's top steel producer -- for instance, GDP growth stayed sluggish in the first six months, even though activity picked up slightly to 5.8 percent compared with 4.2 percent in the first quarter.
Hebei's drowsy performance is in part due to its efforts to remake itself. Hebei wants to slash total steel capacity by 60 million tonnes by 2017 and to shut more outdated steel mills this year to cut air pollution in northern China.
Similarly in the northeastern Heilongjiang province, the only province that has not released its GDP data, a local statistician who declined to be identified said first-half GDP growth was likely to be the lowest in China at under 5 percent.
A hub for China's heavy industry and a major coal producer, Heilongjiang was also the weakest performer in the first quarter, when its GDP growth fell to 4.1 percent.
INLAND REGIONS OUTPACING
In contrast, economies in the west such as Chongqing, Guizhou and Qinghai all posted double-digit GDP growth between January and June, helped by policy support. Just last month, Premier Li Keqiang had vowed to sink more cash into the industries and infrastructure in western China.
""Most of Beijing's recent piecemeal pro-growth measures have targeted the central and western provinces,"" Nie said.
Meanwhile, the biggest export-oriented provinces of Guangdong and Zhejiang saw GDP growth slacken in the first-half of 2014 to between 7 percent and 7.5 percent.
Cooling growth along China's eastern coast is in line with Beijing's goal of cutting its economic reliance on exports in favor of a more sustainable expansion in domestic consumption.
Data earlier this month showed China's economic growth quickened to 7.5 percent in the second quarter, as a raft of stimulus measures helped lift the pace from an 18-month low of 7.4 percent between January and March.
Still, a Reuters poll this month found that China's economy is forecast to grow 7.4 percent this year, the slowest pace in 24 years, and many economists believe more government measures may be needed to maintain its momentum.
In eastern Shandong province, growth edged up to 8.8 percent in the first half from 8.7 percent in the first quarter, but strains are evident from the earlier slowdown in growth, government efforts to reduce excess capacity and a cooling property market.
The amount of bad bank loans in the province surged 25.8 percent between January and June this year, the official Financial News reported last week.
Many economists see the property slowdown as the key risk to national and regional economies this year. A growing number of cities and local governments have eased restrictions on property purchases in recent months to shore up revenues and boost economic activity.

1422,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2014 05:20PM ET</span>","U.S. home prices down in May, but consumer confidence strong","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. single-family home prices fell unexpectedly in May, declining for the first time in more than two years in the latest signal of the wobbly state of the housing market.
Still, U.S. consumers remained confident in the broader economic picture, with a key measure of consumer attitudes at its highest since October 2007 and views of the job market the brightest in six years.
The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas declined 0.3 percent in May on a seasonally adjusted basis, its first fall since January 2012. A Reuters poll of economists forecast a gain of 0.2 percent.
""The slowdown in price appears to be indicative of the weakening in housing activity more generally, particularly after the very slow start to the spring selling season,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
""However, while we are not particularly alarmed by the surprising drop in home prices, this report adds to a growing list of housing indicators that are beginning to point in the wrong direction, which could be a early warning signal that all may not be well in this crucial segment of the economy.""
Meanwhile, U.S. homeownership rates continue to decline as financially squeezed Americans opt to rent, a separate report from the Commerce Department showed Tuesday. The seasonally adjusted homeownership rate fell to 64.8 percent in the second quarter of 2014 from 65.0 percent in the first quarter, marking the lowest level since the second quarter of 1995.
The U.S. housing market has been struggling for much of 2014, a lull blamed early in the year on harsh winter weather, but softness has persisted into the spring and summer, and many economists now expect housing to drag on economic growth this year.
""Housing has been turning in mixed economic numbers in the last few months,"" said David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement.
""Prices and sales of existing homes have shown improvement while construction and sales of new homes continue to lag.""
Indeed, data last week showed sales of new homes fell 8.1 percent in June. Measures of new home construction - building permits and housing starts - also fell sharply last month. Sales of previously owned homes, however, rose 2.6 percent in June, but that was down sharply from May.
Investors appeared to focus more on Tuesday's confidence data, with the S&P 500 up 0.25 percent and an index tracking home builders rising as well. The PHLX housing sector index advanced 1 percent.
Bond prices, meanwhile, were generally higher, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield, which moves in the opposite direction to its price, falling to 2.47 percent from 2.49 percent late on Monday.
CONFIDENCE SURGES
The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 90.9 in July, the highest level since October 2007, from an upwardly revised 86.4 the month before. Economists had expected a reading of 85.3, according to a Reuters poll.
The report showed consumers' view of the job market was the strongest since July 2008, when the recession was in its early stages and the full force of the financial crisis had yet to hit.
The Conference Board's ""Jobs Hard to Get"" index stood at 30.7 in July, unchanged from last month's downwardly revised figure. The related ""Jobs Plentiful"" index rose to 15.9 from 14.6 in June, marking that measure's highest reading since May 2008.
YEAR-OVER-YEAR HOME PRICE GROWTH SLOWS
Non-seasonally adjusted prices rose 1.1 percent in the 20 cities, compared to an expectation of a 1.5 percent rise.
Prices in the 20 cities rose 9.3 percent year over year, the slowest year-over-year gain since February 2013 and shy of expectations for a 10 percent climb.
The seasonally adjusted 10-city gauge fell 0.3 percent in May versus unchanged in April, while the non-adjusted 10-city index rose 1.1 percent in May compared to a 1 percent gain in April.
Year over year, the 10 city gauge rose 9.4 percent.

1425,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 29, 2014 03:57PM ET</span>",July Auto Sales Pumped By Borrowing,"By Angelo Young - Fueled by a record high level of borrowing for car purchases, Americans probably bought about 1.4 million motor vehicles this month, pushing sales up more than 10 percent from July 2013. By most forecasts this will be the best July on record since 2006, two years before the subprime mortgage meltdown sent the auto industry into crisis.
The actual July 2014 figures will be announced Friday, Aug 1.
“Shoppers are looking past news of recalls and rising gas prices and they’re finding affordable interest rates and other incentives that make it easier to buy a new car,” Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst for automotive pricing and information provider Edmunds.com, said in an email.

The seasonally adjusted annualized rate, an important monthly snapshot of a 12-month running average, is seen coming in between 16.5 million and 16.8 million, well above the 16.1 million reached in 2007 before the collapse of the auto industry send annual sales to 10.4 million in 2009. This year, new auto sales in the U.S. will finally reach pre-recession levels.
But at what cost?
According to Equifax, a credit reporting agency, auto lending hit an all-time high of $902 billion in the first half of the year, a 10 percent jump from the same period last year.

""Auto lending continues to thrive, accounting for more than 50 percent of all new non-mortgage lending through April of 2014,"" Dennis Carlson, economist at credit reporting agency Equifax, said in a statement announcing the latest data. Helping this lending surge: record low rates under the Fed’s quantitative easing policy of buying up debt and lending money to banks at near-zero percent interest.

“When the bubble pops, the effect won't simply come in the form of losses on the loans themselves,” Edward Niedermeyer, an auto industry consultant, writes in Bloomberg View. “As repossessed vehicles flood the market, used vehicle values will drop to the point where they begin to lower new car demand. By juicing short-term sales, automakers and new-car dealers have been robbing from their own futures.”
If the bubble bursts, not only will the market be flooded with repossessed vehicles, but as reported recently in the New York Times, insurance companies, mutual funds and public pensions that have been buying bonds backed by subprime lending (giving loans at higher rates to consumers who have a high risk of default) could lose fortunes as they did buying home-mortgage backed securities in the runup to the Great Recession.

But for now, it’s party time. Equifax says auto lending delinquencies remain low, and as long as they stay there auto manufacturers, suppliers and dealers will continue to see sales growth.
Chrysler Group LLC, the Auburn Hills, Michigan, company owned by Italy’s Fiat (MILAN:FIA), has been enjoying strong demand for its Jeep brand. The newly redesigned Chrysler 200 mid-sized sedan that recently went on the market will help momentum.
“Fiat-Chrysler is projected to post the largest increase in sales amongst the major automakers,” Jesse Toprak, chief analyst for online car seller and auto marketing company Cars.com, said by email.

General Motors (NYSE:GM) is expected to boost sales in July by more than 10 percent despite the raft of auto-safety recalls of about 30 million of its vehicles, mostly in the U.S. Despite the hit to some of GM’s Chevrolet sedan sales, the company’s new K2XX platform in its trucks and full-sized SUVs has attracted buyers to the company’s best-selling behemoths.  
Meanwhile, Volkswagen (XETRA:VOWG), the world’s second-largest automakers by deliveries, continues to rely on strength in Audi sales in the U.S. to offset losses in VW-branded sedans and compacts.
Nissan (TOKYO:7201) is seen dropping incentive spending the most compared to July 2013, according to a forecast from automotive data provider and online seller TrueCar.com, while the Hyundai Motor Co (KS:005380) and Kia Motors (KS:000270) are predicted to have led in industry in incentives growth. The more a company offers in sales incentives, such as rebates and zero-percent financing, the less it earn in profit for the sale.

So far this year, GM, Toyota Motor Corp. TYO:7203, Chrysler-Fiat, Nissan and Hyundai/Kia have increased sales while Honda Motor Co. Ltd. TYO:7267, Ford Motor Co. NYSE:F and Volkswagen have seen sales decline since last year. Overall the world’s “Big 8” auto manufacturers have increased sales by 3.7 percent in the first six months of the year.
Low interest rates have helped spur the rebound in the auto industry. The question is: What happens when, as expected, interest rates begins to rise. And perhaps more important: What will be the future impact on the industry of auto financing that is rapidly approaching a trillion dollars?

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2014 12:54PM ET</span>",Renting drives U.S. homeownership to 19-year low ,"By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Homeownership in the United States hit a 19-year low in the second quarter as tight finances continued to drive Americans toward renting, one of the lasting legacies of the recession. 
The seasonally adjusted homeownership rate fell to 64.8 percent, the lowest level since the second quarter of 1995, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. 
That compared to 65.0 percent in the first three months of 2014 and 65.1 percent a year ago. 
Economists said homeownership, which peaked at 69.4 percent in 2004, could fall even further as banks maintain stringent lending practices and wage growth remains tepid, despite an acceleration in job creation. 
""We are becoming more of a rental society. It's becoming harder to own a home,"" said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. ""People who lost their homes to foreclosure are now renting and credit standards have tightened significantly."" 
The 2007-2009 recession, sparked by the collapse of the U.S. housing market, has left the economy with deep scars that will take long to heal. Wage growth remains lackluster, even though the unemployment rate is at six-year lows and the economy has recouped all the jobs lost during the downturn. 
Weak wage gains have combined with higher mortgage rates and home prices to force many to give up on the American dream of home ownership, leading to a tightening of the rental market. 
In the second quarter, the residential rental vacancy rate dropped to 7.5 percent, the lowest level in more than 19 years. 
""That is not surprising, young adults are choosing to rent,"" said Yelena Shulyatyeva, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York. ""The shock from the financial crisis is still here."" 
The shift toward renting could further boost the construction of multi-family units and undermine the single-family segment, the biggest sector of the housing market. 
Multi-family starts have seen double digit growth over the last few years as developers scrambled to meet demand for rental units, while groundbreaking for single-family homes generally has been weak. This trend suggests the housing market recovery will remain sluggish for a while. 
In the second quarter, the number of occupied housing units - a gauge of household formation - increased 458,000 from a year ago. Economists said the increase was far below what would be needed to signal a strong housing recovery. 
""Historically that number has been over a million, it has to be over a million in order for the housing market to start growing significantly,"" said IHS Global Insight's Newport. 

""We are not seeing much growth in household formation, which means that young people graduating from college are moving in with their parents. That trend has not changed much and is the key reason why the housing recovery has been so weak.""

Another report on Monday showed services sector activity held at a 4-1/2 year-high in July, a sign of economic momentum early in the third quarter.
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, fell 1.1 percent to 102.7. The decline followed three straight months of increases.
Economists, who had expected contracts to rise 0.5 percent last month, were not fazed by the drop.
""The June pullback could be seen largely as a correction in a broadly improving trend, with housing data remaining somewhat choppy as the sector gradually continues to recover,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.
Pending home sales, which lead sales by a month or two, increased 6.0 percent in May. They were down 7.3 percent compared to June of last year. On a regional basis, contracts fell in the Northeast and the South, but rose in the West and the Midwest. 
U.S. stocks fell on the report, with the PHLX housing sector index declining 1.2 percent. Shares in the nation's largest home builder, D.R. Horton, shed 1.5 percent. Housing has been making gains after hitting a soft patch last summer following a run-up in mortgage rates. Existing home sales hit an eight-month high in June.
Mortgage rates have declined, with the 30-year fixed rate at 4.16 percent in June compared to a peak of 4.49 percent last September. The recovery, however, continues to be uneven, with new home sales having plummeted 8.1 percent last month.
The sector has been hampered by higher interest rates and a persistent shortage of properties for sale, which is putting upward pressure on prices and sidelining many first-time buyers.
IMPROVEMENT SEEN
""The lack of income growth with potential first-time buyers is problematic,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.
""But this should take a turn for the better next year with faster wage growth and looser credits. If housing doesn't reaccelerate, the economy won't grow faster.""

For now, the economy is pushing ahead. In a separate report on Monday, financial data firm Markit said its preliminary services Purchasing Managers Index was 61.0 in July, unchanged from June.
A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity, and June's reading was the highest final reading since the survey began in October 2009.
""Service sector companies continue to perform strongly against post-recession trends, and overall the latest manufacturing and services PMI surveys suggest that the economy has enjoyed a strong start to the second half of 2014,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist.
The government is expected to report on Wednesday the economy grew at a 3.0 percent annual pace in the second quarter after contracting at a 2.9 percent rate in the first three months of the year.

1439,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 28, 2014 10:01AM ET</span>",U.S. pending home sales fall 1.1% in June ,"Investing.com - Pending home sales in the U.S. fell unexpectedly in June, dampening optimism over the health of the housing sector, industry data showed on Monday.
In a report, the National Association of Realtors said its pending home sales index declined by a seasonally adjusted 1.1% last month, disappointing expectations for a 0.5% gain. Pending home sales in May rose by 6.1%.
Year-on-year, pending home sales fell at annualized rate of 4.5% in June, compared to expectations for a decline of 5.2%.
Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, says the housing market is stabilizing, but ongoing challenges are impeding full sales potential.
“Activity is notably higher than earlier this year as prices have moderated and inventory levels have improved,” he said.
“However, supply shortages still exist in parts of the country, wages are flat, and tight credit conditions are deterring a higher number of potential buyers from fully taking advantage of lower interest rates,” Yun added.
Following the release of the data, the U.S. dollar held on to losses against the euro, with EUR/USD rising 0.05% to trade at 1.3436.
Meanwhile, U.S. equity markets were lower after the open. The Dow dipped 0.3%, the S&P 500 declined 0.3%, while the NASDAQ Composite shed 0.25%.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2014 01:39PM ET</span>",U.S. business spending data gives mixed signals on growth,"By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A mixed reading on the health of U.S. business investment on Friday suggested the economy may not have rebounded as strongly in the second quarter as previously believed, but it offered hope for the rest of 2014.
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rebounded 1.4 percent after declining by a downwardly revised 1.2 percent the prior month, the Commerce Department said.
However, shipments of these so-called core capital goods fell 1.0 percent. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement.
It was the third month of decline in shipments, prompting some economists to temper their second-quarter growth estimates.
""The weak performance in core capital goods shipments during the quarter suggests that this segment of the economy is unlikely to contribute much to economic activity,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.
Morgan Stanley trimmed its second-quarter growth estimate by one-tenth of percentage point to a 3.2 percent annual rate, while JPMorgan lowered its forecast to 2.6 percent from 2.7 percent.
The government will release its first snapshot of second-quarter GDP next Wednesday. The economy contracted at a 2.9 percent rate in the first three months of the year, with business spending on equipment falling at a 2.8 percent rate.
But the swing back in core capital goods orders last month offered hope for growth in the third quarter. That trend, if sustained would be a boost to growth.
In addition, unfilled core capital goods orders increased a solid 1.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent in May.
""The momentum in core orders in the second quarter bodes well for equipment and software spending in the second half of the year,"" said Michael Gapen, a senior economist at Barclays in New York.
MAY ORDERS REVISED DOWN
Some economists, however, worry that business investment might not pick up much because of the sharp downward revision to May's core capital goods orders from the previously reported 0.7 percent increase.
""The weakness late in the quarter implies a soft trajectory for capital spending heading into the third quarter,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
""All in all, it's nice to see that capital expenditure has rebounded from its first-quarter hole, but the latest data do nothing to indicate that capital spending is about to shift into higher gear.""
Other details of the report painted a fairly upbeat picture of manufacturing, consistent with other data on factory activity. Orders for long-lasting manufactured goods increased 0.7 percent in June as demand increased from transportation to machinery and computers and electronic products.

The increase in orders for these goods, which range from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, followed a 1.0 percent drop in May.
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.8 percent last month after rising 0.7 percent in May, showing a building up of backlogs that will keep the nation's factories busy for a while.
Durable goods inventories rose 0.4 percent. That supports views inventories would be a boost to second-quarter growth. A slow pace of inventory accumulation was behind the sharp contraction in output in the first quarter.
""It is further encouragement that the economy will return to growth in the second quarter and should continue to be strong through the remainder of 2014,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

1457,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 25, 2014 01:59AM ET</span>",Japan consumer inflation eases in June as weak yen impact fades,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's core consumer inflation eased slightly in the year to June, highlighting the challenges the central bank faces in meeting its 2 percent inflation target sometime next year.
But the slowdown will come as no surprise to the Bank of Japan, which has said inflation will continue to slow to around 1 percent in coming months as an increase in import costs from a weak fen fades.
The BOJ expects inflation to pick up again as a tight labor market lifts wages.
The central bank is thus in no mood to consider expanding stimulus any time soon, although some analysts warn it may face pressure to act if the economic recovery loses momentum and fails to nudge up prices late this year.
""Exports are weak and household spending - hit by the April sales tax hike - won't bounce back so strongly, which means the economy lacks a strong driver ahead,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
""The economy may not recover as strongly as expected, which will certainly affect price moves,"" he said, predicting that the BOJ may ease policy in April next year if inflation fails to approach 2 percent by then.
The nationwide core consumer price index, which excludes volatile prices of fresh food but includes prices of oil products, rose 3.3 percent in June from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, matching a median market forecast and slowing from a 3.4 percent gain in May.
Excluding the impact of a sales tax hike implemented in April, core consumer inflation slowed to 1.3 percent in the year to June from 1.4 percent in May, largely because rises in energy costs moderated from last year's sharp increases.
The government shared the BOJ's view that prices are rising moderately in its annual economic ""white paper"" on Friday, though it kept up pressure on the central bank to maintain its massive stimulus for some time as inflation remains well below its 2 percent target.
""The government has not officially declared an end to deflation, so I think that it is too early to debate about an exit strategy (from the easy policy),"" Economics Minister Akira Amari told reporters after the release of the CPI data.
In one positive sign, core-core prices, which exclude both fresh food and energy, actually accelerated slightly, offering a hint of inflationary pressure in the economy.
The data showed prices rose for nearly 90 percent of components making up core CPI, including television sets and personal computers, suggesting that companies feel more comfortable raising prices with household spending holding up for now.
""There are signs the current slowdown in inflation will bottom out in the first half of next fiscal year,"" said Shuji Tonouchi, senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
""The BOJ can still argue that prices are on track and that inflation will accelerate again.""
Core-core CPI, which is similar to core consumer prices in the United States, rose 2.3 percent in the year to June, more than a 2.2 percent annual rise in the previous month.
OUTLOOK MURKY
The BOJ has stressed that Japan is on track to meet its 2 percent inflation target as improvements in the economy allow more firms to raise prices and boost wages.
""The conquest of deflation in Japan is now in sight,"" BOJ Deputy Governor Hiroshi Nakaso said on Wednesday, signaling his confidence for a sustained recovery.
But many analysts still doubt whether inflation will accelerate as quickly as the BOJ projects, given that the boost to prices from the weak yen is fading.
All of the economists polled in a Reuters poll forecast the BOJ would miss its 2 percent inflation target, but expectations that the central bank would ease this year are receding given its optimism Japan is emerging from deflation.
The economic growth projection of private-sector analysts, at 0.7 percent for the current fiscal year through March, is also more bearish than the BOJ's 1.0 percent forecast.
While the BOJ is set to maintain its scenario of a moderate recovery ahead, an unexpected fall in May machinery orders and a slump in exports in June exports cloud the outlook for the world's third-largest economy.

The BOJ argues that tighter labor markets will nudge up wages and support prices, but it is uncertain whether companies will raise wages enough to make up for the loss of household spending power from the tax hike and inflation.
The BOJ has estimated that the sales tax hike - to 8 percent from 5 percent on April 1 - would add 1.7 percentage points to annual consumer inflation in April, and 2.0 points from the following month. The internal affairs ministry does not provide official estimates.
The BOJ has stood pat on monetary policy since deploying an intense burst of stimulus in April last year, when it pledged to double base money via aggressive asset purchases to accelerate inflation in two years and end Japan's decades of deflation.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2014 01:55PM ET</span>","U.S. jobless claims hit more than eight-year low, but home sales tumble","By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in nearly 8-1/2 years last week, suggesting the labor market recovery was gaining traction. 
While another report on Thursday showed a sharp decline in new homes sales in June, economists cautioned against reading too much into the drop, noting that other data have pointed to housing getting back on track after stalling in late 2013. 
""The economy is doing better,"" said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""You really cannot put too much (stock) in the ups and downs in new home sales. I don't think it suggests that housing is heading south."" 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 284,000 for the week ended July 19, the lowest level since February 2006, the Labor Department said. Economists had expected claims to rise to 308,000. 
Though claims are volatile around this time of the month because of summer auto plant shutdowns for retooling, the data provided further evidence that the labor market was tightening. Employment growth has topped 200,000 jobs in each of the last five months, a stretch not seen since the late 1990s. 
""This is consistent with another solid payroll reading for July,"" said Sam Bullard, senior economist with Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said new home sales dropped 8.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 406,000 units in June. It was the biggest decline since July of last year. 
At the same time, May's sales pace was revised to 442,000 units from the previously reported 504,000 units - the largest downward revision on record. 
New home sales, however, are volatile and the decline is at odds with other data this week that showed existing home sales, which represent the lion's share of the market, at an eight-month high in June. 
Still, the data and a 23 percent slump in third-quarter profit reported by D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI), the number one U.S. homebuilder, weighed on housing stocks. The PHLX housing sector index (HGX:) was down more than 2.7 percent in early afternoon trading, while the broad S&P 500 index was flat. 
FED WATCHING LABOR MARKET 
Economists said the Federal Reserve would look at the claims data favorably as it considers when to raise interest rates. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen cautioned last week that the U.S. central bank could raise rates sooner and more rapidly than currently envisioned if the labor market continued to improve faster than anticipated by policymakers. 
Economists currently do not expect the U.S. central bank to start raising interest rates before the second half of 2015. The Fed, which is wrapping up its monthly bond buying program, has kept overnight lending rates near zero since December 2008. 
In its report, the Labor Department said the four-week average of claims, considered a better gauge of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell to the lowest level since May 2007. 
The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week hit the lowest level since June 2007 in the week ended July 12. 

The so-called continuing claims data covered the week of the household survey from which the unemployment rate is calculated, and suggested the jobless rate could decline from near a six-year low of 6.1 percent.

In a report, market research group Markit said that its preliminary U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers’ index dipped to a seasonally adjusted 56.3 this month from a final reading of 57.3 in June. Analysts had expected the index to ease up to 57.5 in July.
Nonetheless, the output index reading in July (60.4) was well above the 50.0 no-change mark and still pointed to an historically strong rate of growth.
On the index, a reading above 50.0 indicates industry expansion, below indicates contraction.
Commenting on the report, Chris Williamson, Chief Economist at Markit said that “The data suggest the sector is growing at an annualized rate of roughly 8% as we moved into the second half of the year.”

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2014 10:20PM ET</span>",China July HSBC flash PMI at 18-month high ,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in 18 months in July as new orders surged, a preliminary HSBC survey showed on Thursday, the latest indication that the economy is picking up as government stimulus measures kick in.
The HSBC/Markit Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 52.0 in July from June's final reading of 50.7, beating a forecast of 51.0 in a Reuters poll.
It was the highest reading since January 2013, and above the 50-point level that separates growth in activity from contraction for the second consecutive month.
""Economic activity continues to improve in July, suggesting that the cumulative impact of mini-stimulus measures introduced earlier is still filtering through,"" said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC.
""We expect policy makers to maintain their accommodative stance over the next few months to consolidate the recovery.""
Mainland China stocks jumped after the PMI report while shares in the rest of Asia edged higher. The Australian dollar hit a three-week high on prospects of stronger exports to China.
A breakdown of the survey showed most of 11 sub-indices that measure output, domestic and foreign demand improved substantially from June.
A sub-index measuring new orders, a gauge of demand at home and abroad, hit a 18-month high of 53.7, while the sub-index for output also rose to a 16-month high in June.
The employment index also improved from May, though it was still a shade under 50, which implies that jobs are still being lost in the manufacturing sector.
Any marked weakening in the labor market would raise alarm bells for China's government, which regards healthy employment levels as a top policy priority and an important condition for social stability.
Premier Li Keqiang said last week that economic growth of slightly more or less than 7.5 percent this year would be acceptable as long it still led to new jobs and higher wages.
China's economy grew slightly faster than expected in the second quarter as the burst of official stimulus paid dividends, but some analysts say the recovery appears largely dependent on government assistance.
Economists believe Beijing will likely need to offer further support to meet its growth target of around 7.5 percent for the full year, particularly if the already cooling property market begins to deteriorate more sharply.
Since April, China has steadily loosened policy by reducing the amount of cash that some banks have to hold as reserves, instructing regional governments to quicken their spending, and hastening the construction of railways and public housing.

1481,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 23, 2014 07:15PM ET</span>",Goldilocks Would Like The Latest Inflation Report: Econ Data Is Just Right,"By Meagan Clark - For American workers, the latest economic data was just right: The U.S. economy appears safe from the threat of an unruly spike in prices or a precipitous end to the relief doled out by the Federal Reserve.
That was the takeaway as economists sifted through data released by the government on Tuesday, most prominently an inflation report that showed prices for goods and services climbing by 1.9 percent in June, a slight easing from the 2 percent increase seen a month earlier.
While consumers may be forgiven for assuming that no rise in prices is a good thing, economists have been looking for inflation to come in right around the 2 percent level. A significantly faster rise in prices could prompt the Fed to hike interest rates and dampen economic growth in a bid to to limit further price hikes -- a step that would almost certainly eliminate jobs and exacerbate unemployment.
On the other hand, a sharper dip in inflation might have amplified worries that American companies are suffering weak demand for their goods and services, forcing them to cut the price of their wares to coax buyers into the market. This, too, would tend to hurt employment as American companies lowered production targets.  
Instead, the data came in at a level that would please Goldilocks: neither too hot nor too cold, but suggesting a modest and sustainable pace of economic expansion that should see continued growth in working opportunities.
“As long as inflation remains weak, that should boost purchasing power and fuel growth and job creation,” said Aneta Markowska, chief U.S. economist for French bank Societe Generale in New York. “But right now we are looking at inflation that’s growing in line with hourly wages. People are earning enough to keep up with inflation but not necessarily beyond that.”
Most economists concurred, pronouncing the pace of inflation fast enough to indicate overall economic growth but not rapid enough to discourage buyers.  
“That’s nothing to worry about,” said Paul Dales, senior U.S. economist for London-based Capital Economics. “It will probably rise a bit, but not much.”
The Fed has indicated that it hopes to see inflation -- the increase in price levels of goods and services -- to be at least 2 percent but not much higher to keep unemployment from rising above its current 6.1 percent. (Seven years ago in the run-up the Great Recession, unemployment sat below 5 percent while prices were rising at a barely detectable 0.1 percent annualized rate.)
French bank Societe Generale forecasts a rebound in U.S. consumer prices, pushing up the consumer price index (CPI) -- a monthly measure used by economists to track changes in the price levels of products households commonly buy -- by about 2.3 percent by the end of the year.
In June, core consumer prices, which exclude energy and food prices, increased 0.1 percent, the smallest gain in fourth months.
Although prices for meat, milk, gasoline and other things most Americans buy regularly rose, prices of home goods like washing machines, furniture, dishes and lamps have fallen by 1.5 percent in the past year, the quickest pace since the recession’s nadir in 2009.

Prices for so-called durable goods have fallen since a peak in 1997 and are now at 1988 levels, assuming today’s prices reflect the improved quality of the products. That means almost every household durable good, from curtains to TVs, is cheaper to buy today than 17 years ago.
“I think it’s got a lot to do with technology,” Dales said. “When the first person designed a plasma TV, it was cutting edge and the processes weren’t very efficient… Over time as these items become more popular, the cost of producing them decreases.”
“It’s also the case that a lot of the production has been shifted to lower cost countries,” he added. “If you were going to manufacture a TV in the U.S., costs would be higher than in India or parts of China.”
The falling prices are not just an effect of weak demand after the recession trimmed families’ budgets. Sluggish economic growth in China has also dragged down prices of imports like household items and clothing, as Chinese factories have had excess capacity and supply that lowered wages and prices there, Markowska said. “That slowdown [in China] has pretty much run its course,” she said. “Things appear to be stabilizing or picking up a bit.”
Meanwhile, rising aluminum prices and growing rent and home sales could increase demand and prices for household goods, experts suggested. Aluminum prices are set to rise with demand as producers refrain from adding capacity, and a seven-year slowdown in the housing market has left room for a resurgence in home construction.
Existing home sales increased 2.6 percent in June, reaching 5 million sales for the first time since October, the National Association of Realtors reported Tuesday. June’s new home sales data will come from the Commerce Department on Thursday. In May, sales of new homes increased by 18.6 percent, the highest rise since October.
The rebound in home sales and manufacturing, in turn, seem to promise higher economic growth for the rest of the year, which would offset a decline in shopping caused by the unexpectedly cold weather at the beginning of this year. Global research firm IHS forecasts that U.S. growth will end the year at 1.7 percent but rise to 3 percent by the end of 2015. On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund revised its forecast for U.S. economic growth to “a disappointing 1.7 percent” -- but like IHS, it projects 3 percent growth for 2015.

1484,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 23, 2014 05:04PM ET</span>",Reserve Bank of New Zealand hikes OCR to 3.5% as expected,"Investing.com - The following is the full text statement from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand after lifting the Offical Cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.5% as expected on Thursday.
Statement issued by Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler:
The Reserve Bank today increased the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent.
New Zealand’s economy is expected to grow at an annual pace of 3.7 percent over 2014. Global financial conditions remain very accommodative and are reflected in low interest rates, narrow risk spreads, and low financial market volatility. Economic growth among New Zealand’s trading partners has eased slightly in the first half of 2014, but this appears to be due to temporary factors.
Construction, particularly in Canterbury, is growing strongly. At the same time, strong net immigration is adding to housing and household demand, although house price inflation has moderated further since the June Statement.
Over recent months, export prices for dairy and timber have fallen, and these will reduce primary sector incomes over the coming year. With the exchange rate yet to adjust to weakening commodity prices, the level of the New Zealand dollar is unjustified and unsustainable and there is potential for a significant fall.
Inflation remains moderate, but strong growth in output has been absorbing spare capacity. This is expected to add to non-tradables inflation. Wage inflation is subdued, reflecting recent low inflation outcomes, increased labour force participation, and strong net immigration.
It is important that inflation expectations remain contained. Today’s move will help keep future average inflation near the 2 percent target mid-point and ensure that the economic expansion can be sustained. Encouragingly, the economy appears to be adjusting to the monetary policy tightening that has taken place since the start of the year. It is prudent that there now be a period of assessment before interest rates adjust further towards a more-neutral level.
The speed and extent to which the OCR will need to rise will depend on the assessment of the impact of the tightening in monetary policy to date, and the implications of future economic and financial data for inflationary pressures.

1501,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 22, 2014 02:45PM ET</span>",June US Food Prices Rose At Slowest Pace Since January,"By Meagan Clark - U.S. food prices rose in June though at the slowest pace since January, indicating the effects of a cold winter and droughts across the Southwest may be subsiding.
Federal data released Tuesday indicate food prices rose 0.1 percent in June from May, compared to a 0.5 percent increase the previous month.
Still, prices of some items like pork chops and milk are much higher than a year ago and are outpacing inflation. Pork chop prices rose 14 percent from last year, primarily due to a virus called porcine epidemic diarrhea virus killing piglets across the country. Whole milk prices are up 6 percent from last year. Fish, beef, cheese, butter and eggs are all up more than 7 percent from a year ago. Fresh fruits, many grown in drought-plagued California, are up nearly 6 percent from a year ago, led by a 12 percent increase in citrus fruit prices. 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, taking into account the droughts in the Southwest and the stress on cattle from cold weather last winter, predicts food prices will rise by 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent this year, after a 1.4 percent rise last year. Internationally, food prices rose about 4 percent in spring, ending a two-year decline, the World Bank reported.
The annual core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, declined to 1.9 percent in June from the Federal Reserve’s targeted 2 percent.

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary July reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment came in at 81.3, below both the consensus analyst expectation of 83 and the final June read of 82.5.
""The most remarkable aspect of recent trends in consumer confidence has been its resistance to change in either direction due to very negative GDP nor very positive employment gains,"" survey director Richard Curtin said in a statement.
""This stability will provide the necessary strength for consumer spending to continue to expand, but does not support an acceleration in spending above 2.5 percent.""
The survey's barometer of current economic conditions rose to 97.1 from 96.6, compared with a forecast of 97.0.
The survey's gauge of consumer expectations slipped for a third straight month, to 71.1 from 73.5. The subindex was below an expected 74.0.
The survey's one-year inflation expectation rose to 3.3 percent from 3.1 percent in June, while the survey's five-to-10-year inflation outlook fell to 2.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
Curtin said long-term inflation expectations had only been lower once in the past 25 years, in 2009, when expectations were for 2.5 percent.

""Indeed, 2.6 percent was only recorded twice before at the depth of the Great Recession,"" he said. ""While at the bottom of the range it has traveled in the past decade, it gave no indication of a trend toward deflation.""

Groundbreaking declined 9.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 893,000 million unit-pace, the lowest since September, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. April's starts were revised to show a steeper 7.3 percent fall instead of the previously reported 6.5 percent drop.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast starts rising to a 1.02 million-unit rate last month.
Housing has been constrained by higher mortgage rates. A shortage of properties for sale has pushed up prices, reducing affordability for many.
But there are glimmers of hope for the sector. A survey on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family home builders hit a six-month high in July, amid optimism over sales over the next six months.
Groundbreaking for single-family homes, the largest part of the market, tumbled 9.0 percent in June to a 575,000-unit pace, the lowest since November 2012. Single-family starts in the South dropped to their lowest level in two years.
Starts for the volatile multi-family homes segment dropped 9.9 percent to a 318,000-unit rate.

Permits fell 4.2 percent to a 963,000-unit pace in June.
Economists had expected them to rise to a 1.04-million unit pace. With permits now leading starts, groundbreaking could pick up in the months ahead.
Permits for single-family homes increased 2.6 percent to a 631,000 unit-pace, the highest level since November. Permits for multi-family housing tumbled 14.9 percent to a 332,000-unit pace.

Consumer prices in the 18 countries using the euro rose 0.1 percent on the month in June for a 0.5 percent year-on-year gain -- the same annual inflation rate as in May, data from the European Union's statistics office Eurostat showed.
The annual rate is well below the ECB's inflation target of close to, but below 2 percent. The central bank believes that price growth slower than 1 percent is a ""danger zone"" because of the risk of deflation. Price growth has been below 1 percent since last in October.
The ECB left interest rates unchanged in July, a month after cutting them to record lows and pushing the deposit rate into negative territory and it made clear it was ready to print money in the future if needed to prevent deflation.

Consumer prices fell in Greece, Portugal and Slovakia in June and 5 countries had inflation at or above 1 percent, including Germany where prices rose 1.0 percent on the year.
Core annual inflation - which excludes the volatile prices of energy and unprocessed food - stood at 0.8 percent in June, unchanged from May.
The ECB is also keeping an eye on the euro exchange rate and its impact on inflation -- the bank is ready to launch additional measures to prevent deflation if the euro becomes to strong.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2014 12:30AM ET</span>",U.S. foreclosure activity hits lowest level since 2006: RealtyTrac,"By Elvina Nawaguna WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Foreclosure activity in the United States dropped last month to the lowest level since July 2006, before the housing bubble burst, and likely will continue to drop through the first half of next year, an industry group said on Thursday.
RealtyTrac, which tracks housing market trends, said that 107,194 properties across the country were at some stage of the foreclosure process in June. That marked a 2 percent decline from May and left foreclosure activity, which includes foreclosure notices, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions, 16 percent below the year-ago level.
""Over the next six to nine months, nationwide foreclosure numbers should start to flatline at consistently historically normal levels,"" RealtyTrac vice president Daren Blomquist said in a statement.
June was the 45th consecutive month foreclosure activity was down on an annual basis.
Declining foreclosures have reduced the supply of properties on the market, pushing home prices up. That, combined with higher mortgage rates, has slowed the recovery of the U.S. housing market.
Lenders reclaimed a total of 26,889 properties in June, down 5 percent from May and the lowest level since June 2007. Repossessions were down 24 percent from a year ago.
Nationwide, 46,743 properties were set for foreclosure auctions, a 13 percent decrease from the last year, bringing scheduled foreclosure auctions to the lowest level since July 2006.
Lenders started the foreclosure process on 47,243 properties in June, down 18 percent from a year ago, and the lowest level since November 2005.
Florida continued to have the nation's highest foreclosure rate, followed by Illinois, New Jersey and Nevada.
The RealtyTrac report also included data for the first half of the year, which showed foreclosure activity decreased in 79 percent of the 212 metropolitan areas during the first half of 2014.
Foreclosure activity for the first six months of the year was down 23 percent from the same period in 2013.

""While it's important that any remaining foreclosure infection is addressed promptly to keep it from festering, foreclosures are no longer a widespread contagion threatening to derail the housing market's return to full health,"" Blomquist said.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 16, 2014 08:40AM ET</span>","U.S. factory output surges in second quarter, housing improving","
By Lucia Mutikani 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing output rose at its fastest pace in more than two years in the second quarter, suggesting the economy was regaining enough momentum to lift growth throughout the year. 
Other data on Wednesday showed inflation stirring at the factory gate and the housing market getting back on track after its recovery stalled late last year. 
Factory production increased at a 6.7 percent annual rate, the quickest pace since the first quarter of 2012, the Federal Reserve said. That was an acceleration from the January-March period's tepid 1.4 percent pace. 
Manufacturing output, however, increased only 0.1 percent in June after a 0.4 percent gain the prior month. 
But the strong performance in the second quarter coupled with a report on Tuesday that showed a surge in factory activity in New York state left economists confident the sector was on solid ground and would continue to support the overall economy. 
""The backdrop for the manufacturing sector is favorable at the start of the third quarter,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina, who added that the manufacturing sector would continue to drive economic growth in the second half of the year. 
The sturdy manufacturing growth helped to lift overall industrial production to a 5.5 percent pace in the second quarter, the fastest since the third quarter of 2010. 
The economy contracted sharply in the first quarter. It has since rebounded, with growth estimates for the April-June quarter topping a 3.0 percent annual rate. 
Separately, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book found economic activity continued to expand in recent weeks, with manufacturing and consumer spending gaining traction. 
A second report on Wednesday showed the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index rose to 53 this month, the highest level in six months, from 49 in June. A reading above 50 means more builders view market conditions as favorable. 
Builders were upbeat about sales over the next six months and optimistic about prospective buyer traffic. That is welcome news for a sector that has been stymied by higher mortgage rates, expensive homes and a dearth of properties for sale. 
The upbeat data helped to lift U.S. stocks, with the Dow Jones industrial average surging to a fresh intraday high. The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while prices for shorter-dated U.S. Treasuries slipped. 
INFLATION TRENDING UP 
Another report from the Labor Department hinted at some pick-up of inflation at the factory gate. The department said its producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month, reversing May's 0.2 percent decline. 
The series has been too volatile to offer a clear read on producer inflation since being revamped at the start of the year to include services and construction. 
Still, inflation is edging higher. Key consumer price measures rose in both May and April, even though the main gauge watched by the Federal Reserve continues to run below its 2 percent target. 
""We think the odds are growing that this inflation target could be exceeded by the end of this year and we still look to March 2015 as the date of the first rate hike,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The U.S. central bank is widely expected to start raising interest rates in the second half of 2015, but labor market strength poses the risk of an earlier policy tightening. 
Fed Chair Janet Yellen cautioned on Tuesday that the central bank could raise interest rates sooner and more rapidly than currently envisioned if the labor market continued to improve faster than anticipated by policymakers. 
The Fed, which is moving toward wrapping up its monthly bond buying program, has kept overnight lending rates near zero since December 2008. In the 12 months through June, producer prices increased 1.9 percent after rising 2.0 percent in May. 

Producer prices excluding food and energy gained 0.2 percent in June after slipping 0.1 percent in May. In the 12 months through June, the core PPI for final demand rose 1.8 percent after increasing 2.0 percent in the period through May.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2014 10:20PM ET</span>","China growth picks up as stimulus kicks in, more support may be needed","
By Xiaoyi Shao and Kevin Yao 
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic growth picked up slightly in the second quarter as a burst of government stimulus paid dividends, but analysts said Beijing will likely need to offer more support to meet its annual growth target as the property market slows. 
Analysts remain cautious about the economic outlook, noting that the pick-up in growth was driven more by government support than a natural recovery in momentum, as evidenced by a surprising surge in lending by state-controlled banks in June. 
Many believe the slowing property sector poses the biggest risk to the economy in the second half of the year, and thus could dictate whether Beijing sticks to a steady rollout of modest stimulus steps or considers more aggressive action such as interest rate cuts. 
""The recovery is quite dependent on government support. So I think the government can choose either to tolerate lower growth or to do more stimulus to achieve their growth target,"" said Chang Jian, an analyst at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong. 
""The biggest risk (to the economy) for the second half is a property correction and related financial risks,"" she said. 
The economy grew 7.5 percent in April-June from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said on Wednesday, just ahead of a median forecast of 7.4 percent in a Reuters poll. 
A raft of support measures helped lift the pace from an 18-month low of 7.4 percent in the first quarter, with infrastructure investment and related manufacturing offsetting the drag from weak exports and the cooling property market. 
Stimulus measures have included sharply higher bank lending, reducing the amount of cash some banks have to hold as reserves, instructing regional governments to quicken their spending and hastening the construction of railways and public housing. 
Though officials continue to describe such steps as ""fine-tuning"", Beijing has been steadily broadening the scope and depth of its assistance, as indicated by the June lending surge and reported moves by local governments to ease home buying restrictions. 
PROPERTY WEIGHS 
The property sector continues to drag on growth, even though Reuters calculations showed home sales by value picked up sharply in June as state-controlled banks made credit more easily available. 
A senior central bank official was quoted as saying this week that Chinese banks increased their lending to the property sector by 18 percent in the first six months of 2014 compared with the year-ago period, in what he said is a ""forceful"" show of support. 
In spite of such moves, however, growth in China's real estate investment slowed in the first half of 2014 while sales and new construction slipped. 
Real estate investment, which affects more than 40 other sectors, rose 14.1 percent in the first half of 2014 from the same period a year ago, down from an annual rise of 14.7 percent in the first five months, official data showed on Wednesday. 
Peng Wensheng, chief economist at CICC, estimated that the slowdown in property investment could cut China's 2014 economic growth by about 1 percentage point, based on his estimates that the property sector makes up for 20 percent of GDP. 
Property investment growth could slow to 14 percent this year from nearly 20 percent in 2013, Peng said in a note. 
New property construction fell 16.4 percent in the first six months from a year earlier, while property sales in terms of floor space dropped 6 percent, threatening not only a loss of jobs but lower sales of home and building materials from cement to copper pipes and furniture. 
""China will remain at a tipping point between a growth recovery driven by government stimulus on one hand and a major drag on the economy coming from real estate,"" Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong, said in a note ahead of the GDP data release. 
""The jury will remain out regarding which factor will end up winning."" 
Top leaders have ruled out any massive stimulus as China struggles to deal with piles of local government debt, the hangover from a 4 trillion yuan ($644 billion) spending package implemented in 2008-09 to help cushion the country from the global financial crisis. 
SERIOUS ABOUT TARGET 
The unexpectedly hefty increase in bank loans in June had been taken as a signal of Beijing's alarm at the slowdown, and how far it is prepared to go to get growth back on track. 
Premier Li Keqiang vowed recently that the economy would grow by at least 7.5 percent in 2014, surprising many market watchers after a weak start to the year and reinforcing expectations of more government assistance to come. 
""We believe Beijing is quite serious about its 7.5 percent 
growth target as it needs a stable economic and financial backdrop as it steps up its anti-corruption campaign,"" said Ting Lu, China economist at Bank of America-Marrill Lynch in Hong Kong. 
""So we think the new government will most likely continue 
its mini-stimulus,"" he said in a note. 

Lu expected the government to stick with modest policy steps, refraining from bolder steps such as cutting interest rates or reserve requirement for all banks, while Barclays' Chang expected the central bank to cut rates in the third and fourth quarters.

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday inventories increased 0.5 percent after rising 0.6 percent in April.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast inventories, which are a key component of gross domestic product changes, rising 0.6 percent in May. Retail inventories, excluding autos, which go into the calculation of GDP, edged up 0.1 percent after a similar gain in April.
A sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation helped to weigh down on the economy, which contracted at a 2.9 percent annual pace in the first quarter.
Inventories subtracted 1.7 percentage points from GDP and a swing in restocking is expected to raise growth above a 3.0 percent pace in the second quarter.
Data already released has shown a steady increase in wholesale inventories and a jump in stocks at manufacturers.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2014 08:40AM ET</span>",U.S. retail sales rise modestly on surprise automobiles decline,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased less than expected in June as receipts at automobiles dealerships surprisingly fell, but details of Tuesday's report suggested the economy was on a solid footing at the end of the second quarter.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.2 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent advance in May.
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which account for a third of consumer spending, rising 0.6 percent after a previously reported 0.3 percent gain in May.
So-called core sales, which strip out automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, and correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, increased a solid 0.6 percent in June.
Core sales rose by a revised 0.2 percent in May. They were previously reported as being flat and economists had expected them to rise 0.5 percent in June.
Despite the below-expectations rise in overall sales, June's retail sales report was the latest sign of the economy's strengthening fundamentals, which could buoy optimism the recovery is on a self-sustaining path.
The economy contracted sharply in the first quarter, but that was probably just a temporary setback.
From employment to manufacturing, the economy appears to be firing on nearly all cylinders with even housing appearing to be regaining its footing after slumping in late 2013 following a run-up in mortgage rates. Growth estimates for the second-quarter top a 3.0 percent annual rate.
Overall retail sales last month were held back by a 0.3 percent fall in receipts at auto dealerships. The decline is surprising given that automakers reported a surge in motor vehicle sales in June. Auto sales had increased 0.8 percent in May.
Excluding autos, sales increased 0.4 percent after rising by the same margin in May.
Sales at non-store retailers, which include online sales, increased 0.9 percent. Receipts at gasoline stations gained 0.3 percent, and sales at clothing retailers advanced 0.8 percent.
Receipts at sporting goods shops rose 0.6 percent and sales at electronics and appliances stores gained 0.1 percent.

But sales at building materials and garden equipment suppliers fell 1.0 percent.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2014 01:10AM ET</span>",China June bank loans beat expectations as Beijing steps on the gas,"By Aileen Wang and Kevin Yao BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing stepped up efforts to re-energise China's economy in June and avert a sharper slowdown, pumping more money into the system and pressing banks to extend more loans, but analysts say more stimulus will be needed to ensure a sustained recovery.
Data over the last week offered some signs that the world's second-largest economy steadied in the second quarter as a raft of government stimulus measures kicked in, though exports remained sluggish, putting greater pressure on Beijing to stoke domestic demand.
A cooling property market also points to continued risks in the second half and could well determine the scope and extent of further policy easing, after Premier Li Keqiang vowed recently that the economy would grow by at least the targeted 7.5 percent rate this year.
Chinese banks, which are used by Beijing as a policy tool, made a much stronger-than expected 1.08 trillion yuan ($173.9 billion) of new yuan loans in June, nearly 20 percent more than market expectations, data on Tuesday showed.
Broad M2 money supply jumped 14.7 percent last month from a year earlier - the highest in 10 months, the People's Bank of China said in a statement on its website, also higher than a forecast of 13.5 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.
""While a fall in short-term lending rates hinted at a higher supply of funds during the month, the money swirling in the market reflects the urgency of the authorities to ramp up economic activity,"" said Chester Liaw, an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore.
Outstanding yuan loans grew 14 percent from a year ago, slightly better than expectations, while the total social financing aggregate, a broad measure of liquidity in the economy, swelled to 1.97 trillion yuan in June from 1.4 trillion yuan the month before.
""We had previously expected aggregate financing to come in much higher, but still the 1.97 trillion yuan printed as a major upside surprise,"" Liaw said.
The central bank has pledged to keep credit and money supply growth at a reasonable level to meet the needs of the real economy. It aims for a 13 percent annual rise in M2 this year.
The strong growth in money supply in June ""is an explicit loosening of (monetary) conditions. Some of this is seasonal. At the end of the quarter there was demand for cash. And evidently, the authorities supplied it,"" said Tim Condon, economist at ING Bank in Singapore.
But other economists were more cautious.
""We believe that June's rebound in credit growth has more to do with a weak base for comparison due to the cash crunch last year than with the current policy stance,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.
UPBEAT ON EXPORT OUTLOOK
After a shaky start to the year, China's economy has recently shown signs of turning the corner thanks to a series of government stimulus measures, including reserve requirement cuts for some banks and more spending on railways and public housing.
Government spending surged 26.1 percent in June from a year earlier to 1.65 trillion yuan, further reflecting Beijing's determination to revive growth momentum.
However, many economists stress that the rebound looks patchy and believe more policy support may still be needed to counter the broader economic downdraft from the slowing property sector.
China's Commerce Ministry said on Tuesday that export growth should show marked improvement in the second-half of the year compared to the first six months, making it likely that China will achieve its 7.5 percent trade growth target for 2014.
""Our surveys on exporters showed that export firms are showing confidence on trade growth. Therefore, we expect both export and import growth will improve remarkably in the second half than that in the first half,"" Shen Danyang, ministry spokesman told reporters at the monthly briefing: ""If stripping off last year's high base effect of abnormal trade growth, I think we are able to achieve the 7.5 percent annual trade growth target in 2014 through efforts.""
China's trade performance improved in June but still missed market forecasts, while cooler-than-expect inflation readings pointed to lingering sluggishness in the economy.
China's foreign direct investment inflows rose at an annual pace of 2.2 percent in the first six months and were up only modestly for June, reflecting investors' cautiousness over the economic outlook.
The government is due to release second-quarter GDP growth on Wednesday, along with data on fixed-asset investment for the first half and factory output and retail sales for June.
Economists polled by Reuters expected annual GDP growth of 7.4 percent in the second quarter, matching the 18-month low in the first quarter, though Premier Li said last week that growth had improved in April-June.

Members Present

Members granted leave of absence to Roger Corbett AO in terms of section 18A of the Reserve Bank Act 1959.Others Present

International Economic Conditions
Members opened their discussion of the world economy by noting that the available data for the June quarter had been consistent with Australia's major trading partners continuing to grow at around the average pace of the past decade.
In China, indicators of economic growth had generally been holding steady of late, although growth overall still appeared to have been somewhat slower than in the previous year. Over recent months, growth of retail sales and industrial production had been steady while the more timely PMIs had picked up. Growth in real estate investment had declined recently, consistent with softer conditions in the property market, whereas growth in infrastructure investment had increased somewhat. The authorities had eased reserve requirements a little for banks that lend mainly to the rural sector and small businesses.
Prices for steel in China, and the spot price of iron ore, were little changed over June, although the price of iron ore was about 30 per cent lower than earlier in 2014, reflecting increases in supply as well as a softening in the growth of demand for Chinese steel. Members observed that most mines in Australia (and Brazil) producing iron ore for export to China had lower variable costs of production than mines in China and other countries. Overall, other commodity prices were also little changed over the past month, but had fallen significantly since the start of the year.
Economic activity in Japan fell sharply in April, as had been expected given the sizeable run-up in spending ahead of the consumption tax increase in early April. Since then, there had been a pick-up in a number of indicators of activity. The rate of core inflation fell back in May after a large increase in April owing to the rise in the consumption tax rate. Members noted that while much of the higher rate of inflation over the past year had resulted from the depreciation of the yen, indicators pointed to demand growth running ahead of the growth of productive capacity and some tightening in the labour market. In the rest of east Asia, recent indicators were consistent with a slight pick-up in the pace of growth in the June quarter. Growth remained relatively subdued in India.
Recent data suggested that the US economy had grown at a moderate pace over recent months, after contracting in the first quarter. The labour market had strengthened further, with payrolls rising strongly in May and the unemployment rate noticeably lower than it had been earlier in the year. There were also some signs that consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat over recent months, although growth of wages had remained relatively modest.
Economic activity in the euro area appeared to have continued to expand at a modest pace in the June quarter. The unemployment rate had recorded a slight decline since the start of the year, but unemployment remained high and inflation continued to be well below the 2 per cent target.
Domestic Economic Conditions
The national accounts data showed that the economy grew at an above-average pace in the March quarter, driven by very strong growth in resource exports. GDP increased by 1.1 per cent in the quarter and by 3.5 per cent over the year. With the sharp rise in resource exports reflecting capacity expansions and unseasonably favourable weather conditions, resource exports were not expected to grow as quickly in coming quarters. Excluding resource exports, GDP growth had still picked up but was less than 2 per cent over the year. Mining investment had declined noticeably to be around 15 per cent below its peak in late 2012, and further substantial falls were anticipated over coming quarters. Growth in public demand was weak and was expected to remain so over the next couple of years, in line with planned fiscal consolidation by federal and state governments.
Labour market conditions had improved a little since late in the preceding year. The level of employment was around 0.9 per cent higher since then. The unemployment rate had been steady at 5.8 per cent for the third consecutive month, although the participation rate had declined over that period. Employment growth in household services continued to be strong over the past six months, while employment in business services had also picked up. Members observed, however, that total hours worked had not increased for a considerable time. Forward-looking indicators of employment had recently been mixed and while these indicators were higher than at the low points of the previous year, they remained at levels consistent with only moderate growth in employment in the months ahead.
The recent national accounts data indicated that unit labour costs were little changed over the past year, reflecting low growth of wages and above-average growth of productivity. Members noted that while labour productivity had been boosted by a sharp improvement in the mining sector, productivity growth had improved across a wide range of industries in recent years. Business surveys and liaison suggested that wage growth was likely to remain subdued for some time, consistent with the modest improvement in the labour market to date.
There was a sharp fall in mining investment in the March quarter, while non-mining business investment increased a little. The high level of non-residential construction work yet to be done would support growth over the coming quarters, but non-residential building approvals had declined in recent months. Measures of business sentiment remained at around average levels, with the federal budget having had little discernible effect. Growth in intermediated business finance had increased somewhat over the past few quarters.
Household consumption growth had been a little slower in the March quarter than had been suggested by the retail sales data. In April, retail sales values were reported to have increased slightly and the Bank's liaison contacts indicated that retail sales were little changed over the May to June period. After falling sharply in May around the time of the federal budget, measures of consumer sentiment stabilised at below-average levels in June.
Dwelling investment increased noticeably in the March quarter and, over the six months to March, was running at close to the fastest pace seen in around a decade. Residential building approvals had declined somewhat in recent months, but they remained at relatively high levels and both work yet to be done and loan approvals for new dwellings pointed to further strong growth in dwelling investment in coming quarters. At the same time, there had been signs of a tempering in conditions in the established housing market. Members observed that, looking through the monthly volatility, housing price inflation had slowed over recent months, auction clearance rates had fallen from the high levels seen late last year, and loan approvals had been little changed over the past six months.
Financial Markets
Members began their discussion of financial markets with the observation that markets continued to be characterised by low volatility. The main news over the past month had been the announcement by the European Central Bank (ECB) of a widely anticipated package of stimulatory policy measures that sought to address the risk of a prolonged period of low inflation in the euro area. The package comprised three main elements:
* - a reduction of 10 basis points in the ECB's main policy rate to 0.15 per cent, with an equivalent decline in the ECB's deposit rate to −0.10 per cent (which applies to banks' holdings of excess reserves at the ECB)
* - a new program of quarterly targeted long-term refinancing operations to provide low-cost funding to banks for up to four years, with those loan terms conditional on participant banks increasing their lending to the non-financial business sector * - an extension of the ECB's provision of liquidity under fixed-rate full allotment to at least March 2017.
While these measures generally had little impact on financial markets, an exception was the expected path of the ECB's policy rate, which had shifted down further. The policy rate was now expected to remain below 0.50 per cent for more than three years. Members noted that the ECB had indicated that it would continue preparatory work to enable it to undertake outright purchases of asset-backed securities if required. The ECB had also reaffirmed its commitment to further unconventional policy measures – including large-scale, broad-based asset purchases – if the latest measures failed to boost inflation towards the 2 per cent target.
Members contrasted these measures with the actions taken by the US Federal Reserve at its June meeting, when it again reduced its asset purchases by a further US$10 billion to US$35 billion per month, down from a peak of US$85 billion per month in 2013. The Fed remained on track to cease asset purchases later this year, with markets expecting the first increase in the federal funds rate around the middle of next year. Members also noted that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand had raised its policy interest rate for the third time in the current cycle in response to a strengthening economy, while market expectations of the first increase in the Bank of England's policy rate had shifted forward to the end of this year.
In response to generally better-than-expected economic data, government bond yields in the United States had increased a little in June, largely reversing the decline in the previous month. In contrast, yields on German bonds had fallen towards their historic lows during June. Members noted that Japanese purchases of foreign bonds continued to rise in June, with earlier more detailed data showing solid purchases of US and Australian bonds. Yields on Australian government bonds had declined over the past month, while the spread to US government bonds had declined towards 1 per cent, which was around its narrowest level since mid 2007. Borrowing costs for Australian state governments continued to fall to historic lows.
Members observed that government bond yields in a number of emerging markets had not changed much over the past month, although bond yields in Argentina had been volatile following the earlier decision by a US court to force Argentina to honour obligations to ‘holdout’ creditors who continued to hold bonds on which Argentina had defaulted more than a decade earlier. Members also noted that the manner in which these Argentine claims would be resolved over the next few months had the potential to affect future efforts to restructure sovereign debts in other markets.
Prices in the major equity markets were up a little in June, supported by the announcement of the ECB policy measures and slightly stronger data for the US economy. While heightened concerns about the situation in Iraq and Ukraine had weighed on markets, historically low volatility remained a feature of the major equity markets. In contrast, Australian equity prices had underperformed those in other developed markets, with declines in iron ore prices over recent months leading to falls in share prices in the resources sector. Nonetheless, members noted that equity prices in Australia rose by 12½ per cent over the year to the end of June 2014.
Conditions in foreign exchange markets had remained very subdued, with little change in the major exchange rates and volatility declining further to multi-decade lows in the past month. The Australian dollar had appreciated by around 2 per cent over the past month on a trade-weighted basis, which took its appreciation since late January to 8 per cent notwithstanding noticeable declines in bulk commodity prices over the same period. Members noted that other currencies such as the Canadian and New Zealand dollars had experienced similar movements and that the most surprising development was the continued low level of the US dollar, as well as the resilience of the euro.
Members were briefed that the marginal and average cost of wholesale debt of the major banks continued to decline. In turn, this had led to a decline in spreads on term deposit ‘specials’ relative to equivalent term swap rates.
In Australia, market expectations of future cash rates were little changed over the past month and the cash rate was currently expected to remain unchanged for at least the next 12 months.
Members concluded their discussion with a brief review of the large increase in the Reserve Bank's balance sheet over 2013/14, which had been driven by three main factors, namely an increase in exchange settlement balances held by authorised deposit-taking institutions with the Reserve Bank to facilitate faster payments, a rise in deposits held by the Australian Government, and the government grant to the Reserve Bank in May 2014.
Considerations for Monetary Policy
Overall, global economic conditions were little changed over the past month and were consistent with growth in Australia's major trading partners remaining close to the average of the past decade. Commodity prices had also been steady, but were well below levels seen earlier this year, the more so in Australian dollar terms given the appreciation of the exchange rate since then. Financial conditions globally remained very accommodative.
In Australia, GDP growth was above trend in the March quarter and over the past year, reflecting very strong growth in resource exports from new capacity coming on line. Resource exports were expected to continue to expand in coming quarters, but not at such a rapid pace. There had been a gradual improvement in the pace of activity in the non-resource sector and forward-looking indicators suggested that further strong growth in residential construction was in prospect, despite some easing of conditions in the established housing market over recent months. After picking up through last year, household consumption growth appeared to have eased, while non-mining business investment was picking up gradually.
Conditions in the labour market had improved a little since earlier in the year, although forward-looking indicators had been mixed of late and consistent with only moderate growth in employment. The national accounts data confirmed that wage growth had been relatively low, which was consistent with the spare capacity in the labour market.
At its recent meetings, the Board judged that it was prudent to leave the cash rate unchanged. Low interest rates were working to support demand, but members agreed that it was difficult to judge the extent to which this would offset the anticipated substantial decline in mining investment and the effect of planned fiscal consolidation. The exchange rate remained high by historical standards, particularly given the declines in key commodity prices, and was therefore offering less assistance than it otherwise might in achieving balanced growth in the economy.
With growth in resource exports expected to ease back, GDP growth was forecast to be a little below trend over the next year or so, before picking up gradually thereafter. Inflation was expected to remain within the target. Accordingly, with the significant degree of monetary stimulus already in place to support economic activity, the Board judged that, on present indications, the most prudent course was likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.
The Decision
The Board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 2.5 per cent.

In a report, the U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending July 5 declined by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 304,000 from the previous week’s total of 315,000.

In a report, the U.K. Office for National Statistics said the country's goods trade deficit widened to a seasonally adjusted £9.2 billion in May from a deficit of £8.81 billion in April. Economists had expected the goods trade deficit to narrow to £8.75 billion.
Seasonally adjusted, the U.K.'s deficit on trade in goods and services was estimated to have been £2.4 billion in May, compared with £2.1 billion in April.
There was a deficit of £9.2 billion on goods, partly offset by an estimated surplus of £6.8 billion on services.
In May 2014 exports of goods increased by £0.1 billion to £24.1 billion and imports of goods increased by £0.5 billion to £33.3 billion resulting in a widening of the goods deficit by £0.4 billion. The increase in imports of goods was attributed to aircraft.

1622,By Investing.com,"<span>Jul 09, 2014 02:25PM ET</span>",Fed minutes: QE program likely to end in fourth quarter,"Investing.com - The Federal Reserve will likely wind up its monthly bond-buying program in the fourth quarter of this year, likely around October, the minutes of the U.S. central bank's June 17-18 policy meeting revealed.
The Fed is currently buying $35 billion in Treasury and mortgage debt a month to spur recovery, a monetary policy tool known as quantitative easing that aims to stimulate the economy by suppressing long-term interest rates.
The stimulus program aims to entice investors out of safe-haven asset classes like the U.S. dollar and into equities with the hope investing and hiring follow.
The Fed has gradually been trimming the amount of bonds it purchases by $10 billion a month, and by end of this year, the program should close if the Fed continues to taper on its current trajectory.
""While the current asset purchase program is not on a preset course, participants generally agreed that if the economy evolved as they anticipated, the program would likely be completed later this year,"" the minutes read.
""Some committee members had been asked by members of the public whether, if tapering in the pace of purchases continues as expected, the final reduction would come in a single $15 billion per month reduction or in a $10 billion reduction followed by a $5 billion reduction.""
Expect that final cut to come in October if recovery continues at its current pace.
""Participants generally agreed that if incoming information continued to support its expectation of improvement in labor market conditions and a return of inflation toward its longer-run objective, it would be appropriate to complete asset purchases with a $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases in order to avoid having the small, remaining level of purchases receive undue focus among investors,"" the minutes read.
""If the economy progresses about as the Committee expects, warranting reductions in the pace of purchases at each upcoming meeting, this final reduction would occur following the October meeting.""
Elsewhere, the minutes revealed that monetary authorities were concerned with excessive risk-taking in the country financial markets.
Corporate bond spreads have been falling as have volatility indicators such as the VIX, which could indicate that investors are taking on risks despite the possibility of facing losses for which they might not be fully prepared.
""Signs of increased risk-taking were viewed by some participants as an indication that market participants were not factoring in sufficient uncertainty about the path of the economy and monetary policy,"" the minutes read.
""They agreed that the Committee should continue to carefully monitor financial conditions and to emphasize in its communications the dependence of its policy decisions on the evolution of the economic outlook; it was also pointed out that, where appropriate, supervisory measures should be applied to address excessive risk-taking and associated financial imbalances.""
Still, monetary policy will remain accommodative and will promote ""favorable financial conditions required to support the economic expansion.""

1627,By International Business Times,"<span>Jul 09, 2014 07:45AM ET</span>","China Economy: June Consumer Inflation Cools, More Stimulus Expected","By Greg Morcroft - China's consumer inflation cooled slightly more than expected in June, pointing to lingering weakness in the economy which could prompt Beijing to launch further stimulus measures to shore up growth.   The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent in June from a year earlier, missing the market forecast of 2.4 percent in a Reuters poll and down from 2.5 percent in May, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.   The producer price index (PPI) dropped 1.1 percent in its 28th straight month of decline, versus a market consensus for a fall of 1 percent, signalling that demand in the domestic economy remained lukewarm, despite some recent signs of stabilisation.   ""The weak inflation data leaves more scope for Beijing to step up use of targeted measures and even opens the opportunity window for blanket easing policy, such as an interest rate cut, to support economic growth,"" said Wang Jin, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai.
  Most economists believe Beijing will roll out fresh stimulus measures in coming months to ensure 2015 economic growth meets its target of 7.5 percent, but they are divided over whether it will stick to small-scale measures used so far or take more aggressive steps such as interest rate cuts or a nation-wide reduction in the amount of reserves banks must hold.   Policymakers are reluctant to announce a massive stimulus programme like the one adopted during the 2008-09 global financial crisis, which fueled inflationary pressures and left local governments saddled with mountains of debt.   ""Subdued inflation means monetary policy will have plenty of room to ease further over the coming months,"" Julia R Wang, an economist at HSBC said in a note to clients.

  ""We think the central bank will likely continue to do so in a targeted manner, provided that economic activity continues to show improvement.""   Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, also expected Beijing to take further action.   ""We expect Beijing to continue rolling out a slew of small-scale measures to deliver the around 7.5 percent annual growth target,"" he said in a note to clients.   The weaker June inflation reading was mainly due to lower pork and vegetable prices.   The CPI fell 0.1 percent in June from May, versus a forecast of no change in monthly prices.   In the first half of this year, average consumer inflation was 2.3 percent, way below the official ceiling of 3.5 percent set by the government at the start of the year.  FURTHER EASING NEEDED   Data for May and more recent factory and service sector activity surveys have suggested that China's economy was steadying after a weak start to the year.   But analysts said easing consumer inflation and persistent factory-gate deflation showed the recovery remained patchy.   A cooling property market poses an additional risk, and conditions there could determine just how much more may be needed on the stimulus front to stabilise the broader economy.   With inflation clearly not a threat for now, the government and central bank have the scope to loosen policies further to bolster the economy.   ""Further monetary policy easing across the board will still be needed to help lift confidence in China's economy,"" said ANZ economists in a research note to clients.   ANZ believes Beijing will reduce reserve requirement ratios (RRR) for all of the country's banks in the third quarter. So far, it has relaxed the requirement only for banks which are significant lenders to small companies and the farming sector.   Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said earlier this week that economic growth quickened in the second quarter from the previous three months. But he added the economy still faces downward pressure and further modest stimulus measures will be needed to boost activity.   The latest Reuters poll showed China's economy probably steadied in the second quarter, with annual growth holding firm at 7.4 percent, as recent government policy measures kick in.   Beijing has stepped up policy support in recent months to give a lift to economic growth, which dipped to a 18-month low in the first quarter.   Such measures include targeted reserve requirement cuts for some banks, quicker fiscal disbursements and hastening construction of railways and public housing projects.   The central bank said on Monday that it would use a mix of various monetary tools to keep overall liquidity at an appropriate level to support the economy.   (Editing by Kim Coghill)

The National Federation of Independent Business said on Tuesday its Small Business Optimism Index fell 1.6 points to 95 last month. 
Six of the NFIB's 10 indicators decreased, with about half of the decline in the overall index due to less confidence in future business conditions, the report said. 
U.S. economic data have given conflicting signs of health this year, with output falling sharply across the economy in the first quarter while hiring has looked much more robust. 

The NFIB index, often seen as a leading indicator for the economy, had risen for three straight months through May to its highest level since September 2007. 
Only two of the index's 10 components improved last month, with gains in job creation plans and unfilled job openings. That squares with official data that last week showed the economy created 288,000 jobs in June, well above economists' expectations.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's current account logged a higher-than-expected surplus in May, government data showed on Tuesday, as the trade deficit narrowed due to a decline in imports. 
But the improvement in the current account surplus could be temporary as export growth slowed in May, a sign that firms shifting manufacturing capacity overseas has made it difficult for exports to grow rapidly. 
The current account data also highlighted the need to stimulate domestic demand and the services sector as exports are no longer enough to drive economic growth. 
The surplus was 522.8 billion yen ($5.14 billion), more than the median forecast for a 403.6 billion yen surplus. It was the fourth consecutive month of surpluses, the finance ministry said. 
In April, the surplus was 187.4 billion yen. 
Exports rose 2.0 percent in May from a year ago, slower than a 6.2 percent annual gain in April. 
Imports fell an annual 0.4 percent, following a 6.6 percent annual increase in April. As a result, the trade deficit in May narrowed to 675.9 billion yen. 
The income surplus was 1.5 trillion yen in May, down 3.2 percent from the same period a year earlier, due to a decline in earnings from overseas subsidiaries of Japanese firms. 
Analysts expect the economy to contract in the second quarter after an increase in the sales tax, with a Reuters poll conducted in June projecting a 1.2 percent quarterly drop. 

The economy is expected to grow 0.6 percent in the current quarter, however, as consumer spending recovers from the tax hike and as government stimulus spending supports domestic demand.

The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade gap fell 5.6 percent to $44.4 billion. April's trade deficit was revised slightly down to $47.0 billion. 
Economists polled by Reuters had expected the deficit to narrow to $45.0 billion in May from a previously reported $47.2 billion shortfall. 
When adjusted for inflation, the deficit narrowed to $51.96 billion from $53.88 billion in April. 
Trade subtracted 1.5 percentage points from first-quarter gross domestic product. The economy contracted at a 2.9 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year. 
In May, exports increased 1.0 percent to a record high of $195.5 billion. Exports were driven by a surge in automobiles, parts and engines, which rose to a record high. Exports of consumer goods were also the highest on record. 
Imports fell 0.3 percent to $239.8 billion as petroleum imports tumbled to their lowest level since November 2010. Non-petroleum imports, however, hit a record high in May. 

That points to an acceleration in domestic demand, which cannot be satisfied with locally produced goods, and is consistent with expectations of a rebound in growth in the second quarter.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2014 08:10AM ET</span>","ECB says measures will push inflation up, but money-printing still possible","By Eva Taylor and Paul Carrel 
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A raft of policy measures introduced last month will help lift inflation and support bank lending but the European Central Bank stands ready to create money in future if required, President Mario Draghi said on Thursday. 
The ECB left interest rates steady a month after cutting them to record lows and pushing the deposit rate into negative territory for the first time - effectively charging banks for holding their money overnight to prompt them to lend to businesses. 
The measures unveiled in June also included extending the duration of unlimited cheap liquidity for banks until the end of 2016, and offering them a four-year loan plan. 
Detailing the loan plan, Draghi said banks must use the new funds to lend or else they will be made to pay back the money. He said last month's measures had further loosened the euro zone's monetary policy stance. 
""The monetary operations to take place over the coming months will add to this accommodation and will support bank lending,"" he told a news conference after the ECB left its key rate at just 0.15 percent. 
""As our measures work their way through to the economy, they will contribute to a return of inflation rates to levels closer to 2 percent."" 
The euro zone inflation rate held at 0.5 percent last month, well below the ECB's target of close to but below two percent and in what Draghi has called the ""danger zone"". If people and firms began deferring spending plans on the basis that they expected prices to fall, an economic downward spiral of the sort suffered by Japan could take hold. The ECB says its sees no sign of that. 
Draghi said the ECB's Governing Council was united in its willingness to launch into quantitative easing - essentially creating money to buy government or private debt from banks to keep borrowing costs low and boost spending - if inflation headed lower still. 
Risks to the recovery remained primarily negative, he added. 
""The Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to also using unconventional instruments within its mandate, should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation,"" Draghi said. 
Few analysts expect that to be remotely possible until late this year. The central bank has said last month's moves could take up to a year to take full effect. 
""Draghi maintained a dovish tone, but the threshold for further near-term easing is high,"" said Jan von Gerichchief strategist for developed markets at Nordea. The ECB president did little to sharpen the bank's forward guidance on interest rates, saying there was no direct link between the guidance and comments he made last month on unlimited cheap liquidity for banks until the end of 2016. 
Draghi said the ECB was watching the euro's exchange rate with great attention. Ahead of Thursday's meeting, Prime Minister Manuel Valls had renewed French calls for the ECB to help bring down an ""overvalued"" euro. 
""The exchange rate is not a policy target, but it has become important,"" Draghi said. ""It is definitely very important for our outlook on price stability."" 
TLTROs 
Banks will be charged a 10 basis point premium over the ECB's main funding operations for the TLTROs, or targeted long-term refinancing operations. 
By offering banks the four-year loans at low rates, the ECB hopes to entice banks to lend more freely, particularly to small- and medium-sized companies in the euro zone periphery. 
Banks across the euro zone were still digesting the technical provisions of the ECB's announcement, and several said it was too early for them to be specific on whether they would use the scheme and if it would help them boost lending. 
A spokeswoman for Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International, emerging Europe's second-biggest lender, said the bank had calculated potential use of around 500 million euros. 
""This doesn't mean we will take 500 million,"" he added. ""It is too early to say but at the moment it does not look unattractive."" 
The head of the Italian Banking Association said on Wednesday the new ECB scheme would be particularly successful in Italy. But the deputy chief executive of Greece's National Bank told Reuters his bank would not be able to use the operation to draw new funding, and carry out new lending, since it does not have extra collateral available to pledge to the ECB. Big questions remain, one being why banks would be likely to lend more before stress tests later this year at which they must demonstrate they have cleaned up their balance sheets. 
""Banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital and solvency position, thereby supporting the scope for credit expansion during the next stages of the recovery,"" Draghi said. 

The ECB chief said the central bank would move to a schedule of six-weekly rather than monthly meetings from next year, mirroring the frequency of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy gatherings. 
It will also start publishing regular minutes of its meetings, as the Fed and Bank of England do.

That was well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction but was the lowest level since October last year and also came in below a flash estimate of 54.2.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2014 03:00AM ET</span>",China to try GSK-linked investigator in secret: family friends,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The trial in China of a British corporate investigator and his American wife and business partner arrested a year ago after they did work for GlaxoSmithKline PLC will be closed to the public, two family friends with knowledge of the matter told Reuters Thursday. 
The detention of Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng has sent shockwaves through the foreign business community. For years, the community has relied on investigative firms such as the couple's Shanghai-based company ChinaWhys to better understand the Chinese business environment. 
In April 2013, GSK employed ChinaWhys to investigate an ex-employee suspected of sending anonymous emails, including the circulation of an intimate video of former GSK China head Mark Reilly with his girlfriend, as well as emails containing allegations of widespread bribery at the British drugmaker. 
Three months later, authorities detained Humphrey and Yu for illegally buying and selling private information. Chinese authorities have not openly made a link between GSK and the case against ChinaWhys. 
The couple were subsequently arrested, which typically means the police believe they have enough evidence for the case to be brought to trial. They are being held in Shanghai, but it is not known in which court they will be tried. 
U.S. consular officials had been informed on Wednesday when visiting Yu that they would not be able to attend the trial, and that the decision to keep the trial closed had been made on the grounds of privacy, according to the couple's family friends, who declined to be identified because of the apparent sensitivity of the case. 
The trial date has also been pushed back a week to Aug. 7 from July 29, the people said. 
The U.S. and British consulates declined to comment. 
CLOSED TRIALS 
In China, court cases involving state secrets or national security are regularly closed to the public. However, the couple's son said in a statement this case involved neither. 
""I am very worried that family and consular officials are not allowed to attend my parents' trial. This does not involve state secrets. This does not involve national security,"" Harvey Humphrey, 19, said in the statement to media. 
""I am surprised at this decision since China wants to promote openness and the rule of law and I hope that they will let me in."" 
One of the family friends said the defendants' lawyers had been required by the prosecutor to sign non-disclosure agreements. 
""The client doesn't even know what's going on,"" the person said. The reason for the non-disclosure agreements was not clear, but underscore the sensitivity of the case. 
Officials contacted by telephone at the Shanghai procuratorate and municipal intermediate courts said they did not know about the case. There was no listing of the trial on Aug. 7 or July 29 on an online docket for all of Shanghai's courts. 
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to faxed requests for comment. 
Chinese authorities last month charged Reilly and other colleagues with corruption, after a government investigation found the firm made billions of yuan from elaborate schemes to bribe doctors. 
GSK's tangled web of problems in China were highlighted in a lengthy draft report seen by Reuters. The report had been prepared by ChinaWhys and presented to GSK on June 6 Last year. 

The report into the origin of the video and emails did not reach a conclusion as to who was behind the actions. 
Humphrey previously worked for Reuters in Asia, Eastern Europe and the Balkans, according to the website of ChinaWhys.
